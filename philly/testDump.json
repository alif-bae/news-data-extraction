{"Content": "[ , America is going into a really critical presidential election with two big problems. You may have heard about one of them -- the laggard economy -- and the sort-of good news is that the November election should give voters a real choice between a candidate, Mitt Romney, committed tobeating back \"envy\" and defending the interests of the 1 Percent, and a candidate, President Obama, who at least understands how unfairness and inequality is ripping after the fabric of America.
