{"Content": "[I didnt watch much TV or follow too much news during my short mini-vacation last week, but on Wednesday night before bed I checked in briefly on MSNBCs \"Last Word\" with Lawrence ODonnell, just to make sure I hadnt missed any truly shocking headlines. And in fact, I was shocked by what I saw, although it was hardly what Id consider news. Almost the entire show was devoted to one presidential candidate: The bombastic, xenophobic, crass, frequently dishonest Republican billionaire Donald Trump. It was almost a half-hour into the show, and I wondered what else was going on on the world. (Had Greeces government suddenly found a cache of buried treasure to end its life-of-death financial crisis?) \"When we come back,\" ODonnell solemnly intoned, \"our panel will discuss the latest developments with Donald Trump!\" At the bottom of the screen was the chyron that MSNBC, CNN, and Fox News now use 23 1/2 hours a day to scream \"BREAKING NEWS,\" usually when nothing of the sort is occurring. The current crisis: Republican national chairman Reince Priebus had allegedly phoned Trump to plead with the $8.7 Billion Man (probably another lie, FWIW) to tone down his outrageous Mexican-bashing campaign. Im so old I remember when Donald Trump was going to save the USFL (spoiler alert: he didnt), not America. But now -- a month before the first debate, six months before the Iowa caucuses, and almost 17 months before America picks our 45th president -- the short-fingerted vulgarian hasnt just sucked all of the oxygen out of the 2016 presidential race, but has shattered a few windows from the ensuing vacuum. Liberals are clucking that Trumps arrival is the greatest thing to hit the Iowa caucuses since deep-fried corn dogs, that his unvarnished appeals to not-so-soft bigotry -- implying that arrivals from Mexico are criminals and rapists, tweeting and then deleting nasty talk about Jeb (Jeb!) Bushs Mexican-born wife Columba -- are revealing the former Party of Lincoln as a hot, racist mess. The media -- already chafing at the notion that 2016 would be a coronation for the tightly wound, tightly controlled, reporter-corralling Hillary Clinton -- is beside itself with glee. A Donald Trump \"exclusive\" media interview as about as rare as a stink bug in July, and they come before CNN or MSNBC or Fox News can remove the hyperbolic chyron -- \"Trump: Somebodys Doing the Raping\" -- from the last \"exclusive\" interview. And, the conventional wisdom goes, the GOP leadership is apoplectic. Priebus and other top party brass are said to be concerned that Trumps comments may kill any hope that Republicans have of winning back Latino voters in 2016 -- even if hes just verbalizing what the Tea Party base of the party is thinking, in the blunt language they prefer. Lindsey Graham, one of the 2 or 3 \"moderates\" on immigration among the Republicans Not-So-Sweet 16, hit the panic button today, stating: that if they party doesnt repudiate Trump, \"We will have lost the moral authority, in my view, to govern this great nation. The only think I can add to that is....wake up, everybody. Youre being jobbed. The man who wrote \"The Art of the Deal\" in the 1990s is back to teach us the art of the con, and this ones a blockbuster. I dont think its a conscious plot -- top Republicans just arent that smart... and neither are Democrats. But I do think Trump actually is a savior, not of America but of the GOPs faltering ambitions to re-capture the White House and restore the Bush family dynasty. When Priebus and Co. are leaking to the Times and the Post that theyve urged Trump to tone down the rhetoric, what theyre really doing is updating a classic kids fable: Dont throw us in the briar patch!, Think about the debates, which begin next month. The 2012 dog-and-pony-show-turned-clown-circus was an unmitigated disaster for Republicans -- an orgy of science denial and let-him-die health care plans. The 2016 debates will be Donald Trump -- and nine statesmen (sorry, Carly, who hasnt made the cut)...in comparison, anyway. The script is already written. The salivating cable moderator will ask Trump in the first 10 minutes about Mexico and rapists or what not, and The Donald will launch into his routine. The reply will certainly fall upon Jeb! -- serious and well-spoken, fluent in Spanish, husband and father of Latino-Americans, and he will utter a well-crafted response that will, in essence, be the 21st Century version of, \"Have you, at long last, no sense of decency.\" And the pundits will go wild, declaring the scripted reply to be historic -- the wheres-the-beef-no-Jack-Kennedy-Army-McCarthy moment that made John Ellis Bush \"a leader.\", Whats actually historic is this: Jeb Bush may be the least popular figure with the best chance of becoming president in the 239 years of the American experience. One of the two GOP candidates with near-perfect name ID has hovered in the polls at 15 percent of the minority party -- partly because most Americans get that this country was founded to prevent dynastic rule, not foster it. But hes running against 14 candidates evenly splitting most of the rest of the vote, and against Trump, wholl surely implode whenever he leaves his current wife for Miss Teenage America or gets a better reality-TV deal from Spike! TV or some such fiasco. And Bushs role in slaying the Trump \"monster\" will make him a moderate hero to TVs fickle talking heads, and he could even surge past his rival dynastic heir, Hillary Clinton. Thats the biggest part of the con, because Jeb! Bush is hardly a moderate. He governed Florida in a severely conservative fashion, with the usual mix of tax cuts for the rich and fire and brimstone on stem cell research and keeping Terri Schiavo alive against her husbands wishes, with the worst of corporate ed reform and climate denial thrown in for good measure. Reince Priebus and Friends dont want you talking about that, nor about the $29 million that Jeb! earned for...what exactly does he do, again?, True, their initial choice was to keep the partys over-the-top xenophobia hidden away in the attic, but the better way to deal with a political virus is to bring it out in the open and -- since killing this germ may be impossible -- at least tamping down the symptoms. Trumps over-the-top racism is the vehicle for Priebus and Bush to do exactly that. Indeed, at least in the short term, everybody wins! Trump gets the kind of eternal fame that only $8.7 (or $4.1) billion can buy. The GOP gets its straw man so that Bush the \"moderate\" hero can slay before a grateful publics eyes. The media gets what its craved for the last two decades, a real-time political reality show that would make the Kardashians cringe. And the Democrats get to re-live one of their most common experiences in most even-numbered years: Self-delusion. Of course, there is one loser here, the American voter. Because the other impact of Trump sucking the air out of 2016 is that he is absolutely strangling whatever hope there was of even a muted conversation about the real, actual issues -- not the Donald J. Trump Memorial Border Fence but how millions of Americans cant afford college tuitions with kids are staring at an ocean of debt, or how to reach the folks who still havent been reached with affordable health care insurance, or how the so-called \"American Dream\" slips further from 99 percent of folks. Of course, one candidate actually is talking about these things -- Bernie Sanders. So far, TVs Sanders coverage has been 50 percent, \"Look at the size of that crowd!,\" 20 percent, \"Dont forget hes a socialist,\" and 30 percent \"Now back to our panel on Donald Trump!\" The smart money -- the other billionaires who quietly finance the election, who are perfectly fine with either Jeb! or Hillary! -- is loving the Trump reality show, running out the 2016 clock before \"real issues\" gets a chance to clear its throat. Maybe Trump actually got one thing right.

{"Content": "[Is it really 1968 all over again? Thats the question thats posed in a remarkable and fairly provocative cover image on this weeks Time magazine (and to answer everyones question, yes, Time magazine is apparently still in business). Of course, history buffs (and who else would come to Attytood at this point?) know that a) 1968 was peak 1960s, the year that MLK and RFK were killed and that the police rioted in Chicago against anti-war protesters and that blacks and others rioted over other stuff, from Paris to Mexico City and b) it was particularly bad then in Baltimore. That April, six people perished in the Charm City in the citys uprising after the King assassination. Thats something to ponder when you compare the 1960s to today -- that thankfully today is much, much less lethal. Urban rioting across America in that era killed scores of people -- the most deadly, Detroit in 1967, claimed 43 lives, with the majority of the deaths caused in the police/military response. No one died in Ferguson or Baltimore...after Mike Brown and Freddie Gray did, of course. But I do think in many ways, the issues and the national mood are similar to what was going on 50 years ago. Again, people are talking about life down in the boondocks, and how can a nation like America can claim to be exceptional when such deep poverty exists. Suddenly, topics that seemed off the table -- like mass incarceration and extreme criminal sentencing -- are in play. Suddenly, too, people are doing things that surprise us -- like Baltimore states attorney Marilyn Mosbys surprisingly swift push for justice and her eloquent words on Friday morning. When I try to think of another public statement by an elected official that was so raw and so powerful, I must go way back to Robert Kennedys famous speech to a mostly black crowd in Indianapolis on the night Dr. King died... ...in 1968. Now, with peace descending over Maryland for the time being, Ive been thinking about 2016 -- a phenomenon and a fear, all of it flavored by what happened back then. First, the phenomenon, and what an unlikely one: Vermont independent/socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders and his maybe-quixotic-maybe-not quest for the White House, as a Democrat. I know, I know, a man of the far left (who, yes, to keep tying all of this to the 1960s, marched on Washington with King in 1963 and moved to Vermont in a hippie diaspora) not only cant get elected president, but he could never beat the all-powerful, somewhat-knowing Hillary Clinton. Right?, But to some people -- people who chatter or blog a lot and who never fail to vote in a Democratic primary -- Sanders call for a ballot box insurgency against the power of an American oligarchy is no longer extremist, but electrifying. We need a political revolution in this country involving millions of  people who are prepared to stand up and say enough is enough, and I want  to lead that,\" the Vermont senator said last week in announcing his candidacy. He promised to take on big money in politics and the influence of right-wing billionaires like the Koch Brothers, to raise taxes on the wealthy to pay for new infrastructure and fight climate change, and to shift direction on trade policy. His gruffly spoken words had barely left his mouth when more than 100,000 people donated an impressive $1.5 million to his campaign, an average pop of $43. So why assume Bernie cant beat Hillary? You never know in politics, but my guess would be for every Woodstock veteran writing impassioned Daily Kos diaries endorsing Sanders, theres three women at the bus stop shuttling between their two jobs who dont follow hardball politics and never heard of \"Bernie Sanders\" but who think Clinton is a nice lady and its about time we had a women president (which is it, by the way.) But I also sense that Democratic voters are feeling quite unmoored about 2016 -- that for the first time in a generation many of the party faithful care more about voting for a candidate they can believe in rather than the candidate they merely believe is the most likely to win. So if this really is 1968, as Time magazine told us, then Bernie Sanders is very much like another Democratic candidate in that iconic election -- a sometimes dour candidate from a frigid Northern state who took on the long-presumed nominee of the Democratic Party. Minnesota Sen. Eugene McCarthy didnt win the New Hampshire primary when he challenged sitting president Lyndon Johnson, but his 42 percent of the vote sent shock waves, and it was part of the reason LBJ stunned America and quit the race a few weeks later. But LBJ hadnt gauged the impact of being on the wrong side of Vietnam -- just as today Hillary Clinton may have misjudged how much she and her husband were on the wrong side of Wall Street deregulation and crime policy in the 1990s. In the end, McCarthy didnt get close to the nomination in 1968, but his impact was historic -- not just in ending Johnsons presidency but helping turn the public against the war. However... Heres my fear, and its based on history and those other similarities to 1968. Call it The Backlash. If Bernie Sanders is like Eugene McCarthy, remember that not only did McCarthy not become president, but neither did any other progressive-minded candidate in that race. Instead -- as chronicled fantastically in the Rick Perlstein book \"Nixonland\" -- the nation went, narrowly, for the harsh law-and-order campaign of Richard Nixon. Indeed, the centerpiece of the Nixon campaign that year were his TV spots (aided by a young staffer named Roger Ailes) that stoked the already very real fears of urban unrest. (See one of Nixons \"law and order\" ads below.) The policies that grew out of the election of Nixon and his vice president Spiro Agnew -- who rose to prominence with his stern response to that 1968 riot in Baltimore -- were the draconian drug laws and sentencing guidelines that have played such a key role in devastating modern Baltimore. Wash, rinse, repeat. And while -- as noted earlier -- theres no comparison in the scope and scale of the recent urban unrest to those 60s riots, the right-wing response in 2015 and in 2016 is certain to be just as strong, maybe stronger given the amplifying power of the Ailes-run Fox News and conservative talk radio. Its already starting, and its going to get worse. Marilyn Mosby -- a strong African-American woman speaking truth to power -- is going to be called every dirty name in the book, and probably a few that havent been invented yet. The ridiculous news leaks like the one suggested that Freddie Gray severed his own spine on purpose will keep coming -- and they will flow seamlessly into the 2016 GOP primary debates. In a party so out of step with the emerging American majority on everything from gay marriage to immigration to climate change, it wont be long before GOP strategists see a potential winner in promoting \"law-and-order\" and in blindly supporting your local police and \"my country right or wrong\" -- just as Richard Nixon, Spiro Agnew and Roger Ailes did nearly a half-century ago. After all. fear,-- remember George W. Bush and all the \"orange\" security alerts in 2004? -- was the only thing that gave the GOP a plurality of popular votes in any presidential election since the 1980s. That history is about to try to repeat, and it is going to be very, very ugly. And to think, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, the break-out candidate in the Iowa polls, pretends hes the reincarnation of Ronald Reagan. If he wants to win in 2016, he may want to go back a little further, to Richard Milhous Nixon. ]", "Date": "20150504", "Title": "[Baltimore, Bernie, and the coming 'Nixonland']", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/attytood/Baltimore-Bernie-and-the-coming-Nixonland.html\n", "Author": "[Will Bunch ]"}
{"Content": "[You probably missed it. The TV news gave little if any news coverage to the presidential campaign announcement of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (\"Hey, we have serious candidates like Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson and Ted Cruz to deal with,\" Im guessing theyd say) but the speech was definitely an organic barnburner live from Ben-and-Jerry-land. Sanders wasnt more than a minute or two into it when he belted out what should become his campaign motto:, Today, we stand here and say loudly and clearly that; \"Enough is enough. This great nation and its government belong to all of the people, and not to a handful of billionaires, their Super-PACs and their lobbyists.\", Enough is enough...when it comes to yawning gap between the Super Rich and everybody else in America. Its not surprising to hear this from Sanders, the only democratic socialist (to my knowledge) in the 2016 race for the White House. But other candidates have adopted some variation on this mantra: Income inequality was the only issue that Hillary Clinton raised in her campaign announcement video and was the topic of recent speeches. Over on the GOP side, the 2012-runner-up-turned-longshot Rick Santorum has ditched the man-on-dog stuff in favor of calling for a higher minimum wage. But Sanders is hitting this the hardest, so far. \"Today, we live in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world but that reality means very little for most of us because almost all of that wealth is owned and controlled by a tiny handful of individuals,\" he said. \"In America we now have more income and wealth inequality than any other major country on earth, and the gap between the very rich and everyone is wider than at any time since the 1920s. The issue of wealth and income inequality is the great moral issue of our time, it is the great economic issue of our time and it is the great political issue of our time. And we will address it.\", But how? Government undoubtedly could help speed up the change we need. Sanders -- whos fired up the most-engaged base of the Democratic Party even though it may be impossible to overcome the name ID and accumulated goodwill of Clinton with its rank-and-file voter -- listed a number of fixes: A $1 billion program to create blue-collar jobs building infrastructure, a higher minimum wage, the end of so-called \"free trade\" deals, and higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations. Indeed, the once-ridiculed idea of a $15 living wage is on its way to reality in Seattle, Los Angeles and elsewhere. But theres no infrastructure job to repair a Congress that is likely to remain in reactionary Republican hands for the next few cycles, nor to fix the red-tinged conservative statehouses and town halls in many parts of America. And there are other limits to what government can achieve in a capitalist society. Politics cant be the only way to bring about change. We need strong unions, And theres growing evidence that America is ready to welcome them back. Earlier this year, a major study by two economists for the International Monetary Fund (not normally a bastion of liberal thought) found that the weakening of unions accounted for a whopping 50 percent of the rise in income inequality since 1980, and specifically about half of the surge of income flowing to the top 10 percent. It makes sense; the diminished clout and in some cases disappearance of unions gives workers less power to get their share of company profits, less of a say in business affairs, and less political clout to elect candidates -- like Bernie Sanders -- with pro-working-class agendas. In the United States, union membership today is about half of what it was when Ronald Reagan fired striking air-traffic controllers in 1981. Unions grew not only less populated during those years, but less popular. Lets be honest: Some of that was the frenzy whipped up by the likes of Reagan and like-minded pols, or talk radio and Fox News, but some of it was self-inflicted, thanks to corrupt union bosses or legacies of discrimination. It was easy to forget what unions are needed for, but in the 21st Century more people are remembering. In the most recent Pew poll, support for unions has rebounded to a plurality, 48 percent, but for America to move forward that needs to grow higher. No one -- well, almost no one -- wants to live in a world where a handful of billionaires bestow their obscene fortunes on their pet philanthropies, while the human beings who actually work for them wonder how theyll handle the next medical crisis or pay college tuition, or where the hell their pension disappeared. So far, those whove fought the hardest have been the folks with the least to lose -- like the fast-food workers who risked their jobs to change the conversation about what comprises a living wage in America. But whats been even more impressive is that way that other low-wage workers, like home health care workers and janitors, have stood with them in solidarity. Imagine if that solidarity spread across every worker whos seen her or his pay freeze while the CEOs check skyrockets. That would be a lot more powerful than all 25 or whatever 2016 presidential candidates, cubed. Still, there are a lot of nattering nabobs, even here in supposedly blue-collar Philly, who just dont get it. They look at the political landscape and think that unions are somehow \"them.\" And with all the success that the 1 Percent and their allies have had in beating down the workforce, it might look like that from their ivory tower. But the American worker and what weve earned -- a fair wage, health care and other benefits, and basic dignity -- isnt \"them,\" but \"us.\" And look out, because were on the move...again.]", "Date": "20150527", "Title": "['Enough is enough!': Income inequality, Bernie Sanders ... and unions]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/attytood/Enough-is-enough-Income-inequality-Bernie-Sandersand-unions.html\n", "Author": "[Will Bunch ]"}
{"Content": "[UPDATE: Annnnd this pretty much proves my point. The business of America is business, and Supreme Court is still the business agent, even in the rays of \"Liberal Spring.\", When I think of the political zeitgeist in America in the 2010s, I think of one man -- Michael Bloomberg, the former non-partisan mayor of New York -- and of one night, October 1, 2011. Bloomberg was in Washington, D.C. that black-tie evening, hobnobbing with elites from President Obama to Sarah Jessica Parker and accepting a major award from the Human Rights Campaign for his tireless, outspoken support of LGBT rights, especially same-sex marriage. In New York, government of the people, and by the people, is now for all the people  as it should be, the billionaire mayor said in his acceptance speech. No place in the world is more committed to freedom of expression  religious, artistic, political, social, personal  than New York City. At the very moment, Bloomberg was speaking, New York Citys police force -- highly militarized, with its own spy outfit and even the ability to shoot down planes -- had kettled a huge march of peaceful protesters from the incipient Occupy Wall Street movement whod been guided onto the traffic lanes of the Brooklyn Bridge and was throwing more than 700 of them in jail. The Occupy movement was a short-lived spontaneous combustion fueled by massive income inequality, and that was a conversation that Bloomberg -- currently worth an estimated $34.5 billion, a great protector of Wall Street -- did not want to have on his streets. The mayor who was swooning about \"freedom of expression\" in NYC had his cops from working tirelessly to crush Occupy, from the cops who protected Lower Manhattans \"Charging Bull\" statue on Day One to the officers who crushed the Zuccotti Park encampment at the end. With his grey-flecked, practically Roman bearing, Bloomberg was almost a cartoon of the 21st Century benevolent dictator -- with zealous support of the liberal issues like LGBT rights, or handgun control that wouldnt topple a world order where almost all wealth flowed to the 1 percent. I thought again about the events of Oct. 1, 2011, this weekend, when I read the awed and even overwhelmed post-mortems about what indeed was a remarkably few days in the history of America. The New York Times, whose op-ed columnists were especially gushy, even coined a catchy phrase for such an historic moment: \"Liberal Spring.\", Will the name stick? Lets review what just happened in the \"Liberal Spring.\" The Supreme Court sided with the progressive argument on three major issues of great import: Legalizing same-sex marriage in all 50 states, saving Obamacare and inoculating health-care reform against future challenges, and upholding the broad liberal interpretation of the Fair Housing Act of 1968. President Obama, who basked in the glow of the Supreme Court victories, had another big win, getting congressional approval to negotiate in secret yet another free trade pact, this time with the Pacific Rim. In response to a horrific act of violence in Charleston, S.C. governors and other key politicos in the Solid South are starting the much-belated process of lowering a Confederate flag that had become a beacon to hate groups. Whoa, whoa, whoa...what was that middle one again? Not every win for President Obama is a victory for a progressive agenda, no matter what they say on Fox News. The trade deal -- the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP -- will be negotiated in secret by the Obama administration under the guidance of the same folks who pushed through two decades of so-called \"free trade\" that have decimated the American labor force, on terms that have been great for large multi-national corporations but have been terrible for the average blue-collar workers (not to mention the environment. The administration line on TPP is basically, \"Trust us, this one is going to be different\" -- but most everyday folks on the left and on the right dont trust them. Its the elected politicians of both parties, flush with corporate donations, who pushed the TPP, through. And yet the passage of the TPP trade authority bills -- a monumental moment for the American economy -- received minimalist news coverage, a piece of political driftwood that was washed over by rainbow lights at the White House (and at Disney World!)) and the Stars and Bars coming down in the Heart of Dixie (not to mention the real-life Shawshank Un-Redemption). I dont think the Michael Bloombergs of the world planned it this way -- frankly, theyre not that clever -- but I can imagine they were grateful for the distractions on free-trade week. To be extra clear, the last week was chock-full of wonderful news, from the long overdue developments in the Deep South to the lives that will be saved by access to health care to the pure joy of watching couples celebrate wedded bliss in a development that seemed unimaginable a few years ago. That fact that millions of Americans of all stripes shared in their joy made it even sweeter. Im just saying that \"Liberal Spring\" is warming trend and not a heat wave, that it would be a mistake to spike the football when sweeping social progress is still on the 20-yard-line. The Roberts Court veered left on social issues only after it had nearly driven America on a pro-corporate cliff looming on the right shoulder of the road. This is the same High Court, let us not forget, that gutted the key 1965 Voting Rights Act provisions that had been won at Selma, and cleared the way for unlimited and often secret corporate and billionaire election donations. The biggest beneficiaries of campaign mega-cash for the 2016 election -- Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush -- are also the current leaders in the early polls. The kind of corporate power behind the establishment candidates is also cool with gay rights and even Obamacare (backed, let us not forget, by Big Insurance) as long as the status quo remains intact. Indeed, the head of the biggest private Wall Street firm of Goldman Sachs is reported to have said privately hed be happy with either Bush or Clinton. That mockery of democracy, and not a rainbow flag, may be the lasting legacy of these nine Supremes. \"They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law,\" Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in his just and moving majority opinion granting the right of same sex marriage. And yet there are so many indignities that are either enshrined in the law or tolerated by our bought-and-paid for political elites -- a minimum wage so low that millions of workers need food stamps to put food on the table, a \"growing\" economy that has seen all of its gains -- literally, not a figure of speech -- go to the wealthiest 1 Percent, the unfettered ability of corporations to move jobs overseas and crush pension plans. Those policies are protected by a militarized police force that both locks up citizens and shoots civilians at rates that are unheard of anywhere else in the developed world. Where is their justice? Where is their dignity?, History isnt a straight line...its not even a line but a bundle of threats that sometimes veer off in unexpected ways. Two very different threads have ruled American discourse since the tumultuous 1960s. The so-called \"culture war\" has been mostly a righteous rout for liberals, culminating in this landslide of wins (presided over, appropriately, by a black president born in a year when many black Americans were still denied the vote.) But the wholesale destruction of the American middle class -- the 99 Percent -- was carried out during those same years of social progress. Any \"Liberal Spring\" on income inequality is still waiting for the snows of that long winter to melt. And with the opposition of the billionaire class, it could be a long hot summer or two -- or many -- before we see the same kind of victories.]", "Date": "20150629", "Title": "[UPDATED: Even in a \"Liberal Spring,\" the 99 Percent is getting jobbed]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/attytood/Even-in-Liberal-Spring-the-99-Percent-get-screwed.html\n", "Author": "[Will Bunch ]"}
{"Content": "[I caught a few minutes of an incredible spectacle on cable TV news on Friday night. Donald Trump had just held court with reporters in New Hampshire and now he was giving a speech in prime time - and the punditocracy was as giddy as 13-year-old girls reading the latest tweets from the boys in One Direction. Did you hear what Trump said about Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, calling him \"a clown\"?! Just listen to The Donald raving about the \"magnificent\" airport in Qatar (why?..who knows?) and how you can get a massage there but not Trump because \"I dont like people touching me,\" as his audience erupts in laughter. Other candidates draw crowds, if theyre lucky, but Trump comes with an audience, a human laugh track. They roared when he bragged about \"the summer of Trump,\" unconsciously echoing 2001s notorious \"summer of the shark.\", I saw the best political minds of the young generation -- smart analysts like Dave Weigel of the Washington Post and NBCs Kasie Hunt -- dragging themselves into this madness, torn between serious commentary and giggling. This was Chris Hayes on MSNBC -- the Serious One -- but they all struggled to break away from the Manhattan billionaires rock opera of a presidential campaign, even though most of the other top contenders for the White House were also making news on an hot Friday night in August. Here now was Hunt, live from Clear Lake, Iowa, the town where Americas rock n roll dreams famously crashed in a cornfield in 1959. Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and the other Democratic candidates were all slated to appear at an event there:, \"All right. Kasie Hunt, let`s take a listen for a second to see what Hillary`s reception is like inside that Wing Dings dinner in Clear Lake, Iowa. Take a listen.\", Finally! Grown-up time. Here was the former secretary state, already into her speech, addressing the peace deal aimed at stopping Iran from developing a nuclear bomb and also preventing the Middle East from erupting in World War III. The Democratic front-runner was offering a more full-throated endorsement of the deal than ever before. It sounded important. It sounded newsworthy -- more newsworthy than the state of the airport massage trade in Qatar. But to some producer at MSNBC, it sounded boring. The network cut away again after Clinton had uttered just 56 words. Host Hayes turned to his guest, Weigel: \"Dave, you were in Iowa. How do you think the state fair is going to receive the Donald?\" As the Post journalist answered about Trump, Hillary continued to speak on mute, shrunk and lowered to a corner of the screen as if she were Cindy Brady in the opening credits of \"The Brady Bunch,\" prattling on silently about matters like paid sick leave, a silent victim as \"the summer of Trump\" tugged political sanity into the frigid waters yet again. The joke is long past over. With autumn closing in, its getting harder to see how the short-fingered vulgarian of the American business world doesnt take his presidential odyssey at least to the gates of the GOP convention in Cleveland, if not beyond. Its starting to look like the author of \"The Art of the Deal\" may be able to pull off a leveraged buyout of a weak and vulnerable-to-takeover Republican Party that has lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections. Hes putting up very little capital -- political or otherwise -- to do this, just borrowing against accumulated Tea Party xenophobia and misogyny to gain a solid 25 percent, for now, of a Balkanized field. They may just be enough. His campaign isnt even based on an issue but a concept: The war against \"political correctness.\" That means anything that might be a campaign-crushing gaffe for any other candidate -- from John McCains war record to Megyn Kellys menstrual cycle -- only causes Trump to rise. Offensive comments arent a bug in Trump World. theyre a feature. It all raises two big questions. How did we get here? And how in the name of God do we get out?, A brilliant social scientist and academic all but predicted the rise of Donald Trump. His name was Neil Postman, an NYU professor, and in 1985 he wrote his masterpiece called Amusing Ourselves to Death, arguably a blueprint for the decline and fall of the American experiment in democracy. Postman argued that predictions of coming totalitarian censorship -- think George Orwells 1984 -- had missed the mark and that with the rise of TV the greater likelihood was that entertainment values would drown out serious political debate. \"How delighted would be all the kings, czars and fuhrers of the past and commissars of the present,\" Postman wrote, \"to know that censorship is not a necessity when all political discourse takes the form of a jest.\", That same year, 1985, the godfather of the political movement that begat Donald Trump was skyrocketing onto the scene. Howard Stern, so-called \"shock jock,\" was making his move to FM radio in New York and becoming the \"King of All Media\" by waging war on \"political correctness.\" (Sound familiar?) Like so many things, the rise of Stern -- and his TV doppelganger Morton Downey Jr. to be celebrated this week in a CNN documentary -- came from the ashes of the 1960s and 70s. Conservatives had won the political wars -- it was Reagans \"Morning in America\" -- but liberals had made huge gains in the culture wars, including growing recognition for the rights of minorities, women, and gays. With American manufacturing and the decent working-class jobs that went with it in a state of collapse, with the Watergate generation bitter and cynical about politicians, young males -- primarily but not exclusively blue collar -- felt their world was under assault. In the popular view of Stern and his fellow \"shock jocks,\" they were the only telling it like it is -- even if \"like it is\" was, at least during Sterns rise to fame in 1980s, before he toned it down a little, a toxic stew larded with homophobia, racism and sexism. He was using the freer speech wrought by the 1960s not to uplift, but to insult -- especially anyone who threatened white male heterosexual hegemony. In a foreshadowing of Trump, Sterns seeming \"gaffes,\" like pretending to call Air Florida and ask for a one-way ticket to D.C.s 14th Street Bridge after a jetliner crashed there in 1982, inevitably led to promotions and more riches. A lot of dudes ate this up. When Stern published his first book in 1994, Private Parts (which said of L.A. police violence victim Rodney King, \"they didnt beat the idiot enough\"), it not only became a No. 1 best seller, but 10,000 people -- \"10,000 Maniacs,\" the tabloids screamed -- lined up outside a Manhattan bookstore to meet him. Wrote one columnist: \"I haven seen such a concentration of white men in one place in Manhattan since the hockey playoffs.\" The loosely libertarian Stern and his followers were passionate and firmly apolitical -- but that would change. Increasingly, starting with Rush Limbaugh in the late 1980s, a new generation of radio talkers took advantage of the end of the so-called \"fairness doctrine\" in licensed communications and a need for content on AM radio to adapt the political incorrectness of the shock jocks to the promotion of conservative Republican politics. Indeed, it was a failing \"morning zoo\" shock jock, Glenn Beck, who for a short time at the dawn of this decade would find the sweet spot where radio histrionics could command a political movement, the hard core of the Tea Party. The beauty of Trump is that he has eliminated the middleman. Political incorrectness has evolved from a ratings ploy to a political platform, amid the evolution from \"Gay Tarzan\" radio skits to a crass campaign for the nations highest office. The apolitical 20-somethings who lined up with their copies of Private Parts are now 40- and 50-somethings with a mortgage and a shrinking paycheck...and they vote!, Indeed, Trump is the perfect storm of 21st Century excess. Worried about the influence in politics of billionaires like the Koch Brothers or George Soros? Just have a billionaire run himself -- problem solved. Think that modern political campaigns have become nothing more than elaborate reality shows with the keys to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue voted to the winner by our national studio audience?Donald Trump learned how to entertain and influence people on his own reality show, \"The Apprentice.\" He says whatever is on his mind, and its not only conservatives who agree with the best of his zingers, such as his explanation of how he and his billionaire friends buy conventional politicians. Indeed, theres only one problem with the rise of Donald Trump. Hes a demagogue -- arguably the most dangerous one that America has seen in generations. His \"truth telling\" and one-liners have been built atop of a brownfield of poisonous industrial-strength xenophobia. Its impossible to ignore the intentional non-gaffe that launched his campaign and sent his poll numbers skyward, calling Mexican immigrants criminals and \"rapists.\" His motto \"Make America Great Again\" is in fact a thinly veiled threat against The Other. That threat that sprung to life this week as the Trump campaign unveiled an immigration policy that includes the forced march of 11 million people -- uprooting families that have been in America for years -- and also goes against 100 years of settled constitutional law regarding citizenship. His first so-called \"policy plan\" spits at the idea of Congress and consensus, spits harder at the U.S. Constitution, and puts its faith in just one thing: The cult of the personality of Donald Trump. And weve seen how that movie turns out. Look, the odds remain strong that Trump loses -- that he goes all Ross Perot and quits over some petty grievance, or that the GOP establishment unifies in a stop-Trump effort (although its hard to see where that level of political skill would come from). And even if Trump shocks the world and wins the Republican nomination, the so-called \"Obama coalition\" of non-whites, coastal educated professionals, \"waitress moms,\" gays, young people, et cetera -- which gets bigger every four years -- will probably rally around the eventual Democratic nominee. On the other hand, historys dustbin of the last 100 years is littered with despotic rulers who started out as a joke until they werent, who ran on a platform of restoring national greatness against the alleged pollution of outsiders, of immigrants or ethnic minorities, who manipulated the real and perceived grievances of the masses to get their foot in the doorways of power, and who had little use for the niceties of diplomacy or even the rule of law once they got in. The time to stop laughing at Trumps demagoguery and take it seriously is today, not next July and heaven forbid not in November of 2016. When it comes to democracy in America, to quote Yogi Berra, it gets late early out there. American has survived civil war, slavery and segregation, and all types of crises.

{"Content": "[Im sure it was Dean Martin, or somebody, who said once, \"Every day is the anniversary of something.\" Or at least its come to seem that way, after more than a half-century of media-drenched post-war culture, all celebrated now on the 5th, 10th, 25th, 40th and 50th anniversary, and sometimes more often than that. That said, I personally dont mind anniversary stories, especially in an era of limitless pixels. It helps to understand where you are sometimes -- by reconsidering where you used to be. Thursday marks the 4th anniversary of the Occupy Wall Street protests, which started in Lower Manhattan on a balmy Saturday, eventually spread to Philadelphia and several hundred cities and towns, across the country and around the world -- and was all but gone by the chilling winds of Thanksgiving. First they ignored it, as NYC cops ringed the famous Charging Bull near the Battery and blockaded Wall Street itself, thwarting a mid-sized band of rebels in their scheme to protest income inequality and other grievances by occupying the main thoroughfare of American usury. Then, after a brief period of euphoria -- finding a home in Zuccotti Park and drawing thousands of like-minded souls to their communal, if somewhat vague, cause -- they ridiculed it, as a lynch mob of talk-radio hosts and other pundits fell back on the old \"dirty smelly hippie\" canard (the same tired schtick that turned Ronald Reagan from a B actor to a governor and then a president). Then, finally, they fought it -- driving out the last of the Occupy protesters in midnight raids, police arresting some on bogus pretenses. Then, according to the famous dictum, Occupy won, right?, Well...no and yes, but -- four years out -- the answer is definitely more \"yes\" than \"no.\" To be sure, the movement looked like more of a failure in the frigid winter of 2011 -- its aims still unfocused, its camps overwhelmed by the needs of Americas permanent homeless, its members seemingly scattered to the bitter winds at the end. But fast forward four years, and things look a lot different. Real solutions to income inequality -- most notably, the $15 living wage -- are gaining in some cities and states and will take center stage in the 2016 race for the White House. Just as important, the derided-as-clueless Occupy movement actually created a template for mass protest in the 21st Century. Activists who ringed the White House have helped to stall the noxious Keystone XL pipeline and the #BlackLivesMatter movement has flooded streets and brought real reform from Ferguson to New York, where a liberal mayor has ended stop-and-frisk. Now, flash forward to this weekend. In Canada, a left-wing party that barely registered at the dawn of the 21st Century, the New Democratic Party, or NDP, is holding to its lead in the polls as our friendly neighbor to the north elects a new government next month. Under the current scenario, the NDP and its leader Thomas Mulcair have an outstanding chance of ousting long-time incumbent Conservative PM Stephen Harper (probably in a coalition with the centrist Liberal Party, under Canadas parliamentary system). And if Mulcair takes office, he will surely kill the Keystone XL project at the source, throw a monkey wrench into the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, and raise taxes on corporations to fund social programs. Look at whats happening right here at home, where \"democratic socialist\" Sen. Bernie Sanders continues to draw surprisingly large crowds, even in bastions of the old Confederacy, and is actually widening his lead over \"liberalism lite\" Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire and Iowa, as a growing number of Democrats grasp for the real thing, a candidate they know will zealously attack the power of large corporations and the political influence of the top 1 Percent. Most importantly, look across the pond to the biggest story of the weekend, the ascension of far-left, longtime gadfly Jeremy Corbyn to become the leader of the United Kingdoms Labour Party, which puts Corbyn in line to challenge their Conservative prime minister, David Cameron, when the next election is held in the spring of 2020. Corbyns takeover of the party that not long ago gave the world Iraq War hawk Tony Blair went from improbable to inevitable, and it brought a lot of Chicken Little sky-is-falling clucking from Cameron, Blair and from well-fed armchair pundits everywhere. Heres what the \"wild-eyed radical\" Corbyn published in the Guardian newspaper after his selection on Saturday:, It is clear, too, that the prime minister will soon again be asking us to bomb Syria. That wont help refugees, it will create more. Isis is utterly abhorrent and President Assads regime has committed appalling crimes. But we must also oppose Saudi bombs falling on Yemen and the Bahraini dictatorship murdering its democracy movement, armed by us. Our role is to campaign for peace and disarmament around the world. For the Conservatives, the deficit is just an excuse to railroad through the same old Tory agenda: driving down wages, cutting taxes for the wealthiest, allowing house prices to spiral out of reach, selling off our national assets and attacking trade unions. You cant cut your way to prosperity, you have to build it: investing in modern infrastructure, investing in people and their skills, harnessing innovative ideas and new ways of working to tackle climate change to protect our environment and our future. That is what the punditocracy calls \"crazy talk\"? If thats the case, Ill happily live out the rest of my life in the insane asylum with Corbyn in charge. But then, the glass is still only half full for the left. Of the three, only Canadas Mulcair has a better than 50 percent chance to actually lead at this point. In the case of Sanders, while he continues to astonish, his real feat may end up as pushing the eventual Democratic nominee towards a purer shade of liberalism. Corbyn sure seems like a longshot to ever lead England. What these men (yes, theyre men...I saw someone call them \"bro-cialists\"..haha) share is that theve moved the entire political discussion toward the left side of the highway, so that things like a liveable wage for the working poor, an end to mass incarceration or over-dependence on fossil fuels now seem possible in a way that was unimaginable in the 2000s. But theres also a flip side. Voters all over the world are on the move -- but not always to the left. Across Western society, from the ends of Eastern Europe to the Iowa caucuses, xenophobic anti-immigrant candidates are gaining strength. Across the Atlantic, right-wing parties railing against immigration are plucking voters from the dead and decaying center, in some places more rapidly than the rival left-wing parties are growing. The prime minister of Hungary who wants to keep out refugees who arent Christian is just a stones throw, politically and morally, from Donald Trump calling Mexican arrivals \"rapists\" and promising an unprecedented Diaspora of 11 million undocumented immigrant families -- and becoming the de facto voice of modern Republicanism. Whats odd is that the parties on the far left and the parties on the far right are, in one sense, reacting to the same thing: The utter failures of 20th Century-style capitalism. The difference is simply a matter of whom to blame for harsh austerity policies in Europe, for stagnant wages and middle-aged, middle-class folks forced from the job market here in the U.S. The center-right and center-left politicians -- the Bush and Clinton families, the Blairs and Camerons and Harpers of the world -- have been given every opportunity to make things work, and voters are exhausted and exasperated. Liberals see the centrists as too cozy with the billionaire class, doling out tax breaks at the expense of the middle, while folks on the right think the politicians have allowed runaway immigration to lower labor costs for big business (or give more votes to the Democrats). Liberals want to blame the billionaires, while conservatives want to blame the folks who were forced to become migrants by economic inequality or military adventurism. One of those things makes more sense to me. But one thing its hard to disagree with: 2015 will be remembered as the year the political center died. Which means that 2016 may be the most interesting year -- and the most fraught with peril -- of any political season weve seen in our lifetimes.

{"Content": "[I cant remember exactly who, when, or even what channel it was the other day when I heard them talking about Hillary Clinton running for president. Heck, if they moved all the talking heads talking about Hillary on the airwaves to just one 24/7 cable news channel, that would drastically reduce the air time now given over to rumor, idle speculation and the occasional rare nugget of factual information about the woman who would be our 45th president. Anyway, one of the professional pundocrats was arguing that the Democratic frontrunner faces tough sledding -- that she was derailed in 2008 because she represented the past in what became \"a change election,\" and now the 2016 election will be about change all over again. If you think like a TV pundit racing from Green Room to Green Room, that actually makes sense. In a recent Wall Street Journal poll, just 32 percent of the nation thinks that America is on the right track, a number thats held fairly level through most of the last two presidencies. The public rates its leaders poorly as well -- Congress has approval numbers lower than pretty much every group besides ISIS, and the flood of folks volunteering to join the Islamic State makes me wonder even about that. (Has anyone ever gone on Twitter and pledged allegiance to Congress?) President Obamas supporters do a jig when his numbers eek up to 50 percent. Beyond the numbers, many have given up on the American Dream. The nation, outside of its trusty hedge-fund operatives, hasnt seen a raise in close to a generation, and breaking the career circle of life for the 99 Percent seems based more on who you know than what you can accomplish. Still, having said all that, I dont think 2016 is a \"change\" election, not at all. In fact, if Obama could run for a third term, I think hed win and get the same 52-53 percent that he got the first two times, maybe even slightly better as the nations demographics continue to evolve. I just dont see much evidence that the American voter is looking for change next year. In fact, I think the notion of change scares the living beejeezus out of the electorate right now. First of all, change from what? Its true that two-thirds of Americans dont like the direction of things -- a stew of conservatives who \"want their country back\" and those on the left and the center who bemoan the current state of economic inequality -- but I also think the vague general direction of Obamas two terms is the direction that the majority wants to be going. Job numbers that have gone up (sometimes unspectacularly) every month since 2010, as opposed to the Great Recession. Wars winding down instead of starting up. Folks getting insurance cards instead of bankruptcy notices. And some of the best things about Obamas president are bad things that didnt happen, dogs that didnt bark. A majority of Americans dont want to jump that ship. Indeed. a fair number of people want to throw more coal (or hopefully something that burns cleaner) onto the fire and speed it up. It is at this odd moment in the journey that Hillary Clinton strides to the top deck and grabs again for the steering wheel. Todays two-minute-and-15-second ad/announcement that she is indeed running for president in 2016 proved one thing -- that her large team of highly paid consultants, pollsters and advisers have learned quite a lot over the last seven years. This time the focus is all on Time magazines 2006 Person of the Year -- You! -- as dramatized by a whos who of Center-Left Central Casting, a melting pot of folks expecting babies, jobs or retirement or planning their gay wedding, something that 2008 Hillary (also, 2008 Obama) wasnt ready for. The candidate appears in the last 45 seconds of the reel -- reassuring and rehearsed -- to tell Americans that shes here for us. But the subliminal message is something more powerful. \"Yes, you know exactly what youre getting with me...but 53-55 percent of you are OK with that. Anybody else could screw things up to high heaven -- why would you want to take that risk?\", Over at New York magazine, Jonathan Chait summed it up pretty well: \"The argument for Clinton in 2016 is that she is the candidate of the only major American political party not run by lunatics.\" Indeed, that explains why theres so much Democratic support for Hillary, even when the liberal wing of the party greatly prefers the bona fide, unscripted anti-Wall Street populism of Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Clinton is the best chance of not taking us back to 2003, or worse. In politics, fear always conquers love. The weird thing is that I think on a raw, untapped level, the American voter does want change, radical change. Most folks know that Hillary Clinton reading the script on income inequality doesnt change the fact that shes the preferred candidate of Goldman Sachs. But voters are also realists, and they can see what the realistic options are for 2016. Some day, maybe after one term of Clinton 45, maybe later, the right messenger with the right message will appear over the horizon.

{"Content": "[I have to confess feeling more alienated than ever about American presidential politics these days...most of it, anyway. And it feels strange for a guy who, as a 13-year-old kid, stayed up past midnight in a summer vacation cottage listening to the 1972 Democratic convention on a scratchy transistor radio, and who never thought seriously about a career in anything besides journalism after reading \"The Boys on the Bus\" about that years White House campaign. This weeks World Series of campaign kickoffs -- a Murderers Row (oops...wrong Bush) of Hillary Clinton, Jeb! Bush and clown prince Donald Trump -- was a dose of weak methadone for this lifelong political junkie. I could only force myself to \"watch\" the announcements on Twitter, if at all. I didnt even have anything clever to add to the social-media snarkfest record about Trump, maybe because I couldnt think of anything funnier to say than, \"Donald Trump is running for president.\", Clinton presented a solidly bland liberal agenda, minus anything so liberal that it might strike her backers on Wall Street as too rabble-rousing. The former Secretary of State now seems completely uninterested in foreign policy, including a trade agreement that she pushed for before learning that every Democrat (and most everyone else, too) doesnt want it. Jeb! is already something of a laughingstock with an exclamation point!...unaware of who caused global warming or of how many living Americans will never again vote for someone named \"Bush\" (or \"Jeb!\" for that matter). Trump forgets who won World War II. It would be easy to say that none of it matters, but thats a little too cynical, even for me. What happened after the 2000 election, after all, is the danger of seeing the major candidates as Tweedle-dum and Tweedle-Dee. And curmudgeonly truth-teller Bernie Sanders has made the 2016 race more interesting than it seemed just a couple months ago. But while there are real differences between Hillary and Jeb (Im sorry...I cant do the exclamation point anymore), theres no real excitement. Maybe thats because it was reported in Politico not long ago that the ultimate Wall Street titan, Goldman Sachs Lloyd Blankfein \"has indicated he would be fine with either a Bush or Clinton presidency.\" Sounds about right. Where are the profiles in courage in 2015 and 16? Not on the focus-group-fueled podiums of presidential campaign announcements. Look instead to the streets, where people are now fighting when they have nothing, or perhaps everything, to lose. If anyone Ive watched in the public arena in the last month deserves an exclamation point, its not Jeb...but Sarina!, Sarina Santos was a baggage handler at Philadelphia International Airport -- a 30-year-old Frankford woman trying to raise 4 kids on the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. But like most low-wage workers, her meager check was still needed to put any food on the table at all. When her employer -- a subcontractor at the airport -- labored to throw up roadblocks to a $12 living wage that the city has been seeking to mandate since last year, the easiest thing would have been to keep silent. But Sarina Santos did not do the easy thing. She spoke up to anyone who would listen, including an aide to Pope Francis who was here ahead of Septembers papal visit. Not long after that meeting, the family breadwinner was fired from her job for reasons that are in dispute, although she believes the real cause was her labor activism. \"Living is even harder now than it was before,\" Santos wrote in the Daily News earlier this month. \"The bills dont stop coming because Im not working. The kids will need watching now that school is out. Why should workers like me bear this kind of burden? We want to do better, but subcontractors at the airport have stripped us of our dignity and respect. I fight because I have friends at the airport with young children who are struggling.\", But in the midst of a desperate situation, something remarkable happened. Ministers and others rallied -- literally -- to support Santos and her cause. City Council used its leasing powers as a political weapon on behalf of the low-wage workers, and last week the workers won, gaining an agreement that will make the $12 wage a reality and allow employees a chance to unionize. Thats the result of real courage -- but its been a missing ingredient during the last few decades of what author Steve Fraser has rightfully pegged in his recent book as an American \"Age of Acquiescence.\" Look at the growing number of cities taking giant strides for employees, from the $15 wage to mandatory sick leave. The victories didnt start with politicos on the top, but from regular folk putting their bodies on the line -- taking great risks, but also finding solidarity. The 1 Percent still conquers by dividing everyone else. But they call the rest of us the 99 Percent for a reason...we need to realize that were all in the same large boat. The fast-food workers walking off their jobs against wage theft ARE the white collar workers asked to stick around and train their foreign replacement. The professional who has to battle to protect health insurance for his or her family IS the home health-care aide or the security guard seeking a paycheck large enough to get off food stamps. But the biggest thing we need to realize is that we need not so much to listen, but to act. To become not just voters every four years, but activists every day. Maybe its this late spring heat wave talking, but the political blandishments coming out of Miami, or Roosevelt Island, or Donald Trumps fright wig all feel like so much hot air right now.]", "Date": "20150617", "Title": "[Hillary, Jeb!...and the people who are actually saving America]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/attytood/Hillary-Jeband-Americas-Next-Real-Saviors.html\n", "Author": "[Will Bunch ]"}
{"Content": "[To the nattering nabobs of negativism in the lamestream media, the guy is nothing less than a human gaffe machine. How could you not question a dude who has the nerve to present himself as ready for prime time in the 2016 White House race when he cant even answer the most basic questions on evolution or whether the current president of the United States loves the United States, when he thinks that labor unions are a threat comparable to ISIS and when he maintains the biggest \"foreign policy decision\" of his lifetime was Reagan firing domestic air traffic controllers?, Thats not all. Hes uncharismatic and humorless. Hed be the first president since the World War II-era not to have a college degree. In an age of political apathy, he can get 50,000 people to show up in blizzards or 2-degree weather to protest his policies. Over 900,000 people signed petitions for a recall election -- one of only two U.S. governors to suffer that indignity in the last 94 years. Hes still the subject of a never-ending criminal probe into his campaign fund-raising activity. The pundit class thinks it has a read on Wisconsin GOP Gov. Scott Walker, but of course this effete corps of impudent snobs has it all wrong. That in fact is the very essence of the Scott Walker phenomenon. Indeed, the shared resentments of the Republican base could -- emphasis on the word \"could\" -- propel this dour enemy of Working People right into the Oval Office. A lot could happen between now and next July on the road to Cleveland (heh), but personally Id rate Walker with by far the best chance of winning the GOP nomination...much, much better than the hugely overrated Jeb Bush. And if that happens, the reality is that Scott Kevin Walker has a 50 percent chance of becoming the 45th president of the United States. That makes him the most dangerous man in America. The Walker bubble is one of those things that makes you want to kick yourself -- because you should have seen it coming. Ironically, I did think going back to 2013 that the next GOP nominee would be a bland governor from the Midwest, but I thought a John Kasich of Ohio was much more likely. In a state with a long progressive streak that went from Obama in 08 and 12, I thought riled-up labor voters -- angry over his 2011 push to quash public-employee unions -- would put an early end to Walkers career, first in the 2012 recall, or surely when he ran for re-election in 2014. But that which didnt kill him made him stronger. Flash forward to 2015. Some folks -- pundits, liberals, the people youd expect -- have already made a deal of the fact that when Walker started making money in the private sector before hed earned a college degree, he didnt stick around for a diploma. But the voters who look down their noses on Walkers drop-out are the voters who would never vote for a candidate like Walker in the first place; his passive-aggressive stance on the whole notion of \"liberal\" college education only makes the GOP base love him more. Its Resentment Politics 101, from the playbook drawn up by Coach Richard Nixon. Ditto from those annoying \"liberal: reporters hounding Walker on evolution or whether Obama is a Christian. Every time the press goes after Walker, he gains another three points in the Iowa straw poll. Ironically, hes been a pretty mediocre governor for Wisconsin -- his \"business utopia\" in Badger State has actually lagged the rest of America in wage and job growth. That doesnt matter either. Politically, only two things matter about Walker. The man is on a dual mission: To destroy collective bargaining, and to replace liberal arts education with a kind of 21st Century trade school-ism. Look, we all know that the once all-American notion of learning things -- things like philosophy, poetry -- for the pure love of learning was already comatose long before anyone heard of Scott Walker, but the Wisconsin governor is eager to put the final nail in the coffin. Hes seeking to devastate the University of Wisconsin with $300 million in budget cuts; his office even released a blueprint that would eliminate the so-called Wisconsin Idea of the public universitys higher mission of knowledge and the truth and replace it with a new goal: \"to meet the states work-force needs. The governor backtracked on that piece of his plan (he backtracks on a lot of things) but his bigger vision, or lack of vision, for higher education remains clear. With a Republican-led Congress to enact his ideas, a Scott Walker presidency in 2017 would be a nightmare, an American dystopia. Scott Walkers America would become a beehive of worker drones -- trained to perform profit-seeking tasks but thwarted in any effort to think freely and independently, stripped of any rights to join together and fight for pay that would match their productivity, or for benefits that would treat them as human beings and not robot cogs on a bland assembly line. The cruel joke -- as weve learned from Walkers resume in Wisconsin -- is that this plan wont work for the millions who would elect him, only for his billionaire backers like the Koch Brothers. But his vision for America is less as a functioning republic, and more as a profit center. Theres certainly a good chance that the voting coalition -- 52 percent of the American electorate and growing -- that twice elected President Obama will see through Walker like a downtown Apple Store. But its just as likely that a Democrat (cough, cough...Hillary Clinton) will stumble and this Wisconsin badgerer will take the oath on January 20, 2017.

{"Content": "[, They just wont quit, will they? The New Castle News (where I get most of my information these days*) is reporting that Harrisburg legislative powerhouse Sen. Dominic Pileggi has yet another scheme in which Pennsylvania would awarda number of electoral votes to the losing candidate under a system not used in any of the other 49 states. As you may know, the losing candidate in every presidential election in Pennsylvania since 1988 has been a Republican. In 2012, President Obama got just under 52 percent of the popular vote and all 20 electoral votes. Thats because Pennsylvania -- like 47 other states and D.C. -- awards those electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis. (Two smaller states -- Nebraska and Maine -- award some of their votes by individual congressional district.), At this particular quirky moment in American history, there are a surprising number of states that have Republican legislatures and governors but are trending solidly Democratic for president, including Wisconsin, Michigan, Virginia, Florida...and Pennsylvania. As if by magic, lawmakers in each of these states showed up for the new year with schemes to pick presidential electors on a variation of the Maine-Nebraska method. Because the Democratic vote has been so overwhelming in some urban congressional districts, with the Republicans winning more suburban and rural districts by by smaller margins, the swing in electoral votes could be dramatic. In Pennsylvania, a change proposed by some GOP lawmakers last month would have given 2012s Mitt Romney 12 of the 20 state electoral votes, despite garnering just 47 percent of the popular ballot. Similar schemes were reduced in other key states...and then something remarkable happened. Common sense. Procedurally, the only thing that could have stopped such legislation was a sense of decency, at long last, and many key Republicans looked at this scheme and couldnt stomach it -- even GOP die-hards like Wisconsins Paul Ryan and Governors Rick Scott (Fla.) and Bob McDonnell (Va.) In Pennsylvania, the scheme also faltered because some powerful Republican swing district congressmen feared that forcing the 2016 Democratic White House hopeful to intensely compete for an electoral vote in their home district could cause them to lose. So comes now Pileggi with Plan B. The district scheme is out; instead, electoral votes would be awarded proportionally, guaranteeing the loser would pick up some free tallies that he or she would not have received under the systems used by every other state. In 2012, loser Romney would have received 8 of the 20 electoral votes. Last year, that would not have made a difference. In 2016, in a closer race....who knows?, Last night, a Democratic state lawmaker, Rep. Mike Sturia, told the website Think Progress that Pileggi, his legislative allies and Gov. Corbett could all but click their heels and make this thing the law of the land in just four days:, They could have it out of the House in three days and it could go over to the Senate and they could have it out of there in three days and it could go to the governors office and he could sign it. . . . The Senate can suspend the rules and have it passed in less than 24 hours. [The House] has to have a 2/3s majority to suspend the rules so usually we can at least make them do the three days. Call me a crazy optimist, but Im betting in the end this wont happen. I sure hope it doesnt. For one thing, Pennsylvania has way too many problems -- falling bridges and failing schools come to mind -- to waste valable hours on this election-stealing nonsense. In the bigger picture -- and I doubt this could happen -- I would love to see an amendment to ensure that federal elections are governed by one federal set of rules. Thats just common sense -- imagine the fan outcry if the NFL used a different rulebook for games played in Louisiana than it did for contests in Maryland. If pro football can do it, why cant America.

{"Content": "[They dont call Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul \"the most interesting man\" in American politics for nothing. Shortly before yesterdays election, Paul spouted off on the Republican \"brand\"; he said, flatly, that for many voters it \"sucks.\" And in a sense, he surely was right. The GOP brand name is toxic to large segments of the American electorate -- Latinos who feel beat up by the immigration hawks, or blacks who feel marginalized by new laws that restrict voting, not to mention that long-time favorite of Attytood commenters, \"the war on women.\" Its why the party has lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections -- you know, the ones where they cant draw up districts that look like Rorschach tests -- and is still the White House underdog in 2016, at least if Hillary Clinton runs. But if the Republican brand \"sucks,\" where does one begin with the Democratic brand? Is it Arbys? K-Mart? Have they become the Microsoft Zune of 2010s politics? Because make no mistake, what happened last night was a massive repudiation of the Democratic Party and especially the party brand. It was no surprise that Republicans solidly re-took control of the Senate, in a year where the map was stacked toward red states, with a bunch of seats that the Dems probably had no right holding in the first place. But what was shocking was losing governors races in solid-blue, progressive-minded states like Maryland, Massachusetts and Illinois. Indeed, can you name one race where a Democrat exceeded the pre-election expectations, or pulled a true upset? If 2010 was a \"shellacking,\" this was about five or six heavy coats of varnish. I wont rehash my piece from the other day, other than to summarize that disingenuous and often dishonest Republican candidates, a broken system that allows billionaires and their pet corporations to control the message and set the agenda, and voter apathy all went into last nights GOP landslide. You could say -- and President Obama alluded to this today -- that the election was really decided by the two-thirds of American adults that stayed home, or cling to the fact that 37 percent of midterm voters were over age 60 (!). But thats why they play the game -- you have to win with the electorate you have. By any standard, the Democrats and their leader, Obama, were a miserable failure. People have no idea what the Democrats or Obama stand for these days. I sure dont. Part of the problem in politics is that everyone thinks they can turn it around in the next cycle. Thats kind of why the national Democratic Party has been regularly whoring itself out to Wall Street and big business the last couple of decades -- addicts turning political tricks to make it to the next big-money Election Day. Unfortunately, Democratic leaders may not accept the message from last night on just how K-Mart-y their political brand has become. Theyll look at Hillary and a much more favorable Senate map in 2016 and not make fundamental changes. Thats a shame -- because the rock bottom of 2014 would have been the perfect time to start building a Democratic Party that would actually meet the needs of a disillusioned majority. I think about Barry Goldwater, Ronald Reagan, and the presidential election of exactly 50 years ago, in 1964. You want to talk about a shellacking! Goldwater, the Republican nominee who said famously that \"extremism in defense of liberty is no vice,\" got just 38.5 percent of the popular vote, the biggest loss by that measure in American history, to this day. The pundits went wild, suggesting it would take decades for the GOP and its image to recover. Instead, the party went on to win five of the next six presidential elections, four of them by the two chaps pictured with Goldwater at top. The GOP slowly gained an era of dominance by ignoring what most of the pundits told it to do, which was to move toward the center-left and be more like the dominant Democrats of the Kennedy-LBJ era. Instead, the party, especially in the slow rise of Reagan, made its message more conservative, but also simpler. They created a conservative brand that stood for something, with a simple creed. They spent years building a network of think tanks and right-wing media (the modern Democrats have mimicked this, of course, but funding them from Wall Street and rich folks has arguably diluted their brand, not strengthened it.), It helped to have a Great Communicator in Ronald Reagan, who made the transition from Hollywood to national politics by speaking out for Goldwater in that 64 race. Everyone knew what Reagan stood for: Lower taxes, less government, and an unrepentant Cold Warrior -- even if his actual policies in the White House were sometimes the exact opposite. But what if the 2014 debacle inspired the Democrats to develop a brand that addressed the needs of todays voter -- and they backed it up?, The one thing that I think everyone can agree on -- liberal, conservative, or centrist -- is that voters are angry, and with good reason. The American Dream seems farther from most peoples grasp than at any time since the Great Depression. Wages for a middle-class worker have been flat for decades, while 95 percent of income gains in the last five years have gone to the top 1 Percent -- the kleptocrats. The vast middle class -- not just blue-collar workers but white-collar professional-types -- see their adult life divided into two phases, trying to save for their kids astronomical college tuition, and then working until their 70s or 80s because their pension account was robbed blind. These are the kind of problems that voters want fixed -- but they are of no interest to the millionaires and billionaires who fund both parties. In 2014, the Democrats flubbed a giant opportunity to follow through on their plan to make a higher minimum wage a centerpiece of the campaign; while the partys candidates were losing right and left, voters in five states -- some of them deep Republican red -- voted for a higher minimum wage. Showing that they take the problems of the working poor seriously might begin to do something about those two-thirds of voters who stay home. But to win, of course, theyll also need to do more to address the needs of folks above the minimum wage. That means talking more about education -- runaway college tuition, slumping and underfunded public schools (and not just in the cities) and the need for more vocational training that matches actual jobs. (And speaking of jobs, why did the Democrats stop talking about extending unemployment benefits, when almost every voter has friends or family whove been without work for months or years?) Look at the remarkably simple stance of the only Democrat who ousted a big-deal Republican, Pennsylvania Gov.-elect Tom Wolf. Tax oil-and-gas companies. Fund schools. Pretty basic stuff. Imagine a party that sold itself as the party of knowledge, and that embraced science -- including climate science -- instead of running from it. In both referenda and in exit polls on Tuesday, the exact same voters who established GOP congressional hegemony also endorsed policies from closing the gun-show loophole to stricter regulation of natural gas drilling to sensible immigration reform -- the things that only got lip-service, if that, from the Democrats on the ballot. Its not a matter of moving further to the left, not really. Its just a question of standing up for the forward-looking and mostly progressive platform bullet points that you already have. Because the problem, Democrats, is not with what you believe, but that people dont believe that YOU believe in what you say you believe. In fact, they flat out dont believe you, not right now. And that lost trust isnt something you cant win back overnight. Goldwater, Reagan, and the Republicans didnt get a majority to trust them right away, either. But for the patient, the long-term opportunity is there -- to make it clear that Democrats are the party of opportunity, of fairness, of knowledge and learning, a party that wont quit until the American Dream is restored.

{"Content": "[Poor Lindsey Graham. The moment hes been planning for months -- the South Carolina senators annoucement that hes indeed a candidate to become the 45th president of the United States -- hit the exact same moment as a tsunami named Caitlyn Jenner. I think the cover of Vanity Fair with Jenner is a cultural moment that America will remember for 30, 40 years. The Graham campaign may be forgotten by the 2016 general election, if not sooner. Its just hard to take Graham seriously, even if he is the only one of 19 potential GOP candidates who believes theres a role for humans in rolling back climate change. On foreign policy, the dude still wants to party like its 2003, in his beloved country of orange terror alerts and bad guys hiding in your shrubbery. Graham never met a war he didnt like, and its not clear if he wants to be the next POTUS or commissioner of the Thought Police. He once said famously: \"If Im president of the United States and youre thinking about joining Al Qaeda or ISIL, Im not gonna call a judge. Im gonna call a drone and we will kill you.\" Thats the kind of thing that wont get you to 1600 Pennsylvania Aveneue. but it may net Graham a few votes in Iowa or his home base, the Palmetto State. And that kind of thing is a big problem for the GOP. With a looming vacancy in the Oval Office, theres little incentive for any and all manner of Republicans not to throw his or her hat into the ring. After all, running for president is a kind of fun job if youre on any kind of ego trip -- when you know that a lucrative gig as a lobbyist (look at how much blackmail cash Denny Hastert earned in such a short time) or a Fox News commentator is guaranteed on the other side. The Republicans will have anywhere from a dozen to maybe 19 candidates in the early primaries -- yet none has more than 12-13 percent in the early polls. The best known, best funded candidate, Jeb Bush, is actively disliked by the partys base. Others -- like freshmen senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz -- have small rabid followings that arent going to grow any bigger, while the Mike Huckabees and Rick Santorums are yesterdays news. The only candidate I see with breakout potential is what TV experts used to call \"the least objectonable program,\" a dim bulb named Scott Walker. It seems not only possible but likely that the winners in Iowa and New Hamphire will have less than 20 percent of the vote, and a limited delegate haul. All this raises the specter of the great white whale of American politics that had seemed likely to never surface again -- the brokered convention. Its worth noting that of all the people who want to be president, the second most popular right now -- ahead of Bush, Walker and the rest -- is the democratic socialist, Bernie Sanders. But the 2nd place Democrat doesnt make it to the finals; that honor will go to whoever emerges from the Cirque du GOP. And then what if Hillary Clinton the Democratic nominee stumbles?, Will the fringe candidate who talled 19 percent of the primary votes (or who got picked in a smoke-filled room in Cleveland) of an increasingly fringe party that denies science and that is increasingly out of step with the public on an array of social issues actually take the oath on 1/20/17? Or will the fall 2016 general election be as much of a joke as the Republican primaries are fast becoming?

{"Content": "[The Thursday after an election -- especially an election like the one that took place this week -- is one of the most useless days of the news year. All this talk coming out of Washington about the prospects for cooperation and compromise, all the pundit bloviating about how Senate Republicans or President Obama are going to have to show the voters that they can make deals and get things done!!! Its mostly baloney -- in fact, its probably all baloney. Yeah, I guess theres some chance of some deal-making on some of the only things left that America does well -- cutting corporate taxes, making trade deals that will screw over the few blue-collar jobs that we have left, or ratifying another one of our frequent wars. Its possible that Democrats and Republicans can agree that they oppose Ebola, although theres no guarantee on that. But heres what I think is most likely that Congress will vote on sometime during 2015 (after they \"repeal\" Obamacare for the 257th time):, The impeachment of President Barack Obama. Its far too late for this political Titanic to make that U-turn. The trigger, of course, is immigration. You may recall that earlier this year, Obama pledged that -- with comprehensive immigration reform hopelessly stalled in Congress -- he would take unilateral executive action. The moves that hes reportedly considering:, Obama said that without legislation from Congress, he would take steps  to increase border security, upgrade the processing of border crossers  and encourage legal immigration. He also said he would offer immigrants  who have been illegally in the United States for some time a way to  become legal residents, pay taxes, pay a fine and learn English. The moves could mean legal status for several million undocumented immigrants. Can he do that? Legally, its murky at best. But we all know that a president can find a lawyer who can write a memo declaring anything legal, from torture (remember war-crime-enabler John Yoo?) to targeted assassination of U.S. citizens. The bigger question: Can he do this politically?, Look, the conventional view -- which, unlike a lot of the \"conventional views\" that you hear on TV, has some validity -- is that impeachment would be a disaster for America, a Constitutional clash to be avoided at all costs. In the real world, its more complicated. Obamas bind is this: He energized Latino activists and many rank-and-file voters when he pledged aggressive action on the immigration front earlier this year. Then, the embattled Senate Democrats in red states like Arkansas and Louisiana begged him to stop. What happened next? All those Democrats lost -- and one of the things that hurt the party on Tuesday was a lower-than-hoped for Hispanic turnout, and the fact that more of those who did vote voted Republican. Now, if Obama breaks his promise to Latino voters, the political damage to his Democratic Party, and whoever might seek the nomination to replace him in 2016, will be enormous. It was these emerging voters who delivered the presidency to Obama in 2008 and again in 2012, and anything that that sours this voting bloc will destroy the grand scheme for Democratic hegemony throughout the 21st Century. In other words, the choice between alienating his best friends and angering his worst enemies may not be much of a choice. Even though the contemplated executive order may increase his odds of impeachment, he may see that road as his only real option. Both parties have almost certainly come to believe that success -- both recent and especially in 2016 -- depends on NOT compromising. For Team Obama, the calculation probably goes beyond Latinos. Do you remember how black voters rallied behind Bill Clinton in 1998, when the so-called \"first black president\" was impeached. At a time when some African-American voters are understandably disappointed in the Obama presidency, imagine the lightning-bolt impact of impeachment of the ACTUAL first black president. The same for white liberals (or, as theyre calling in the Attytood comments section, \"aging hippies\"). But what about the Republicans? Most of them go back to their gerrymandered, blood-red, mostly white suburban or rural districts -- where the first question from voters, invariably, is \"When are you going to impeach Obama?\" So how do you think most will react when Obama waves a red flag in front of them?, So, yeah, this thing is happening. Personally, Id like to see Americas immigration mess straightened out somehow -- but not like this. I think -- and this was true in 1998, but its more true today -- that when our political leaders play around with something as serious as impeachment, they are playing with fire. Perhaps literally -- because I think the social fabric of America is more dangerously frayed than any time since the 1960s. In Ferguson and in Greater St. Louis, public officials -- when not thinking up new ways to shield the facts on the killing of Mike Brown from the public and the media -- have spent tens of thousands of dollars on riot gear for the day when Officer Darren Wilson is inevitably cleared of any murder charges. But social unrest doesnt happen in a vacuum. In Americas urban areas, a lot of things are already weighing on peoples minds, from police brutality to closing their neighborhood schools to efforts to impede their voting rights.

{"Content": "[And now were watching as Congress passes yet another provision that was written by lobbyists for the biggest recipient of bailout money in the history of this country. And its attached to a bill that needs to pass or else we entire federal government will grind to a halt. Think about that kind of power. If a financial institution has become so big and so powerful that it can hold the entire country hostage. That alone is reason enough to break them up. Enough is enough. -- U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D.-Mass.) speech on U.S. Senate floor, Dec. 12, 2014. Do you remember voting for Jamie Dimon of J.P. Morgan Chase, and the Citigroup Party, back in the November election? Me neither. Remember, this was the election about nothing --- the GOP platform was \"You dont like Obama and neither do we,\" while the Democrats thoughtfully countered with, \"Derp!\" This was pretty obvious at the time, but both parties were clearly terrified that a real discussion of the issues might have screwed up their real mission. Which is doing anything that Citigroup, Jamie Dimon, and the Wall Street bigwigs who paid for their campaigns ask them to do. This weekends stunning action in Washington -- in which the American government was allowed to keep running, as long as representatives caved into the demands of Wall Street and the billionaire political donor class -- made two things clear. 1) Almost no one in Washington (except for the above-mentioned Elizabeth Warren and a hearty band of outgunned rebels) is even bothering to make a pretense of standing up for the common citizen anymore and 2) there is depressingly little, in the near term, that average folks can do about it. (Note: Among the sell-outs were Philadelphia Democrats Bob Brady, Chaka Fattah, and Allyson Schwartz...so much for the myth of \"liberal Philly.\"), The most offensive thing is the cynical way that Big Money and its bought-and-paid-for-Congress abused notions of \"bipartisanship\" and \"compromise\" -- the things that the average, fairly disengaged voter are said to desire -- to sneak through a measure that aids The One Percent at the expense of the 99 Percent. Thats the only kind of \"bipartisanship\" that Democrats and Republicans inside the Beltway are truly down with. The measure rolls back some of the necessary financial protections that were passed in the so-called Dodd-Frank bill, after Wall Streets risky practices crashed a big chunk of the global economy in 2008. Now -- in a measure written by Citibank lobbyists -- taxpayer money is again backing the financial industrys swaps and other dangerous derivative instruments. And the lobbyists made sure it was attached to the $1.1 trillion fund-the-government bill, the so-called \"CRomnibus.\", Heres Matt Taibbi, the great chronicler of 21st Century Wall Street shenanigans:, As Warren has cannily pointed out,  veterans of Citigroup have dominated the Democratic Party establishment  for quite a long time now, through figures like current Treasury  Secretary Jack Lew and former Clinton Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin. Conservatives for welfare, and liberals for big business. It doesnt  make sense unless were not really dealing with any divided collection  of conservatives or liberals, and are instead talking about one  nebulous mass of influence, money and interests. I think of it as a  single furiously-money-collecting/favor-churning oligarchical Beltway  party, a thing that former Senate staffer and author Jeff Connaughton  calls \"The Blob.\", So this was a compromise? Look, the golden era of Congress was never that golden, but there was a time 50 or so years ago, when a Democratic president would seek $100 million for a program, fiscally conservatives Republicans would counter with $50 million, and in the end it would get $75 million. That was \"compromise\" and \"bipartisanship.\" What happened this weekend was something completely different: \"Blackmail\" by rich donors -- exactly what we have feared after Citizens United and other court decisions allowed unlimited money to infect the body politic. What can be done...realistically? Im honestly not sure. Flipping Congress from Republican to Democratic and back to the GOP has proved easy in the 21st Century, but electing a Congress that truly represents citizens, in a time of Citizens United and computer-aided gerrymandering, has proved damn near impossible. The White House in 2016? Hillary Clinton is a unrepentant tool of Wall Street, and the odds of Warren or another more liberal candidate beating her in the primaries and then surviving the Fox News onslaught in the general election are very, very long. Jeb Bush, Mitt Romney and the other looming Republican retreads are even worse. As we were just saying last week...no wonder thousands of people are in the street protesting. To be sure, the mass demonstrations are focused mostly on police violence right now, but it wouldnt surprise me if the emphasis soon gets bigger. Maybe the next march and rally can pay a visit to the Citigroup headquarters with this message for Wall Street: Hands up, dont loot...the U.S. Treasury!, Bloggers note: Speaking of fiscal policy, Ill be on unpaid furlough for the rest of the week.

{"Content": "[President Obama has been talking a lot these days about \"middle class economics,\" and his poll numbers have been rising, so this time he must be doing something right. You dont really need a Ph.D. in running focus groups to see that the average American worker still isnt happen with the current state of our economy -- with real incomes soaring for the top 1 Percent and stagnant or even falling for the 99 Percent, and with a job market thats still kind of dodgy, especially for under-employed mid-career workers. But theres only so much that lame duck Obama can accomplish, especially with a Republican Congress, so any hope for real change seems pinned to the 2016 election. Good luck with that. So far, incredibly, its the Republicans whove been talking the talk about helping the middle class in 2016 -- none more so than Jeb Bush, perceived by the pundit class as an early frontrunner. \"Today, Americans across the country are frustrated,\" the ex-Florida governor said recently in Detroit, Ground Zero of the blue-collar implosion. \"They see only a  small portion of the population riding the economys up escalator.\", But Bush 3 has yet to offer any policies ideas beyond more of the same stuff from the GOP blueprint that actually built this escalator, back in the era of the Reagan Revolution. And theres nothing in Bushs background -- which includes stints with Lehmann Brothers and Barclays Capital -- that suggests he will truly betray his class. The most intriguing Republican rival to Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, started out by alienating a huge swath of the working class; now he thinks he can get blue-collar votes by trashing his states great public university and seeking to reduce it to a trade school..not what the actual middle class actually wants. What an opportunity for the Democrats...who are totally blowing it (shocking, I know :-) ) Thats because the party is on a Titanic-like irreversible course to nominate the She-Wolf of Wall Street, Hillary Clinton. Ever since her husband lifted the last remaining chains on the financial sector during the dot-com bubble of the 1990s (a move that blew up in the 2008 crisis, with no repercussions for the Clintons or anyone else involved), Hillary has basked in both adulation and campaign cash -- mainly the cash -- from the towers of lower Manhattan. No wonder that Wall Streeters were crowing to the New York Post today that they cant lose in 2016. But now that Clinton and her aides can see the crowd with pitchforks gathering underneath her windows, she needs an escape plan. She does not have one. The New York Times reported her quandry today: \"With advice from more than 200 policy experts, Hillary Rodham Clinton is  trying to answer what has emerged as a central question of her early  presidential campaign strategy: how to address the anger about income  inequality without overly vilifying the wealthy.\", In typical fashion, this is all about framing the issue, rather than attacking it. But while improving the economy isnt completely a zero-sum game, it is, at heart, an omelet that requires breaking a few eggs, and maybe hurting some billionaire feelings in the process. Most average voters have a sense of what progress would look like: A return to somewhat higher taxes on the wealthy -- closer to the 50 percent top marginal rate when they thrived in the mid-1980s under Reagan -- as well as an end to the ridiculous low-tax loophole for hedge-fund millionaires and billionaires, and real penalties for firms that move jobs overseas. The revenues could implement Obamas plan for free community college, build new roads and a more efficient electric grid, and fund early childhood education. That would benefit not just the working class but ultimately corporations and their wealthy CEOs, because it would mean folks could actually afford to buy their products. Of course, common sense policies like that might hurt some rich dudes ego, amid the usual squeals of \"class warfare.\" News flash: Theres been a class war in America for 35 years, and it was launched by one class, the upper one, which bought its favored politicians and rigged the tax codes while distracting you with a trumped-up \"culture war.\" Now, the peoples side doesnt have a general, not a Washington general (heh) anyway -- but there is much that can be done in statehouses and City Halls, to raise the minimum wage and expand health care and sick leave.

{"Content": "[This summer, we got a hard lesson in how easy it is to fool the American people -- a sizable chunk of them, anyway -- as well as the media. Especially the media. A leader with almost no experience at the level at which hes competing promised that he would deliver a return to greatness, and people believed him. None of his bizarre moves or pronouncements were questioned by his adoring supporters or by the journalists who were supposed to be subjecting him to intense scrutiny. There were even headlines in the paper that by the time it really counted in February, he could go all the way. Now, people are kicking themselves. How could we all have been duped by such skillful marketing...and by a huckster and a fraud?, But enough about Chip Kelly and the Eagles. Im here today to talk again about the sorry state of the 2016 presidential race. Although were still in the first quarter of that game, things are looking about as bleak for the American voters as they did yesterday for the boys in green. The idea of real talk about policies that might help the beleaguered U.S. middle class is getting pushed back like DeMarco Murray on a 1st-down hand-off. The Republican Party had its second presidential debate at the Reagan Library in California last week, and it was a disgraceful affair on several levels. One of the problems was only partially the fault of the candidates. There was shockingly little talk about the kind of things that regular people care about, the stuff they ask politicians when they get to pose the questions. Like how come we never get a pay raise? How will I ever afford to send my kids to college? Or get time off to care for a sick family member?, Some of the blame obviously belongs with CNN, which was asking the questions. \"Anything can happen tonight!\" the networks Jake Tapper declared breathlessly at the outset, which sounded more like the lead-in to -- stop me if youve heard this one before -- a reality show than to an enlightened discussion. And it wasnt particular enlightening -- unless you care more about the Planned Parenthood flap (mentioned 23 times) or the Middle East (10 mentions) than, as George W. Bush once famously said, \"putting food on your family.\" (The middle class was only mentioned 4 times.), Of course, the people vying to become the leader of the so-called free world could have used their awesome leadership powers to steer the conversation toward The Things That Really Matter, but they didnt. Some of the candidates were too busy...whats a polite word for this?...lying. Take Carly Fiorina. She scored a lot of points at the debate with an impassioned plea to America to see what see saw in those undercover Planned Parenthood videos. Too bad the scene she described doesnt exist. She also provided a fictitious account of her disastrous tenure as CEO of Hewlett Packard, and either lied or displayed ignorance about who killed immigration reform and U.S. military exercises in the Baltic. Did I mention that most GOP watchers think that Fiorina won the debate, and that should could become the party front-runner if Chip Kelly Donald Trump falters?, Or course, there was also Trump spreading dangerous false information about vaccinations and Gov. Chris Christie, who once was actually concerned about man-made climate change, now calling global warming \"a wild, left-wing idea.\", Did I mention the debate was a disgrace?, Which provided a huge opening -- the kind that DeMarco Murray hasnt seen since 2014 -- for the Democrats to knock Americas socks off by contrasting their ideas and explaining what theyd do for the forgotten middle class at their debate, which...what, what?!!!, True story -- the Democrats, with a healthy field of five candidates and possibly a sixth if Vice President Hamlet ever enters the race, havent held a debate yet, even as the Republicans have held two which have been seen by record numbers of would-be voters. In fact, the first Democratic debate (which will be held in Las Vegas..dont even say it) isnt until nearly the middle of next month. And if everything holds to plan, the GOP field will ultimately debate about twice as much as Hillary, Bernie, and The Rest. Thats an embarrassment to the party of Jefferson, Jackson FDR and JFK. This weekend at a New Hampshire Democratic Party confab, the partys national chair, Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, was confronted as she tried to speak by protesters from the crowd demanding that the party stage more debates. Her mostly non-sequitur of a response?, \"Whats more important, drawing a contrast with Republicans, or arguing about debates?\" she asked. \"Lets focus on our mission at hand. Lets focus on our task at hand.\", She added: \"You know better than anyone that this race cant be won from a stage or through a television screen. You want to see these candidates in your living rooms, in coffee shops, and at forums just like the one were having here today.\", First of all, what better place than debates seen by millions of people to draw a contrast with the Republicans? Second of all, the many of us who dont live in New Hampshire -- where you cant get a cup of Joe without getting harassed by some second-tier candidate -- but in late-primary states (or \"loser states,\" in Trump parlance) like Pennsylvania would like to hear more from these guys. More Democratic debates would answer a lot of things that voters arent seeing addressed. Some of them are probably a little horse-racy: Is Sanders mainstream enough? Is Clinton a cyborg? Does Martin OMalley even exist? But wed also see what a different political party has to say about things like college tuition or climate change that Republicans are either ignoring or dismissing. You dont need a tin-foil hat to sense a conspiracy theory here, that Wasserman-Schultz & Co. are running out the clock on behalf of Establishment choice and national front-runner Clinton, that too many debates would give Democrats the crazy idea that there are actual alternatives. But even if Clinton is the nominee -- and shes certainly still a heavy favorite -- the lack of debates is hurting her, especially among the small batch of undecided voters who heard about this e-mail thingee and wonder if the former secretary of state has something to hide.

Democratic National Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz derided the 17 announced and potential GOP presidential candidates here for a state-party summit Friday and Saturday as a clown car of extremism crammed with peddlers of discredited policies. She said they all, to one degree or another support trickle-down economics approaches, cutting taxes for the wealthy, that have failed to spur economic growth and contributed to the crash of 2008. In addition, the Republicans stand against gay rights, legislation mandating equal pay for women, and abortion rights. They might as well be one person, said Ray Buckley, chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party. But doesnt the crowded GOP field testify to a vitality that contrasts with the Democrats, where Hillary Clinton faces no serious opposition for the nomination. We dont have a presumptive nominee, Wasserman Schultz said. Lets just be clear. We will have a primary, and I expect it to be competitive, so we will have a discussion of ideas on our side of the aisle as well. She cited her GOP counterpart Reince Priebus, who has done his best to avoid overexposure of intraparty fighting by, among other things, limiting authorized TV debates. Hes shrunk the debates down to nine, simply so they dont have their wackadoodles out there disturbing votersthat hurt them in the general election. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has banked heavily on New Hampshire, spending more time here this week than any of the other hopefuls. He proposed cuts in federal entitlements, campaigned hard at diners and pizza shops and held a free-wheeling town hall meeting. Im not sure theres anything Chris Christie can say to re-establish himself as a credible candidate for president, Buckley said in an interview. Christies strategists rely on his superior skills in the town-hall format, pointing to how Arizona Sen. John McCain revived his left-for-dead campaign by taking on all questions in dozens of VFW halls and community centers across New Hampshire, rounding up anyone who would listen. Theyre all going to be doing to be town halls, Buckley said. Theres nothing so unique to Chris Christie that others cant match or do better, Buckley said. But the bigger problem, in his view, is the anemic economy and fiscal trouble sin New Jersey itself. When youre running for president, Republican or Democrat, as a governor or former governor, youre really running on that record, Buckley said, and Christie has nothing to point to. Holding the opposite view is Drew Cline, influential editor of the conservative editorial page of the Manchester Union-Leader. He says that the state, with its more varied primary electorate than in Iowas caucuses, is tailor-made for a candidate with Christies extraordinary retail gifts.

{"Content": "[Mike Parrish, a Malvern businessman and former Army aviator, on Tuesday said he is seeking the 2016 Democratic nomination for U.S. House in the Sixth District, citing a fundamental lack of leadership in Washington. Folks in Congress are focusing on their own personal interest and putting politics over the peoples business, Parrish said in an interview. Im not a career politician. I have a fresh perspective. In 2014, Parrish launched a campaign for the Chester County-based seat, but stepped aside in favor of physician Manan Trivedi, who had been the Democratic nominee twice before. Republican Ryan Costello, former chairman of the Chester County commissioners, won and is in his first term. The seat was held for six terms by former Rep. Jim Gerlach (R.,Pa.), who had decided not to seek reelection. The district also includes portions of Montgomery, Berks and Lebanon counties. Parrish, 51, said he wants to focus on making college more affordable; science, math and engineering education; and small business growth. He also is focused on the Veterans Administration, struggling with management problems. Whats going on is a travesty, Parrish said. He graduated from West Point in 1985 and spent 14 years in the Army as a helicopter pilot and operations officer, and is a veteran of the first Persian Gulf War. He also has a masters degree in aeronautical engineering from Stanford, and an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. In civilian life, Parrish has been chief executive officer of several companies, and founded an environmental services firm before selling it. He also worked for General Electric. Democrats see a chance to dislodge the freshman Costello before he gets entrenched as an incumbent, hoping that the higher turnout of a presidential election will help in a district that leans Republican. Parrish is the first Democrat to announce for the seat, and the partys campaign committee likes his profile. If there is a Democratic primary, he could have to explain an issue that came up last year: Parrish was a Republican until he changed his registration in December 2013, and he has contributed money to former Gov. Tom Corbett in 2010, John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012. \"Im very much a centrist moderate, and I realize the Republican Party is going farther to the right,\" he told The Inquirer last year. \"Its no longer reflecting my values.\", He called himself an environmentalist and said he respects womens rights, adding that the Democratic Party \"is much more embracing to those ideas.\", A primary seems possible.

Rick Santorum brought his presidential campaign home Friday, telling a roomful of Republican activists in Philadelphia that the party needs to focus on winning blue collar voters in order to take back the White House.

In 2012, Santorum won the Iowa caucus and wound up finishing second to Mitt Romney in the GOP nomination contest. Theres a lot of talk about why we lost the last election: the evangelical vote didnt come out, or this voter didnt come out, Santorum said. But if you look at the subsequent analysis in the years after 2012, and you know what they found out, particularly in the northeastern United States? The blue collar voters didnt turn out. He argued that President Obama and the Democrats did not have appeal to the working class, and Republicans, with Romney as the nominee, were easily typecast as caring only about the wealthy. Theyre killing all the manufacturing with their crazy environmental policies, Santorum said of Democrats. To make things worse for blue collar workers, he said, We brought 35 million legal and illegal immigrants, almost all of them unskilled, into this country to flatten out wages.

Santarsiero will be aiming to replace U.S. Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick (R. Pa.), who has announced that he wont seek re-election to the eighth district seat. Fitzpatrick holds a competitive seat, set almost entirely in Bucks, that has swung back and forth between Republican and Democratic control. Notably, Santarsieros announcement included an endorsement from the local party chairman, something neither Democratic challenger could secure last year in a competitive primary. Democrats wound up nominating Kevin Strouse, a political rookie who had never lived in Bucks and was picked to run by national Democrats, instead of locals. He struggled to win the primary and was trounced in the general election. Im excited to start preparing a campaign to represent the people of Bucks and Montgomery Counties in Congress, Santarsiero, 49, said in a news release. Its time we make Washington accountable to our citizens. I will make it a priority to focus on keeping the middle class families of the 8thDistrict secure whilehelping to grow our economy, create jobs and bring real reform to Washington. His announcement came less than 48 hours after Santarsiero began a new term in Harrisburg and a new Congress was seated in Washington. A former lawyer, teacher and Lower Makefield township supervisor, he first won his statehouse seat in 2008. Steve can win this seat. He just won re-election to the statehouse by a landslide in a swing district in what turned out to be a very bad year for Democrats, John Cordisco, chairman of the Bucks County Democrats, said in the release. He has a clear track record of winning in a tough district, and thats what we will need to prevail in the 2016 congressional race. The announcement also included praise from former U.S. Rep. Allyson Schwartz (D. Pa.), of Montgomery County. She called his plans great news for the 8th district and for our Democratic Party. Santasiero, the release noted, has lived in Bucks County for 19 years. Shaughnessy Naughton, who ran against Strouse in the 2014 Democratic primary, has shown signs of interest in another run.

{"Content": "[WASHINGTON  President Obama, Vice President Biden, Gov. Wolf and Mayor Nutter will be among the guests speaking to fellow Democrats in Philadelphia this week as House Democrats hold a policy retreat in the city. Member of the House Democratic caucus will be making their way to the Sheraton in Society Hill Wednesday afternoon as they meet to develop a policy and political strategy for the next two years amid diminished numbers in Congress. They will be greeted by speeches from Nutter and Wolf  whose win was one of Democrats few bright spots on Election Day. The meetings come as House Democrats try to build a new message that can better connect with voters over the next two years and leading up to the 2016 elections. Its a chance for the caucus to organize its policy focus said U.S. Rep. Chaka Fattah (D. Pa.), of Philadelphia. Its kind of like a huddle before the football game. Well have an opportunity coming out of there not only united, but knowing that we want to follow in the footsteps of the president here in really focusing on middle class economics, said Xavier Becerra (D. Calif.), chairman of the House Democratic caucus. The focus will be on the economy and how we try to make sure that all the fruits that have come over the last several years from a growing economy actually make it to the middle class. For some lawmakers, it will also simply be a chance to get to know some of the new members who only joined Congress in January. Obama will speak to the caucus Thursday and Biden Friday. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka will also address the group. The meetings and most of the speeches will be closed to the press and public. The retreat, held at the start of every new Congress, is usually held in a rural setting somewhere near Washington, though several Democrats said there had been requests in recent years for a city setting. Philadelphia, Becerra said, is close enough to Washington that its easy for lawmakers to get to, but far enough away that it hopefully removes the day-to-day distractions of Capitol Hill. Becerra said Nutter made it very clear that they would do everything possible to help up us make it a good experience in Philadelphia. Fattah said he was helping colleagues with advice about restaurants and places to visit, and Becerra said he hoped lawmakers have time to visit some of the citys historic sites. He said he had hoped to hold meetings at Independence Hall, but it was too small to accommodate the caucus. Republicans also came to Pennsylvania for their policy retreat.

{"Content": "[WASHINGTON  After months of ads and attacks, we finally got results Tuesday. What do they mean and whats next?, As the last embers of Election Day die out, here are some thoughts on the future for Sen. Pat Toomey and Republicans and Hillary Clinton and Democrats, the failings of national Democrats House campaigns, Bucks County upstart Kevin Strouse, a secret weapon for the winning campaigns and the sad, scripted nature of campaigns. In no particular order , Whats Next Part I: Toomey/RepublicansIf the local races this year turned into sleepers, 2016 holds promise for more drama. Pat Toomey will be a top target as he runs in a state that now regularly goes to Democrats in presidential election years. The attention we saw on red-state Democrats like Mark Pryor, Mary Landrieu and Mark Udall? Expect a similar crush in Pennsylvania. But while thats a long way away, Republicans can set the tone for that race in the next six months or so, the approximate window for legislating before attention and agendas turn to the next campaign. The GOP has a choice: now that theyve got control of Congress, what do they do with it? Do they push through the bold conservative ideas many have advocated, and dare the president to veto? Or do they find some modest areas of agreement, pass some bills Obama will sign, and show that they can govern better than Dems did when they held the Senate?, The outcome could have a ripple effect on Toomey. Pass some laws, and he can bolster his argument to critical swing voters that hes a pragmatic conservative, looking to get things done. But if the right wing pushes confrontation, Toomey may be forced into votes that add to Democrats argument that hes too conservative for a purpl(ish) state trending blue. A related question that breaks down along the same lines: who wins the GOP presidential nomination, placing his or her name directly above Toomeys on the 2016 ballot?, In recent interviews several Pennsylvania Republicans warned that Toomeys re-election gets a lot tougher if the GOP picks a candidate who turns off suburban moderates critical to winning statewide. If the nominee is, say, Ted Cruz or Rick Perry, its easy to imagine the attacks tying Toomey to the candidate and calling them both too EXTREME for Pennsylvania. (Read in your most ominous voice). I havent asked him about it, but you have to imagine Toomey might like the idea of a Christie candidacy, linking him instead to a blue state Republican just across the river. Whats Next Part II: Hillary/DemocratsDemocrats, of course, have their own big question: who takes on Toomey?, The senator is well-liked personally and has no glaring black marks against him so far. So unlike Tom Wolf vs. Tom Corbett, it wont be enough for the Democrat to simply not be Toomey. He or she will have to be a truly attractive alternative to the incumbent. But Sestak rubs some insiders the wrong way. They complain that hes not a team player, citing his decision to run against Arlen Specter in 2010, when many wanted to rally behind the ex-Republican. Others were upset when Sestak passed on the 2012 Congressional race when Democrats thought they had a shot to unseat then first-term Congressman Pat Meehan. And Sestak already has a statewide loss on his resume. Then again, Toomey also lost once (in the 2004 GOP primary) before coming back to win six years later. And even if some Democrats gripe, Sestak ran against the establishment in the 2010 primary and came out on top. He might not need them very much. The election is still two years away, but if anyone wants to stop Sestak theyll need to start making the case for themselves fast. Much as the GOP presidential nominee might affect Toomey, so will the quality of the Democratic contender. Everyone assumes thatll be Hillary Clinton, and that shell win big in Pennsylvania and make life hard on Toomey. But what we havent heard yet is why she should be president, other than that she can. Consider how Bill Clinton arrived as a new type of Democrat to oust a president who had been at the White House for 12 years as VP and then POTUS. Or how George W. Bush, as a compassionate conservative, beat an opponent who had spent eight years on Pennsylvania Avenue. Or how Barack Obama topped the septuagenarian John McCain and then the 1950s throwback Mitt Romney. This year, Republicans have the fresh faces and (relatively) youthful energy in the likes of Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Scott Walker. Clinton needs to use the next two years to define a vision for the future if shes going to win and really provide the coattails Democrats are counting on in Pennsylvania. DCCC DisconnectSenate Democrats took the biggest hit Tuesday, losing their majority and nearly every close race in the country. But in the Philadelphia area it was the House Dems who were the biggest losers. They targeted three Republican-held districts in our area, but the national Democratic operation seemed to have no connection to local activists or operatives, and pushed a flat message that sucked individuality out of their candidates. It showed in three potential swing districts in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, where Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee candidates all flopped. It was always going to be an uphill fight this year, but the Democratic picks didnt even make a game of it. Prodded by Washington operatives, local Democrats ran insipid, cookie-cutter campaigns, coming off as robotic. Press 1 for jobs and the economy. Press 2 for minimum wage and college tuition. Press 3 for same-sex marriage and abortion. For any other questions, please call back at another time. (To be fair, GOP candidates could seem similarly scripted, but they had the upper hand to start with - the status quo favored them. More on this later). In Jon Runyans South Jersey district  where the incumbent didnt run, opening up a route to a district that could be within Democrats reach -- Burlington County freeholder Aimee Belgard was staffed up by national operatives with few ties to the area, and put in bubble wrap (as PolitickerNJ neatly put it). While she said little, the DCCC bombed her opponent, Tom MacArthur, with attack ads that made big claims based on a thin set of facts. It made for a bad contrast. Meanwhile, MacArthur was guided by local consultants who have long won elections in South Jersey. The vaunted Camden County Democratic machine, arguably the most powerful force in Jersey politics, focused not on Belgard but on helping state Sen. Donald Norcross win a neighboring district. The result: an easy MacArthur win and a missed opportunity for Democrats. Democrats had another opening in the Chester-based Pennsylvania 6th, where incumbent Jim Gerlach decided not to run. The DCCC hand-picked a candidate, Mike Parrish. But here again, they didnt have local backing. Manan Trivedi did. So even though national Democrats didnt want to back a candidate who had already lost twice, he easily pushed Parrish out. My advice to any Democrat thinking of running for Congress: Dont factor support from the DCCC into your campaign plan, Berringer said. You have to run your own race based on your district and your own authenticity. If you do it right, the party support will come. Bucks BeatdownDemocrats faced the same local disconnect in the Bucks-based eighth district. There, they faced a battle-tested GOP incumbent, Mike Fitzpatrick, but had what the DCCC thought was a star recruit: former Army Ranger Kevin Strouse. He was even featured as the lead anecdote in a Washington Post story highlighting House Democrats strategy for the year. That became evident in the primary, when he barely beat local businesswoman Shaughnessy Naughton, despite Strouses DCCC backing and a huge money edge. (One Republicans theory: knowing that Fitzpatrick is planning to retire after this term, no Dems one with ambition wanted to get behind an outsider who might block the route to an open seat in 2016.), If Strouse wants to be in the mix again that year, he did himself no favors. He acknowledged to my colleague Chris Palmer that he didnt raise enough money, though he didnt rule out running again. To do that, though, hell have to explain a dismal 38 percent showing. Mighty MailWinning candidates might want to leave a nice holiday tip for their mailmen. While we all focus on the polls on Election Day, campaigns are turning their attention to mail-in ballots well before most voters head to polling places. Its an easy way to reach voters you know are supportive, and to make sure they vote without having to send people knocking on their doors at the last minute. A South Jersey insider told me this week that almost 18% of ballots in Camden County were cast by mail  a place where Democrats made an effort to encourage that kind of voting. (You can vote by mail for any reason in NJ). The state Democratic party also made a big vote-by-mail push in the Belgard-MacArthur race, sending out pre-filled application forms to likely Democratic voters. (Those ballots were challenged by the GOP, but ultimately allowed.), In Pennsylvania, Fitzpatrick sent an e-mail blast to supporters urging them to vote absentee  drawing criticism from Strouse but no formal challenge. And in late October an aide to Ryan Costello, who won the Chester County-based sixth district, told me he knew things were going well when he saw that absentee ballots were coming in overwhelmingly in favor of the GOP. When it comes to turnout, the mail box is looking like a powerful tool. UnscriptedMy two favorite interviews of election season came from an unexpected place: Philadelphia Republicans with virtually no chance to win. Unlike most candidates, they sounded like real human beings. Ask them any question and they answered in a straight-forward way that let you know where they actually stood. Some of it was even colorful and fun. When James told me why he wanted to approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline, he said energy independence would shut Putin up. And he called on Philadelphia voters to hold public officials accountable with the same passion they used to hold Andy Reid accountable after every Eagles loss. Some of it may have been bad politics in heavily-Democratic districts. (James said he favored Voter ID laws  hated by many Democrats -- because if youre a man and youre 30 and you dont have ID, I dont want you voting.). Some of it showed where honesty meets inexperience. (Rath volunteered how she had to return one campaign check after the donors found out she is pro-choice). And some of it would have been devastating if these races were competitive. (James, who has visited Tehran, assured me that Iranians love America and that the tension between the countries is just media hype). But as they ran two of the most uphill campaigns in America, the two Republicans still seemed to represent so much of what is both great and ill in our democracy. On one hand, it was encouraging to see a 33-year-old high school teacher (James), and a 34-year-old medical sales consultant (Rath) able to campaign and argue and raise up their voices as loudly as they could manage, even against two longtime incumbents. On the other hand, hearing the two ramble through their ideas, go against party dogma and stray into mistakes was a stark reminder of how scripted, professionalized and sanitized so much of our politics are. When a straight answer on the first try is reason to celebrate, it tells us about the quality of dialogue most candidates offer the public. Professional political advisers paid to read the polls and script answers and win races  say they have good reasons for what they do. Most regular people are busy and have a limited bandwidth for politics. So when candidates have 30 seconds to woo a voter, their pitches better be precise and they better be sharp and they better be focused on the issues voters care about most. If James and Rath were in tighter districts, they might have had more money and more staff and more of that type of advice, and the traits that made them distinct would probably be professionally sanded off, leaving only those attributes poll-tested to convey authenticity. Which would be too bad.

As we make these investments in our future, the President will propose to end the across-the-board sequester cuts that threaten our economy and our military, a White House official said in advance of the speech.The presidents budget will fully reverse those cuts for domestic priorities, and match those investments dollar-for-dollar with the resources our troops need to keep America safe. The change -- in which the president will call for breaking spending caps laid out by both parties earlier in his term -- will be part of a new budget proposal due out Monday. The president, though, will have a steep climb to get what he wants, since Republicans control Congress. Many in the GOP also want to  end the cuts, particularly to the military, but they would prefer to replace the automatic reductions with more targeted reductions in domestic spending in order to slim down the government. They have balked at Obamas calls for more taxes. The automatic cuts to both domestic and defense spending were put in place by both parties to resolve one of the many recent fiscal crises and have been in effect since 2013.

Obama and fellow Democrats have complained that the sequester cuts are arbitrary and make no distinction between valuable and wasteful programs. Obama believes they have stymied investments that would help average Americans. The White House official said Obamas budget would be paid for with cuts to inefficient programs and by closing tax loopholes. The full details wont be out until Monday, but the official said Obamas plan will invest in manufacturing, rebuilding infrastructure and medical research. Obama, in his State of the Union speech, called for tax increases that would target the wealthy in order to provide tax cuts to the middle class.

{"Content": "[WASHINGTON  Pat Toomey isnt named in the latest Quinnipiac Poll, but the Republican senator probably likes it anyway. The poll, out Tuesday morning, shows Hillary Clintons numbers sinking in Pennsylvania  and that could be a key factor in Toomeys tough 2016 re-election fight. The poll, one of three Quinnipiac released in swing states (Ohio and Florida are the others), shows a sharp drop in Pennsylvanians approval of Clinton, the Democratic front-runner in waiting. Her favorability in Pennsylvania stood at 48-47, according to the poll, down from 55-38 Feb. 3.

He cited the states unemployment rate, which at 6.5 percent remains above the national average, and corporate subsidies that he blasted as wasteful. \"I dont know how you try to run in a United States election where the economy is number one and youve failed so miserably.\", Christie endorsed Lonegan in the 2013 Senate race and raised money for him, but Lonegan said he also got donations from Cruz, and that two other GOP hopefuls -- Sen. Rand Paul (R. Ky.) and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry -- both came to New Jersey to campaign for him as well. At some point, Lonegan said, you have to choose sides. \"You lock and load and get your guy elected,\" Lonegan said. New Jersey rarely plays a big role in presidential nominating contests -- its primary day is among the last in the nation, usually arriving after the nominations have been effectively decided. Lonegan said that with so many GOP candidates this time around, he hopes next year will be different. Lonegan believes Cruz is the first Republican candidate to choose a campaign chair in New Jersey. Steve Lonegan has been a tireless advocate for taxpayers and was one of Americas most fiscally responsible mayors, Cruz said in a news release. He brings a wealth of knowledge in both New Jersey politics and conservative governance to our campaign, and I deeply appreciate his support. While running against Booker in 2013, Lonegan named Cruz as a senator he would model himself after if he won. In the same debate Lonegan also cited Paul and Sen. Marco Rubio (R. Fla.) -- both 2016 contenders -- as senators he admires. America needs a President that understands that only liberty can lead us to prosperity, Lonegan said in Cruzs release. We need a President who will support our Constitution fearlessly and cut the size of government, not just slow down its growth. Senator Cruz not only understands this, but has the record to prove it. He has shown the courage to lead our nation back to greatness in the world. Lonegan has a long history of conservative activism in New Jersey, waging sometimes lonely fights against government borrowing and taxes and taking on social issues like affirmative action and one public schools ban on religious songs at a winter concert. That work and his flair for the dramatic (he once went to Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in Newark on Martin Luther King Day to protest affirmative action) has won Lonegan a faithful conservative following. But in a blue state, his backing has not been enough to win any elections since 2003, when he captured a third term as mayor in Bogota, in North Jersey. His latest campaign was last year, when Lonegan lost in a Republican primary against Rep. Tom MacArthur (R. N.J.) in the race to replace Jon Runyan in a South Jersey Congressional seat. Lonegan also ran for governor in 2005, finishing third in the GOP primary. Despite his losses, Lonegan has insisted that New Jersey is not as liberal as it is often portrayed. In backing Cruz, hell have another chance to try to prove his point.

{"Content": "[WASHINGTON  During the 2013 government shutdown, Allentowns Charlie Dent became something of a national spokesman for the oft-overlooked centrist Republican  a group that arguably includes every GOP Congressman from the Philadelphia suburbs. After the stand-off torpedoed GOP approval ratings, Dent told me that he felt lessons had been learned among Republicans, and that moderate voices would be more ready to flex their muscles going forward. Some of them did just that this week while expressing continued frustration with an agenda advanced by their conferences most conservative and confrontational figures. In a push and pull that peaked Wednesday and Thursday, Republican women and moderates from the northeast forced GOP House leaders to back off of a bill that would bar abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The fight hinged on the bills rape exception  which said women who had been raped could still get an abortion after 20 weeks, but only if they had reported the crime to police. The measure, dubbed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, was intended to make a point on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade and as pro-life activists held a massive rally in Washington. But the rally participants were left disappointed as the bill was pulled. Women in the Republican conference and several Republicans from the northeast, including members of the Philadelphia-areas all male contingent, worried about dragging their party back into an argument over rape  a topic that has led to embarrassing moments for their party. \"I prefer that we avoid these very contentious social issues,\" Dent told DC reporters. \"Week one, we had a speaker election that did not go as well as a lot of us would have liked. Week two, we got into a big fight over deporting children, something that a lot of us didnt want to have a discussion about. Week three, we are now talking about rape and incest and reportable rapes and incest for minors.  I just cant wait for week four.\", (He was referring to a failed conservative coup against Speaker John Boehner and then a vote to end deportation exceptions for dreamers  undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as young children who have grown up here. Dent and other local Republicans broke with their party to oppose the move to end those protections). On the abortion bill, U.S. Rep. Pat Meehan (R. Pa.) told the Washington Post he worried about making rape victims come forward and relive the issue through having to further testify. I wanted that to be considered in everybodys thinking. The differences go well beyond the one clause in this one bill. Its about a far bigger divide within the GOP over tone and approach. On tone, Philadelphia-area Republicans, like Meehan, of Delaware County, Dent and others represent moderate districts and have repeatedly argued for a less confrontational posture. They still criticize the president and favor most of the things youd expect a Republican would  lower taxes, less regulation, building Keystone XL, curbing Obamacare  but they are more amenable to cutting deals and taking incremental progress, rather than passing hard-line bills that make bolder statements, but have no chance to become law. (Even though the GOP controls both chambers of Congress, Democrats in the Senate can still use the filibuster to block any measures -- unless the plans are appealing enough to attract Democratic moderates). But youll rarely find Republicans from or Bucks or Chester or Burlington counties actively seeking out those fights. Theyd rather focus on right-leaning economic policy. This week they tried to pull the rest of their party with them. Whats not clear is if this was a temporary victory, or a bigger change of direction.

Monmouth), who chaired Christies 2009 gubernatorial campaign, is supporting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Bush spokesman Tim Miller confirmed Tuesday. Miller also said Kyrillos made a $10,000 donation to Bushs super PAC. Kyrillos support of Bush was first reported Monday by the Washington Post. A former New Jersey Republican Party chairman who ran for the U.S. Senate in 2012, Kyrillos had previously indicated he was considering backing Bush, according to reports. Kyrillos has ties to the Bush family, including from working on the 1984 Ronald Reagan-George H.W. Bush campaign. He played a role in the 2008 presidential election, serving as New Jersey chairman forRepublican Mitt Romneys campaign. Kyrillos did not return messages Tuesday. Bill Palatucci, an adviser to Christie, said Tuesday that ninety-nine percent of New Jersey Republican leaders would be with the governor if he chose to be a candidate and no one is expected to have unanimous support from their home state. Former Republican Gov. Tom Kean said Kyrillos was a very well liked, very significant figure in the party. At the same time, I dont see any widespread defections, Kean said. I think the governors in pretty good shape in the state. People I talk to politically, theyre going to be with him. But Kean  often described as a mentor to Christie has not committed to a candidate. Im going to wait until at least everybodys in the field, he said. \"Im not leaning any way yet.\", Of Bush, Kean said he had \"always liked Jeb Bush tremendously. I think hes thoughtful and hes able. I think very highly of him. Kean, who was named chairman of the 9/11 Commission by President George W. Bush, also noted that his family has been friends with the Bush family for a generation or two.\", Among New Jersey voters, Christies support has waned. A Fairleigh-Dickinson PublicMind Poll released Tuesday found that 36 percent of the states voters approve of the governors job performance, while 50 percent disapprove. Poll director Krista Jenkins said the numbers were virtually unchanged since late February, when the poll recorded its lowest approval rating for Christie since he took office in 2010. Christies poll numbers are pretty dismal,\" said Carl Golden, a former press secretary to Kean and Republican Gov. Christie Whitman who is now a senior contributing analyst at the William J. Hughes Center for Public Policy at Richard Stockton College. To me, that is a much more significant measure of how people in New Jersey view the governor than is Joe Kyrillos supporting one of potentially 20 candidates in the Republican presidential race, Golden said. He said Christies presidential ambitions were weakened more by the commitment of fundraisers like Lawrence Bathgate  another New Jersey Republican and a former Republican National Committee finance chairman  to Bushs effort.

{"Content": "[Gov. Christie on Tuesday stepped up his criticism of Republican presidential rival Jeb Bush, arguing that the former governor of Florida is too rusty to tackle todays challenges and even associating him with Bill and Hillary Clinton. When you havent been in a relevant campaign as a Republican since 1998, youre going to continue to make the kind of mistakes that we see Gov. Bush making, Christie told the radio host Laura Ingraham. Specifically, the New Jersey governor cited what he described as Bushs gaffes with regard to relitigating the Iraq war and Bushs assertion that Asians are coming to the United States to have children to take advantage of birthright citizenship. The fact is, if what we want to do as a Republican Party is relitigate these old wars of the 90s and the 2000s, Jeb is the perfect candidate, Christie said. If what we want to do is actually win the presidency again, Id suggest to you we need someone whos been actually fighting these wars for the past six years.

Bushs conservative record of accomplishment is unmatched in the entire 2016 field, spokeswoman Allie Brandenburger said.

Asked to elaborate, Christie echoed GOP front-runner Donald Trumps attacks on Bush: If youre raising all this money, there are people going to be asking for things in return. By contrast, Christie said he had stood up against the Democratic machine in our state to enact overhauls of the pension and health benefit systems for public workers and vetoed crazy gun bills like one that would have reduced ammunition magazine capacity from 15 bullets to 10.

{"Content": "[The state Supreme Court has punted the controversial Voter ID case back to the states Commonwealth Court for additional review, according to an order released this afternoon. Commonwealth Court Judge Robert Simpson, in an Aug. 15 ruling rejecting a request for a preliminary injunction to keep the states new Voter ID law from being used during the Nov. 6 general election, repeatedly mentioned a new form of identification being developed by the Pennsylvania Department of State for voters who were having trouble obtaining other types of state-approved legislation that will be needed to cast a ballot. The Department of State started offering that new type of voter ID on Aug. 27. Ron Ruman, a spokesman for the Department of State, said Monday the state has issued about about 9,000 new identification cards for voting purposes since the law was passed in March. The Supreme Court, which heard an appeal of Simpsons ruling last Thursday, sent the case back to Commonwealth Court \"to make a present assessment of the actual availability of the alternate identification cards on a developed record in light of the experience since the time the cards became available.\" The Supreme Court wants that done by Oct. 2. Justices Debra McCloskey Todd and Seamus McCaffery filed a pair of joint dissents in the case, saying the Supreme Court should act now on the request for a preliminary injunction. Todd noted that the presidential election is 49 days away. \"The eyes of the nation are upon us, and this Court has chosen to punt rather than to act,\" Todd wrote. \"I will have no part of it.\", McCaffery pointed out that the state has offered no proof of the in-person voter fraud the Voter ID law is designed to prevent. He predicts that Simpsons review will again find \"many thousands\" of people without the proper ID to vote. \"I cannot in good conscience participate in a decision that so clearly has the effect of allowing politics to trump the solemn oath that I swore to uphold our Constitution,\" McCaffery wrote. \"That Constitution has made the right to vote a right verging on the sacred, and that right should never be trampled by partisan politics.\"]", "Date": "20120918", "Title": "[Supreme Court wants more lower court study on Voter ID]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/cityhall/Supreme-Court-wants-more-lower-court-study-on-Voter-ID.html\n", "Author": "[Chris Brennan ]"}
{"Content": "[Field Clinic bloggers react to Thursdays Supreme Court ruling upholding Affordable Care Act subsidies in all states:, Ruling disregarded the facts, We now know that the Roberts Court makes laws, it doesnt interpret them. His writing on this decision echoes the prior ruling on penalties or taxes. He decided both based on his view of societal good, not the facts of the case.  Howard Peterson, managing partner of Philadelphia-based TRG Healthcare, a national healthcare consulting firm. Supreme Court Got the Economics Right, Six justices on the court recognized that the overarching purpose and intent of the health care law was to make the individual health insurance market work. Prior to the ACA, buying affordable insurance on your own was extremely difficult and sometimes impossible because insurance companies logically tried to avoid higher risk consumers or charged them a lot more money. The ACA changed that by prohibiting insurance companies from charging higher prices to people with preexisting conditions  a provision only possible by requiring Americans to have insurance and making it affordable through subsidies. The Supreme Court understood the basic economic principles of the law and referred to them repeatedly in their majority opinion. Taking away subsidies in some states would have undercut the entire purpose and intent of the law. This case is likely the last big decision before the court that would have threatened the basic tenets of the Affordable Care Act. So the obvious question is, what next? Its time to move on. The ACA is working  we have record low levels of uninsurance in America and insurance rates have on average been lower than expected. But there are still important questions. Are the subsidies large enough to make health insurance affordable and are the plans generous enough? Its important to know if financial barriers are still getting in the way of good health outcomes. How should we help consumers choose the best plan? Insurance is incredibly complicated and even the most educated consumers struggle to make a good choice. There are ways to simplify and support those decisions. Do consumers have adequate choice of providers in their insurance plan? So called narrow networks that limit consumer choices of providers lower premiums but do they lead to better or worse health outcomes. These are hard questions to answer but in the long-run need to be answered. More importantly  as researchers answer them  it will require both political parties to come together to take what were learning from the ACA and then tweak the law in ways that further improve health.  David Grande, MD, director of policy at the University of Pennsylvanias Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics. Ruling protects law from future interference, \"Congress passed the ACA to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them.\", This was the key finding made by the Supreme Court in its landmark decision upholding that the ACA requires that premium subsidies apply in all 50 states. The 6-3 decision, written by Chief Justice Roberts, not only ensures that the Affordable Care Act is here to stay for the duration of President Obamas term in office. Even more importantly, it ties the hands of any future administration from re-interpreting the statute to deny the subsidies in states that have let the federal government run their exchanges. The Supreme Court could have ruled more narrowly, upholding the subsidies as a reasonable exercise of the IRSs administrative authority to implement a statute when the wording it unclear. Had it gone that way, a new President and his or her administration could have reinterpreted the statute so that the subsidies would no longer apply in states with federally-facilitated marketplaces. Instead,Justice Roberts on behalf of the court wrote, \"This is not a case for the IRS. It is instead our task to determine the correct reading of [the statute].\" And the statute, the court found, \"compels the Court to reject petitioners interpretation because it would destabilize the individual insurance market and likely create the very death spirals that Congress designed the Act to avoid.\" , The Supreme Court decision doesnt mean the end of the Obamacare wars, of course. Congressional Republicans will still try to get changes, although the courts decision takes away their leverage to try to force President Obama to agree to repeal of major provisions of the law in order to keep the subsidies going. I now predict that there will be no major legislative changes in the ACA until President Obama leaves office. The voters could elect a president in 2016 that is committed to changing or repealing Obamacare, but because the Supreme Court took away the next Presidents option to reinterpret the statute to discontinue the subsidies, they would need Congress to amend or repeal the law, no easy task. And by then, millions more Americans will have coverage from the ACA.  Bob Doherty, senior vice president, governmental affairs and public policy, American College of Physicians. Take nothing for granted, We can breathe a sigh of relief, and we can hope that the Affordable Care Acts future is further solidified. But, in light of continued opposition and calls for repeal, advocates must remain vigilant and effective in articulating all the ACA is doing to improve the health care system. Now is not the time to take anything for granted. By protecting subsidies, the court is protecting a big part of Obamacares hard-won coverage expansion. We simply must preserve and grow this expansion in coverage if hospital efforts to improve overall health and reduce health care spending are to succeed. People who have insurance are more likely to seek routine and preventive care and to take better care of themselvesessential steps toward better health that costs less on a per capita basis.  Andy Carter, president and CEO, Hospital & Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania. Next challenge: Make care more affordable, The Supreme Court ruling helps ensure that we can continue to provide the security and stability that our members have come to expect from Independence Blue Cross, no matter how they purchase their health insurance coverage. We have been serving our members for nearly 80 years, and no one has done more than we have to help make health care reform work. However, while the health care reform law has increased access for many, there is still work to be done to make health care more affordable. At Independence we are partnering with physicians and hospitals to introduce new models of care to transform the health care system and provide better coordinated, quality care that helps patients get healthy faster and stay healthy longer. We will continue to work with other health care leaders to improve the quality of health care and rein in costs for everyone.  Daniel J. Hilferty, president and CEO, Independence Blue Cross. Time to move the focus away from court cases, AsTimothy Jost mentioned in HealthAffairs,the King v. Burwell ruling may influence whether or not lower courts are willing to take on ACA cases. Since today marks the Supreme Courts second ruling in favor of the ACA, then hopefully this limits the number of ACA challenges coming through the court system. With this major victory for access to healthcare, hopefully the national spotlight can now be shared with important questions about healthcare cost and quality. - Marcelo H. Fernandez-Via, MPH,  Pa. should keep pursuing state marketplace, The Supreme Court decision is a huge victory for consumers. By ruling to uphold tax credits for individuals enrolled in the Federal Marketplace 349,000 Pennsylvanians will not have to worry about losing access to necessary medical care. The Supreme Court found what most experts believed from the beginning: the ACA is clear that subsidies are available in both federal and state exchanges. Now that the Supreme Court has ruled, instead of trying to undermine the law, opponents of health reform in Congress should accept that health care reform is here to stay and stop putting forward misguided proposals that would undermine its success. We applaud the Wolf Administration for being proactive in the event of an adverse ruling. Now that the tax credits are upheld expediting this process is no longer a necessity. We still believe it is an important avenue to explore. A state-based marketplace would shift control, oversight and, importantly, accountability, from the federal government to the state, and could be established without enacting any new taxes. We encourage the Wolf Administration and lawmakers to explore how a state-based marketplace could better serve Pennsylvanians over the course of the next year. - Antoinette Kraus, Director of the Pennsylvania Health Access Network, , Back to bland, I signed on to a friend of the court brief in support of the governments assertion about a drafting error in the King v. Burwell case, so I am naturally pleased with the outcome. But why does it feel like such a letdown? One answer was suggested by my colleague Skip Rosoffits how you feel after the mega-hurricane supposedly making a beeline for your backyard ends up fizzling out. What to say other than its back to business as usual, and business as usual is rarely the most exciting thing in the world. But not quite. One thing the decision did accomplish is to settle, once and for all, the legitimacy of federally run exchanges. The most obvious implication is that this may lead more states with their own exchanges, especially those with administrative or financial difficulties, to substitute the federal healthcare.gov exchange for your state-run insurance brokerage company. While individual states are bound to behave individually, can we make any general predictions how a shift from various state managements to a single federal management model will affect things?, One very plausible conjecture is that, at least as long as Republicans maintain a blocking coalition in Washington, we can be pretty sure that federal exchanges will not be doing anything dramatic. They will try to run an efficient operation and will try to emulate as much as possible other neutral arrangements for facilitating purchasinglike Travelocity of Amazon, as President Obama once said. Whats more important is what the federally run exchanges will not do, but some states either have done or are planning to do: federal exchanges will not be aggressive in controlling premiums, controlling the content or operation of insurance policies, or generally trying to use the power to keep a firm off the exchange website as leverage to get that firm to do something politically attractive or to punish the firm for perceived bad behavior. We need only look at Californias efforts to control the adequacy of networks, the extent of consumer protection, and other helpful but costly features to know that states with the opportunity find it hard to resist tweaking and sometimes more-than-tweaking the rules and the approvals to generate changes with populist benefits but hidden costs. I personally would like my planwere I shopping on an exchangeto have some of the features states have engineeredbut as an economist I am familiar with the absence of free lunches and as a sometime specialist in political economy I think it preferable to avoid substituting political pressure for the approbation of the market as a vehicle for deciding what tradeoffs are worth making.It shouldnt be up to me or depend on my opinion. Consumers who avoid buying a plan because it has a very narrow network will be more effective in ensuring network adequacy than any kind of subjectively-based regulation. So the bottom line is that King v. Burwell now legitimizes a way of generating and choosing among insurance plans that is going to be more politics-free than would have been the case with more state exchanges. There are some important problems remaining in many features of the ACA, and some real opportunities for improvement. But now the debate and discussion of those problems and programs will be returned to the legislative arena, and taken away both from the courts and from the unelected managers of exchanges. That seems like a step, not only toward democracy, but also toward stability and popularity for Obama care, which it surely needs. - Mark V.

{"Content": "[Two stories surfaced this week that provide more examples of how increasing drug prices have gotten totally out of hand. In the first one, a study in the medical journal Neurology tracked prices for multiple sclerosis (MS) medications during the past dozen years and uncovered an \"alarming rise\" that was substantially higher than even the overall price increases for prescription drugs. If anyone still needs a demonstration that drug prices reflect an oligopoly insulated from a competitive market, it appears in the studys finding that in the same period, prices for older MS medications -- those introduced between 1993 and 1996 -- also rose substantially after newer, more convenient medications starting appearing in 2002. As one of the studys co-authors told the Wall Street Journals Ed Silverman, You would think [with a competitive market] more new drugs would lower the rate of the increases, but that didnt happen. Among the newer MS meds launched after 2002, the study reported that three of them were originally priced between $8,000 and $11,000 annually. By the time of publication, their annual per patient cost climbed to approximately $60,000. Those price increases amounted to 21% to 36% per year. Another interesting finding concerned the prices paid by various purchasing entities. So for example, Medicaid receives legally mandated discounts but it still paid 36% more than the Veterans Administration which uses its purchasing power to negotiate favorable prices. Yet both the VA and Medicaid paid more than the national health plans in the UK, Canada and Australia. In the case of Medicaid, that price differential was 70% more than Canada/UK/Australia. Medicare, of course, paid considerably more than even Medicaid. Also this week, the Journals Silverman and his colleague, Jonathan Rockoff, reported that, \"More pharmaceutical companies are buying drugs...[and/or the companies that make them], then raising the prices.\" Combined with tactics where pharmas regularly raise \"the prices of their own older medicines and...[launch] new treatments at once unheard of sums,\" the practice has produced a 127% increase in branded-drug prices since 2008, even though the consumer price index rose by just 11% during the same period. Silverman and Rockoff provide two in-your-face examples of this price gouging to make the point. On February 10 of this year, Valeant bought a stable of older drugs from Marathon pharmaceuticals of Northbrook, Illinois. Included in the transaction were Nitropress, a injectable approved by the FDA in 1988 for relieving acute hypertension, and Isuprel, an oral medication for congestive heart failure that relaxes blood vessels and helps the heart pump blood more efficiently. The FDA approved Isuprel in 1999. On that same February day it acquired those two drugs, Valeant raised their list prices by 525% and 212%, respectively. A Valeant spokesperson recited the boilerplate, Chicago School meme for the Journal reporters, stating that, Our duty is to our shareholders and to maximize the value. For people whose sense of duty extends to stopping pharmas exploitation of American consumers, taxpayers and companies outside the industry, two trends are starting to gain support. The first appeared last Friday when the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) at the Department of Health and Human Services released results of a study comparing Medicare and Medicaid rebates for brand drugs. Similar to what it found in a 2011 study, OIG again saw substantial differences between drug prices paid by the two agencies. The agency this time concluded by encouraging \"CMS and Congress to explore the costs and benefits of obtaining additional rebates under [Medicare] Part D.\", While it appears most unlikely that the Republican-controlled Congress would do anything to displease their pharma contributors, some action to control this source of Medicare expense may occur in 2017 and afterward. The November 2016 elections will determine whether Congress and the next president seek to give Medicare negotiating rights that would save taxpayers billions of dollars they now bestow on drug companies. Meanwhile, the private market is making its own noises about the need to rein in pharmas abusive pricing. In recent years pharma companies have used brand co-pay assistance cards to defeat efforts by payers aimed at controlling drug costs. Insurers, employers and other payers rely on drug formularies to cost-effectively manage the prescription benefits they offer and the co-pay cards are pharmas \"formulary busters.\", So-called \"open formularies,\" those that permit their covered members access to all or nearly all approved medications, maintain only limited ability to encourage the use of cost-effective products. If plans with open formularies demand higher co-payments to discourage members from filling prescriptions for unjustly expensive brands, the manufacturer can frustrate the payers effort by covering that out-of-pocket cost for the patient. In an effort to combat the cost escalation created co-pay cards, some pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) such as Express Scrips have moved during the past eighteen months toward closed formularies that totally exclude overpriced brands from coverage. Currently only a minority of people in the U.S. have drug plans containing closed formularies. Observers of the private coverage scene predict the percentage of closed plans will rise substantially in the next couple of years because they represent an effective way to control rising premiums and employee contributions. PBMs now strongly encourage their employer clients to adopt closed formularies. The fact that generics constitute the overwhelming percentage (more than 85%) of all prescriptions makes it feasible for closed formularies to still offer a broad line of prescription coverage. So exorbitant drug pricing in the U.S. remains a source of corporate banditry, forcing some people to choose between food, medication and rent. Allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and moving more health care plans to closed drug formularies will help the situation, although other sources of outrageous cost and checkered quality will remain endemic in this countrys for-profit, health care system. Until public outcry can demand corrections to those larger factors, effective formulary management, together with granting Medicare the ability to negotiate drug prices, can at least help prevent overnight increases of 525%.

{"Content": "[Ten Republican Presidential candidates appeared in the primetime debate on August 6: Senator Marco Rubio from Florida, Senator Ted Cruz from Texas, Former Governor Jeb Bush from Florida, Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky, Governor Chris Christie from New Jersey, Governor Scott Walker from Wisconsin, Governor John Kasich from Ohio, Businessman Donald Trump, Physician Ben Carson, and Former Governor Mike Huckabee from Arkansas. Did they collectively endorse a system of single-payer health care that will cover all Americans and be paid for by a progressive tax on all forms of income? No. Did they stand up and pledge to defend womens reproductive rights? No. Did they say anything at all surprising? No. And even though you knew it; you watched anyway. With so many debaters and so many topics to cover, health care got relatively little attention. It seems clear that all the candidates oppose womens reproductive rights, that they are against funding for Planned Parenthood, and that they want the Affordable Care Act repealed and replaced. So, what did they say on the subject of public health? The full transcript is here. Ive summarized a few of their answers. On Medicaid:, With the exception of Governor Kasich, who was asked about his support for extending Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, there was little discussion of this effort to extend health care coverage. Governor Kasich provided a spirited defense of Medicaid expansion, first by noting that President Reagan expanded Medicaid, and then by pointing out that it saves money by giving the mentally ill treatment rather than sending them to prison. He reported that it is keeping the working poor healthy and out of emergency rooms so they can go to their jobs. And, finally, he said it is saving the state money. On the Affordable Care Act:, Repeal and replace is the favorite sound bite when the Affordable Care Act is mentioned. Trump, called it a disaster, and wants it repealed and replaced with a private system without artificial lines around every state. Governor Bush wants to get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something that doesnt suppress wages and kill jobs. Governor Walker and Senator Rubio also favor repealing and in Rubios case, replacing, the Affordable Care Act. On Reproductive Rights:, Womens reproductive rights brought a resounding chorus of no from the candidates who addressed this topic. Governor Walker affirmed his statement that he wanted to make abortion illegal even in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother, although he signed legislation in Wisconsin that does have an exception for the mothers life. In reply to one question on the topic, Walker said, Ive said many a time that that unborn child can be protected and there are many other alternatives that can also protect the life of that mother. Governor Huckabee affirmed his support for a constitutional amendment banning abortion and stated he wants to go further, I think the next president ought to invoke the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the constitution now that we clearly know that that baby inside the mothers womb is a person at the moment of conception. Challenged about his support for rape and incest as exceptions permitting abortion, Senator Rubio replied, I have never said that, adding What I have advocated is that we pass a law in this country that says all human life at every stage of its development is worthy of protection. Trump reported evolving from his previous pro-choice position to being pro-life saying I hate the concept of abortion, and later, I am very, very proud to say that I am pro-life. On Planned Parenthood:, Governor Walker reported, I defunded Planned Parenthood more than four years ago, long before those videos came out. In his closing remarks, Senator Cruz promised to instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into these videos and to prosecute Planned Parenthood for any criminal violations. What do they plan to do about health insurance?, I went to the candidates websites to find out how they planned to replace the Affordable Care Act. The statements are there in some cases, but none of the websites provide details about the funding of replacement plans or make clear just who or what will be covered under the plans. Many candidates offer no information about their health care plans. They have time to figure it out. The Republican National Convention is 11 months away (July 18-21, 2016 back in Cleveland). Perhaps well learn some details after the nominee is selected. The Democratic National Convention will be here in Philadelphia a few weeks later (July 25-28, 2016) Well look to see what the Democratic Party candidates have to say after their debate.

{"Content": "[One month to the day after the United States women won the World Cup - and one year to the day before the start of the 2016 Olympics - head coach Jill Ellis got a multi-year contract extension from the U.S. Soccer Federation. Although the news was greeted with mixed emotions in some quarters of the teams fan base, star midfielder and team captain Carli Lloyd gave a strong endorsement. \"Im really excited,\" the Delran native told me in an exclusive interview Wednesday evening. \"I think that Ive got a good relationship with Jill. We respect one another and Im happy to see shes sticking around... Shes done a really good job managing our team and bringing in all the right people.\", Ellis contract had originally been set to expire at the end of the year. Lloyd admitted that she \"wasnt sure what was going to happen - if [Ellis] just thought winning the Womens World Cup was great and then shed move on.\", Now that Ellis is officially staying on, the programs focus turns to preparation for next summers trip to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The United States is the two-time defending Olympic champion, thanks in no small part to decisive goals from Lloyd in the 2008 and 2012 gold medal games. Lloyd has made no secret of her desire to be on the 2016 Olympic team, but its not yet clear how many veterans will make the 18-player squad. And its a very big deal that Olympic rosters are smaller than the 23-player squads for World Cups. \"There are going to be some tough decisions, and I think it just is going to depend on who is playing well at that time and whos good enough to get selected - whether youre a veteran and kind of in the latter stages of your career, or youre a young player,\" Lloyd said. \"Its just going to come down to performance at the end of the day.\", Expect a lot of conversations between now and then about when the right time will be to start bringing more young players in the squad. In a statement issued by U.S. Soccer, Ellis acknowledged that there is going to be \"some turnover\" in the coming months, \"but thats always part of the natural evolution.\", During a conference call with reporters Wednesday afternoon, Ellis said that \"we want to honor the players [of] the past\" and make short-term preparations for Olympic qualifying in February, but also \"use this opportunity to evaluate and assess for the future.\", She added that \"if a player is good enough and will help us be successful, thats the priority,\" and \"I certainly will be looking toward the future as well as whats directly in front of me. With Lauren Holiday and Shannon Boxx having announced theyll retire at the end of this year, there may be opportunities for new players to break through. But other veterans, most notablyAbby Wambach and Christie Rampone, have not yet said when theyll hang up their cleats. I asked Lloyd what she has heard about her teammates plans. She told me: \"I dont know what Abby [Wambach] is thinking, I dont know what [Christie] Rampone is thinking.\", But Lloyd is well aware that a corps of young players in the National Womens Soccer League looks ready to have a shot at the international stage. Leading the way is the Washington Spirits Crystal Dunn, who scored a hat trick against Lloyds Houston Dash last weekend. Dunn was widely regarded as the last player cut from the World Cup squad. You might remember that she was on a list of the best players not to make the team that the Inquirers Lauren Green and I compiled before the tournament. \"Crystal has done really well for herself,\" Lloyd said. \"I think theres a lot of other talented players in the league who just need to be brought in, get their feet wet, get used to the pace - it is a little different, as expected - and kind of grow.\", And those players have to prove that they can match the mental strength of the generations of national team stars whove come before them. \"Consistency and being able to perform each and every day is the most important thing for players to get looked at and to be able to be seen, \" Lloyd said. \"Its a tough environment mentally... Theres a lot of challenges coming into the national team for the first time and trying to stay there.\", Its also possible that European leagues will become a more viable option for American players, although perhaps not in the short time frame before the Olympics. France, Germany and England are increasingly becoming destinations for the worlds top womens talent. Theres already one prominent American abroad, Paris Saint-Germain forward Lindsay Horan. Ellis said she would prefer that national team players stay home \"because we can then have access to them, but we never will overlook a player who is overseas if they can help us. On the same conference call, U.S. Soccer president Sunil Gulati backed Ellis up on that, saying the coach can \"bring in whoever she would like\" for the games between now and the Olympics. \"She can bring in World Cup players, or non-World Cup players, or college players that are available, or anyone else,\" Gulati added. \"Even for the games this fall.\", Lloyd said she wouldnt be surprised if American players test the waters abroad after the Olympics to have a more diverse playing experience. But she added that right now, the NWSL needs them in order to grow. \"The NWSL is definitely at a level where we need to keep it and build it,\" Lloyd said. \"Every year it requires getting better and on different fronts. Every single player in the league deserves to play in front of a packed house [and] the level of play is good enough for people to come out and enjoy.\", That prompted me to ask a question that has been on the minds of many of Lloyds fans back home: what will it take to get a NWSL team in Philadelphia?, Lloyd didnt hesitate to answer, pointing at the Philadelphia Union as an entity that she feels needs to be involved. Its a view formed largely by the fact that the Dash is run by Houstons Major League Soccer team, the Dynamo. \"I think having a [NWSL] team affiliated with a MLS team is whats going to help,\" she said. \"It has the whole structure, and really the only thing that is needed is to sell tickets and get people out to the games. At the end of the day thats how the owners are going to make money.\", For the time being, though, Lloyd and her teammates are still basking in the World Cup afterglow. Over 40,000 tickets have been sold for the Americans first World Cup victory tour game, against Costa Rica at Pittsburghs Heinz Field on August 14. Three days later, the teams will meet again before a sellout crowd of 20,000 in Chattanooga, Tenn. In September, the U.S. will play two games against Australia - first at Ford Field in Detroit, then at Legion Field in Birmingham, Ala. Both games have already sold over 25,000 tickets each. The last question I asked Lloyd was one Ive wanted to put to her ever since the World Cup ended, but didnt have a chance to until now. We all saw how she and her teammates were unleashed in the latter stages of the World Cup, and how the teams mentality on and off the field took off like a rocket because of it. So Ive been wondering: at what point did Lloyd know the U.S. was going to win the World Cup?, \"After we beat China,\" she answered. \"I felt a shift in our team, \"I felt a shift in myself, my confidence was booming after that. And from that point on, I knew that if we brought the same energy and excitement and level of play from the china game on, there was not a team in the world that would be able to stop us.\", So it proved.]", "Date": "20150806", "Title": "[Carli Lloyd 'excited' that Jill Ellis will remain U.S. women's coach]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/thegoalkeeper/Carli-Lloyd-excited-that-Jill-Ellis-will-remain-US-womens-coach.html\n", "Author": "[Jonathan Tannenwald, Philly.com ]"}
{"Content": "[Here is the official statement from FIFA president Sepp Blatter announcing his resignation. If you watched Blatters remarks on TV, you saw Blatter speak in French. This is FIFAs translation to English of those remarks. Blatters speech was followed by a statement from Domenico Scala, the independent chairman of FIFAs audit compliance commitee. Those remarks are posted after Blatters below. REMARKS BY FIFA PRESIDENT SEPP BLATTER, I have been reflecting deeply about my presidency and about the forty years in which my life has been inextricably bound to FIFA and the great sport of football. I cherish FIFA more than anything and I want to do only what is best for FIFA and for football. I felt compelled to stand for re-election, as I believed that this was the best thing for the organisation. That election is over but FIFAs challenges are not. FIFA needs a profound overhaul. While I have a mandate from the membership of FIFA, I do not feel that I have a mandate from the entire world of football - the fans, the players, the clubs, the people who live, breathe and love football as much as we all do at FIFA. Therefore, I have decided to lay down my mandate at an extraordinary elective Congress. I will continue to exercise my functions as FIFA President until that election. The next ordinary FIFA Congress will take place on 13 May 2016 in Mexico City. This would create unnecessary delay and I will urge the Executive Committee to organise an Extraordinary Congress for the election of my successor at the earliest opportunity. This will need to be done in line with FIFAs statutes and we must allow enough time for the best candidates to present themselves and to campaign. Since I shall not be a candidate, and am therefore now free from the constraints that elections inevitably impose, I shall be able to focus on driving far-reaching, fundamental reforms that transcend our previous efforts. For years, we have worked hard to put in place administrative reforms, but it is plain to me that while these must continue, they are not enough. The Executive Committee includes representatives of confederations over whom we have no control, but for whose actions FIFA is held responsible. We need deep-rooted structural change. The size of the Executive Committee must be reduced and its members should be elected through the FIFA Congress. The integrity checks for all Executive Committee members must be organised centrally through FIFA and not through the confederations. We need term limits not only for the president but for all members of the Executive Committee. I have fought for these changes before and, as everyone knows, my efforts have been blocked. This time, I will succeed. I cannot do this alone. I have asked Domenico Scala to oversee the introduction and implementation of these and other measures. Mr. Scala is the Independent Chairman of our Audit and Compliance Committee elected by the FIFA Congress. He is also the Chairman of the ad hoc Electoral Committee and, as such, he will oversee the election of my successor. Mr. Scala enjoys the confidence of a wide range of constituents within and outside of FIFA and has all the knowledge and experience necessary to help tackle these major reforms. It is my deep care for FIFA and its interests, which I hold very dear, that has led me to take this decision. I would like to thank those who have always supported me in a constructive and loyal manner as President of FIFA and who have done so much for the game that we all love. What matters to me more than anything is that when all of this is over, football is the winner. REMARKS BY DOMENICO SCALA, INDEPENDENT CHAIRMAN AUDIT & COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE, Before I begin, I would like to thank the President. The decision that he has made today was difficult and courageous. In the current circumstances, this is the most responsible way to ensure an orderly transition. I know that he has truly acted with the best interests of FIFA and football in his heart. I have a great amount of respect for the President and the role that he has played in championing reform within FIFA. As he has recognised, we have worked hard to put in place governance reforms. But this has not been enough. By making this announcement, he has created an opportunity for us to go further than FIFA has before  to fundamentally change the way in which FIFA is structured. As the independent Chairman of the Audit and Compliance committee, I am committed to working to facilitate the implementation of the reforms that the President has outlined and to putting in place the conditions for the election of a new President. As the President has stated, these reforms will include fundamental changes to the way in which this organisation is structured  steps that go far beyond the actions that have been implemented to this point. I would like to provide you with additional details into the process that FIFA will follow moving forward. Under the rules governing FIFA, the election of the President and any fundamental reforms to the FIFA statutes must be voted on by the Members at the FIFA Congress. The next FIFA Congress is scheduled for May 2016 in Mexico City. As the President has stated, this would be an unnecessary delay. In order to facilitate more immediate action, the President will ask the Executive Committee to organise an Extraordinary Congress in order to elect the new President and vote upon these reforms. Based upon the FIFA statutes, a four-month notice is required for any presidential elections to be held. FIFA must also consider appropriate time to vet candidates and allow them to present their ideas for the organisation that set forth their vision. Therefore, while the decision on timing of the Extraordinary Congress and election of a new President will ultimately be up to the Executive Committee, the expectation is that this could take place anytime from December of this year to March of next year. For years, FIFA has worked hard to put in place governance reforms, but as the President has stated, this must go further to implement deep-rooted structural change. The President has outlined a number of specific recommendations to achieve this. A number of these steps have previously been proposed but have been rejected by Members. Today more than ever, FIFA is committed to ensuring that these changes are implemented and upheld. As part of FIFAs work, the organisation will re-examine the way in which it is structured. While it would be premature to speculate on the outcomes of this work, nothing will be off the table, including the structure and composition of the Executive Committee and the way in which members of the Executive Committee are elected. I expect this to be an important aspect ofongoing reform. As I said a year ago, the structure of the Executive Committee and its Members are at the core of the current issues that FIFA is facing. Current events only reinforce my determination to drive this reform. Many of the issues that have been raised in the past relate to the actions of individuals. In order to ensure that those who represent FIFA are of the highest integrity, FIFA will seek to implement FIFA-driven integrity checks for all Executive Committee members. Such a reform was previously proposed by the Independent Governance Committee but was rejected by the Confederations. Today these checks are the responsibility of the confederations to which these members belong. This must change. Confederations actions must be consistent with their speech. While FIFA operates in line with all applicable laws and international accounting standards, FIFA recognises that many have questioned the transparency by which FIFA operates. To address specific calls, FIFA will seek to publicize the compensation of the President and the Executive Committee Members and will propose term limits for the President and Executive Committee members. FIFA is fundamentally committed to change and are determined to address the issues that continue to undermine FIFA and football more broadly. Today, the President communicated his decision to all 209 Members. Now is the time for FIFA to move forward. There is significant work to be done in order to regain the trust of the public and to fundamentally reform the way in which people see FIFA. These steps will ensure that the organization cannot be used by those seeking to enrich themselves at the expense of the game.]", "Date": "20150602", "Title": "[Full text: FIFA president Sepp Blatter statement on resignation]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/thegoalkeeper/Full-text-FIFA-president-Sepp-Blatter-statement-on-resignation.html\n", "Author": "[Jonathan Tannenwald, Philly.com ]"}
{"Content": "[Sam Borden of the New York Times spoke Thursday with U.S. Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati, who announced that Americas delgate in Fridays FIFA presidential election will vote forPrince Ali bin al-Hussein. Al-Hussein is the only challenger to the current FIFA president, Joseph \"Sepp\" Blatter. In February, the United States was one of six nations who officially nominated Ali as a candidate. The other countries were England,Belarus, Georgia, Malta and Alis native Jordan. Gulati, a member of FIFAs executive committee, i is well aware of the potential ramifications of turning against the king and king-maker of international soccers governing body. Chief among those ramifications is that if Blatter wins (which he almost surely will), he could exact retribution by denying a potential U.S. bid to host the 2026 World Cup. It looks like Gulati - who teaches at Columbia University in addition to his U.S. Soccer and FIFA work - is ready to accept those ramifications. Here is an exceprt of what he told Borden:, Would I like to see the United States host a World Cup in the future? Gulati said. The answer is, of course, yes. But for me, and for U.S. soccer, better governance and more integrity at Concacaf and FIFA are far more important than hosting any international soccer tournament. He added: Im sure there are some people who would disagree with that decision and would prioritize things differently. But this is how we feel, and we are doing what we think is right. If being on the right side of issues costs us from hosting a World Cup in the future, that would be unfortunate. But we are prepared to deal with that. Borden later tweeted this additional quote from Gulati:, Gulati: \"Will it affect peoples views of me? It will affect some. That goes with being a US natl. And that is something Im very proud of\", Gulati himself will not cast the U.S. vote because hes on the FIFA That, according to Borden, will be done by U.S. Soccer Federation treasurer Carlos Cordeiro. All 209 FIFA member nations are eligible to vote. After Bordens story was published, Gulati took to Twitter himself to make his point clear:, U.S. Soccer will vote for Prince Ali bin Al Hussein for next president of FIFA. This is a vote for good governance & promise for our game. Gulati then spoke with another group of reporters on a conference call. Some highlights:, Gulati, when interviewing candidates for FIFA prez, said he didnt care about WC slots or financial assistance, only good governance. Sunil Gulati: \"Premature\" to say if 2016 Copa Amrica Centenario will end up happening in the US. Massive bribes charged by DOJ with event. FWIW: U.S. Soccer had said in January that a final decision on Copa Amrica Centenario host cities would come in May. http://t.co/RjxxWkRItW, Gulati: \"I think you will see a lot closer [FIFA] vote tomorrow than people were projecting some weeks ago.\", FWIW, Gulati declined to answer whether he had been interviewed by FBI, DOJ, or IRS. Said he wouldnt comment on an ongoing investigation. One of the United States top rivals in the potential bidding for 2026 will also vote against Blatter. Canadian Soccer Association president Victor Montagliani told the Canadian Press Thursday evening that FIFA \"needs a definite change, a refresh.\", Our BoD met and has made the decision of voting for Prince Bin Ali Hussein as we cannot support the current political leadership of FIFA. We felt that it was in line with our strategic plan and our own governance reform that we want to govern the game professionally. We want to be front & centre on ensuring that the reforms that happens in world football are done in a transparent way but quicker fashion. Earlier Thursday, Montagliani and Gulati - along with soon-to-retire Mexican federation president Justino Compean - were named to a commission tasked with \"charged with the duties of evaluating and sustaining all of the business operations\" of CONCACAF in the wake of Wednesdays dramatic indictments by the U.S. government. Among the indicted were CONCACAF president Jeffrey Webb and Costa Rica federation president Eduardo Li. Both men were \"provisionally dismissed\" from the North and Central American confederation on Thursday. CONCACAF secretary general Enrique Sanz - widely believed to be \"Co-Conspirator #4\" in the indictment of Webb, Li and others - was also \"suspended indefinitely.\", Costa Rica and Panama have since stated publicly that their delegates will vote for al-Hussein.UEFA, the confederation of European national associations, will back al-Hussein as well. The Asianand African confederations have said they will back Blatter. The election will be contested in up to two rounds. If one candidate does not secure two-thirds of the votes in the first round, only a simple majority will be needed in the second.

{"Content": "[By Robert W. Patterson, When Nancy Pelosi pleaded with her Democratic colleagues to slow down the fast-track to get to a better deal for the American people, the House minority leader inadvertently helped the GOP. By pulling the plug on President Obamas crony corporatist trade deal, Pelosi effectively held Republicans back from colluding with an unpopular president to fully subordinate American democracy, power, and interests to globalist demands. Days before the showdown, NBC News reported that two-thirds of Americans, Democrats and Republicans alike, oppose trade arrangements that exchange family-wage jobs for allegedly cheaper consumer goods. Other polling finds that free-trade deals trouble the Republican rank-and-file more than the Democrats. And reports from Capitol Hill indicate that constituent calls overwhelmingly oppose the GOP-Obama trade package. So by abandoning the 2014 midterm voters that gave Republicans control of both houses of Congress to check Obama, the GOP leadership squandered some hard-won political capital, complicating the partys quest to defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016 and retain the U.S. Senate. Nowhere is this political irony more on display than in the Keystone State, where 10 of 12 Pennsylvania Republican congressmen  and Pat Toomey in the Senate  did the bidding not only of party leadership but also the multinational behemoths and big banks. In contrast, four of six New Jersey GOP representatives voted against Obamatrade. Only second-termers Scott Perry of York County and Keith Rothfus of Western Pennsylvania stood up for an industrial state still reeling from ominous trade deficits and the hollowing out of U.S. manufacturing, all of which accelerated when a Democratic Congress fell for the same free-trade song and dance when ratifying NAFTA 22 years ago. Perhaps Pat Meehan of working-class Delaware County, Mike Fitzpatrick of suburban Bucks, Charlie Dent of the Lehigh Valley, and Joe Pitts of Dutch Country have yet to digest how globalization policies that privilege finance over manufacturing have liquidated the private-sector middle class, depressing GOP Electoral College fortunes, especially in their beloved state. They could take pointers from Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan. Those Republicans  who wooed rather than alienated trade-union households  triggered landslide elections and captured decisive majorities in Pennsylvania. Even George H.W. Bush, the last GOP presidential nominee to capture Pennsylvania, followed the wiser strategy of heeding voter sentiment to reach the presidency. On the Friday before the 1988 election, with polls showing Democrat Michael Dukakis closing fast in the Rust Belt, the GOP nominee wrote to Sen. John Heinz, the Pennsylvania steel champion, promising to extend Reagans policies that leveled the playing field for a U.S. steel industry ailing from global overcapacity. The mouthpiece of globalism and anti-Americanism, the New York Times smeared Bush as an opportunist. But Bushs commitment to deliver economic tangibles to Middle America won him the White House, a lesson he subsequently forgot. As has the current GOP. Even after Pelosi warned him that the dubious trade package was doomed, Speaker John Boehner pressed ahead with his fatal vote. Indeed, his leadership colleagues seem as bedazzled by free-trade abstractions as Democrats by global-warming ideology. Thats an unfortunate departure from the trade realism of Reagan, who vigorously defended American interests against unfair foreign competition. The model conservative president delivered import relief not only for steel but also for other domestic concerns, including automobiles, motorcycles, sugar, electronics, lumber, textiles, and machine tools. Equally important, the Gipper forced Japan to cease manipulating the yen. The industrial island nation returned to the stealth practice in the 1990s, reimposing a mammoth trade barrier that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) does nothing to address. Consequently, Reagan would not be fooled by the overrated Pacific proposal, which would add nothing to existing free-trade pacts that America already enjoys with 80 percent of the TPP market. Nor would he entertain illusions that Japan  whose GDP represents 18 of the remaining 20 percent  will allow Ford to sell Fusions in Tokyo. Or that the TPP allows the United States to write the rules of trade: Obama has steadfastly ignored Congress for six years, but invited multinational lobbyists to help negotiate and draft his treaty. Meanwhile, the secret pact remains in the basement of the U.S. Capitol under tighter security than our southern border. Pelosi, the Democratic powerhouse from California, has given Republicans, especially those representing Pennsylvania, another chance to return the affections of the voters that put them into office. And if they pursue a fast-track to expand the Main Street economy  not merely Wall Streets  they might win big in 2016. Robert W. Patterson served in the administrations of President George W.

{"Content": "[Since World War II, the greatest GOP presidents  Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan  won the Keystone State decisively. Even Richard Nixon took every county statewide save Philadelphia in 1972, capturing 59 percent of Pennsylvania voters. And when elected in 1904, Theodore Roosevelt carried the state with the widest margin (68 percent) of any president since his party was formed in 1854. Republican standard-bearers havent wowed the state since 1988, and the same big-money consultants who engineered the campaigns of Bob Dole, John McCain, and Mitt Romney seem ready to write off Pennsylvania again, seeking a road to victory through neighboring Ohio and, increasingly, Florida. So while the Republican National Convention heads to Cleveland next July, establishment donors and pundits are waxing rhapsodically over two Floridians  former Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio  who rank first and fourth, respectively, in the RealClearPolitics polling average for GOP contestants. But consigning the Keystone State to Hillary Clinton in 2016 would render a blunder of the first order, especially as early polling shows Republicans matching her numbers statewide. Yes, its theoretically possible for the GOP to eke out a narrow victory delivering Ohio and Florida while losing Pennsylvania; that was Karl Roves too-clever-by-half minimalist approach with George W. Bush. Yet the last thing the country needs is another 51-49 percent squeaker election. After a generation of party-to-party see-sawing leaving no clear direction for a nation in decline, we need a landslide of Reaganesque and Ike-proportions. Or echoing that of TRs. Perhaps the most popular of all Republican presidents, the Mount Rushmore figure didnt gain the peoples trust by cozying up to Wall Street and bowing to elite opinion or the sycophant courts that codify it. No, as historian Daniel Ruddy explores in his latest book, Theodore the Great: Conservative Crusader, the Trust Busters passion was making government responsive to the people, not to the invisible government of the malefactors of great wealth, who had dictated policy to a compliant Congress since the end of the Civil War. The Rough Rider not only built and maintained his partys congressional majority during two midterm elections but also, Ruddy argues, would likely have served a total of five terms had he not hastily promised not to run again after his 1904 victory. In contrast to todays GOP-controlled Congress, which seems all to eager to carry water for the big banks on regulation and for multinational corporations on trade, TR demonstrated daring independence from the plutocrats at every turn. The 26th president not only busted the Northern Securities railroad monopoly but also delivered a follow-up punch to J.P. Morgan, setting the model of fair labor relations by mediating the Pennsylvania anthracite-coal strike. In his second term, Roosevelt challenged John D. Rockefeller by implementing utility-like railroad regulation while venting outrage at the Supreme Courts infamous Lochner decision, which voided commonsense state labor laws that allegedly violated rights imagined out of the 14th Amendment. Given how the disparities of the late 19th century have returned to haunt a neglected Middle America, your great-grandfathers GOP under the Roosevelt surely beats the stalwart version that has struggled to endear the electorate since President George H.W. Bush broke from Reagans winning playbook. Replaying William Howard Tafts bad act after TR, Republican leaders overlook the insurgent Gippers challenge to the powerbrokers: identify with and deliver economic tangibles to the average Americans whom TR affectionately called the plain people. Moreover, the peace through strength commanders-in-chief of the second half of the last century  Ike, Nixon, and Reagan  would never ignore the sixth most-populous state. All would grasp the upside: By winning Pennsylvania, other electorally rich states including Ohio, Michigan, and yes, Florida, would likely fall into the GOP fold like dominos. Maybe even New Jersey and Illinois. In contrast, Bush 41s kindler and gentler policies, Bush 43s compassionate conservatism, and Jebs reform conservatism offer little to Northern states. Indeed, the Bush family model  which failed to deliver the Holy Grail of 4-percent annual-GDP growth during three terms, and created the first postwar presidency (43) to record zero net-job creation  doesnt resonate in Pennsylvania, a state waning from private-sector, family-wage job losses and a higher-than-average U6 unemployment rate (11.6 percent), which includes frustrated part-timers and labor-force dropouts who still want to work. Rather than pushing for more outsourcing deals and H-1B visas, pandering to non-citizens legal and illegal, or demanding budget austerity via Social Security and Medicare reforms, the party needs a populist, America-first agenda. One that reboots U.S. manufacturing via balanced trade, develops and deploys a next-generation missile-defense system to protect our homeland and allies, and builds a transportation infrastructure fitting a 21st-century superpower. It should also require initiatives that employ only U.S. citizens and made-at-home materials, while fully securing the border and curtailing out-of-control immigration. Reviving the older, yet proven GOP vision would not merely beat Hillary but also win the Keystone State. And restore a party that would make TR and Reagan proud. Robert W.

{"Content": "[New Jersey has reached a $225 million settlement with ExxonMobil Corp. over the oil giants decades-long contamination of 1,500 acres of land, the states acting attorney general said Thursday, a deal that faces fierce opposition among Democrats and environmentalists who wanted the state to stand by its demand for billions in damages. The announcement came the same day the states former top environmental regulator accused Gov. Christies chief counsel of interfering in the litigation and pushing aside career prosecutors in the process. The proposed settlement is expected to be published in the New Jersey Register on April 6, after which it would be subject to a 30-day public comment period. It must be approved by a state judge. Officials called it the single largest environmental settlement with a corporate defendant in New Jersey history. Acting Attorney General John Hoffman said that in addition to paying the settlement, Exxon had already agreed to remediate its contaminated refinery sites in Linden and Bayonne at its own expense. The settlement ensures the continuation of the ExxonMobil-funded remediation work at these contaminated sites, and it holds the company financially accountable, Hoffman said. Lawmakers and environmentalists had already criticized the settlement, as terms leaked to the press ahead of the official announcement Thursday. In an op-ed published Thursday in the New York Times, Bradley M. Campbell, the former commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection who authorized the lawsuit against Exxon in 2004, called the settlement a disgrace and an embarrassment to law enforcement and good government. He said former colleagues in state government had told him that Christopher Porrino, the governors chief counsel, elbowed aside the attorney general and career employees who had developed and prosecuted the litigation, and cut the deal favorable to Exxon. Hoffmans office said Thursday that the litigation and settlement negotiations, as with all such cases of this magnitude, were conducted by the attorney generals office in coordination with the Department of Environmental Protection and the Governors Office. He said settling the case rather than continuing to litigate provides a predictable, fair outcome for the people of New Jersey. The allegation of interference by Christies office comes as state lawmakers have vowed to scuttle the settlement in court and hold a public hearing to determine what happened. \"If what is alleged took place, then this is much bigger than any kind of litigation and its a subject matter for Paul Fishman,\" Senate President Stephen Sweeney (D. Gloucester) said on a conference call with reporters Thursday, referring to the U.S. attorney for New Jersey. First, Sweeney cautioned, \"Weve got to find out if whats alleged is true.\", The allegation also raises questions about the independence of the attorney generals office. Although Hoffman has led the office for more than a year, Christie has not nominated him to be confirmed by the Democrat-controlled Senate. Christie previously tapped his former chief of staff, Kevin ODowd, for the post. But the nomination didnt proceed in the wake of the George Washington Bridge lane-closure scandal, which erupted in January 2014. ODowd wasnt accused of wrongdoing but left the administration last year to work for Cooper University Hospital. The 2004 lawsuit alleged that, for decades, Exxons plants and refineries in Linden and Bayonne contaminated the states wetlands, marshes, and creeks. The case finally moved to trial last year, and all that was left to determine was what Exxon owed in damages; state prosecutors had sought $8.9 billion. The judge was apparently close to issuing a ruling. But in January, the state asked the judge to delay a decision so that settlement talks could proceed, the New York Times reported last week. Environmentalists have accused Christie, a Republican considering running for president in 2016, of quickly securing the settlement so he could divert money to the states general fund. Under the appropriations bill he signed in June, the first $50 million the state obtains \"in natural resource, cost recoveries and other associated damages\" must be deposited into a fund for hazardous discharge cleanup. But the law says all money obtained beyond that shall be diverted to the general fund. Democrats had sought to allocate half of such money -- beyond the initial $50 million -- to environmental programs, but Christie vetoed that language. Hoffman said Thursday the state wouldnt receive settlement monies until fiscal year 2016 at the earliest. The funds would be allocated in accordance with the appropriations act for that fiscal year, which begins July 1. Records filed with the Internal Revenue Service show Exxon donated $500,000 to the Republican Governors Association in 2014, when Christie chaired the group and raised record sums to help elect GOP governors across the country. Exxon has said it has long contributed to the organization. Christies office didnt immediately respond to a request for comment. Under the proposed settlement, the state maintains its claims against Exxon for contamination at other sites, the attorney generals office said. ]", "Date": "20150305", "Title": "[N.J. agrees to settlement with Exxon over contamination]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/trenton-takes/Former-DEP-chief-Christies-office-pushed-for-Exxon-settlement.html\n", "Author": "[Andrew Seidman ]"}
{"Content": "[TRENTON -- New Jersey Senate President Stephen Sweeney says the push to expand gaming beyond Atlantic City has devolved into a legislative free for all that has little chance of making the ballot in November. You have a scrum right now between legislators throughout the state, Sweeney (D. Gloucester) told reporters Thursday. Its a scrum. Its not just a South Jersey issue. The race to put gaming on the ballot this year heated up last week when three North Jersey lawmakers proposed a constitutional amendment that would allow the state to establish up to three casinos in Essex, Hudson, and Bergen Counties. Then on Monday, three Central Jersey legislators made a counter offer: one casino in North Jersey and one in Central Jersey. Given the competing proposals, Sweeney said it was unlikely that either could win enough votes to pass in the Assembly and Senate. As Senate president, he has the authority to decide whether his chamber will even hold a vote on the issue. Some legislators in their wisdom actually said where to put the casinos, Sweeney said. That creates a problem. Lawmakers would need to pass a proposed amendment with a three-fifths majority in both houses by Aug. 3 to put a gaming question on the ballot. Any proposal to expand gaming beyond Atlantic City would require voter approval. Sweeney and others warn that an amendment might not pass this year, when Assembly elections top the ballot and voter turnout is expected to be low. Plus, Sweeney says, lawmakers havent reached a consensus on how to tax new gaming revenues and how much would be directed to nongaming development in Atlantic City. He has suggested that it would be easier to win voter approval in 2016, when turnout will be higher for the presidential election. I think this is too important to not get it right, he said. Four casinos closed in the resort town last year. Developers have proposed sites in Jersey City and the Meadowlands. Essex County Executive Joe DiVincenzo and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka held a press conference yesterday calling for a casino in Newark. This needs to be a public discussion and not a race, where its a backroom deal, Sweeney said. It needs to be very much out in the publics eye. ]", "Date": "20150611", "Title": "[Sweeney denounces casino 'scrum' ]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/trenton-takes/Sweeney-denounces-casino-scrum.html\n", "Author": "[Andrew Seidman ]"}
{"Content": "[The Republican presidential candidates are set to crucify each other on crosses of gold. GOP leaders exulted a few years ago when the Supreme Courts Citizens United ruling and other decisions invited the rich to pour unlimited sums into political campaigns - and they are, by the billions of dollars. But the Law of Unintended Consequences frequently rules the practice of politics, and it has once again. Republican candidates are hauling in so much money that the flood of cash has washed away the Darwinian system of natural selection that previously allowed parties to pick their nominees. In the past, if candidates polled poorly, their fund-raising would dry up and theyd have to drop out of the race. But such market principles no longer apply because a large number of unviable candidates are artificially subsidized - kept in the race by a beneficent billionaire, or even a friendly multimillionaire or two. My Washington Post colleagues Matea Gold and Ed OKeefe reported Monday that no fewer than 15 White House hopefuls are being assisted by outside groups typically formed as \"super PACs\" and run by the candidates allies. For the first time in the modern political era, political operatives say its possible the eventual nominee need not win in either Iowa or New Hampshire. Still-undeclared candidate Jeb Bush, who is on course to haul in $100 million by the end of next month, boasted to donors Sunday night that his fund-raising has been historic (so good that his too-successful super PAC temporarily limited contributions to $1 million). But Bushs take, Gold and OKeefe noted, hasnt stopped groups from raising, in short order, $20 million or $30 million apiece for Ted Cruz, Scott Walker, and Marco Rubio. With that kind of money available, youre unlikely to quit even if youre an asterisk in the polls. The outright acquisition of the primary process by the wealthy is the latest instance of the 1 percent taking over the American political system - although in this case its more likely the top 1 percent of the top 1 percent. As the Center for Responsive politics notes, the top 1 percent of donors to super PACS (about 100 people and their spouses) contributed 67 percent of super-PAC funds in 2012. Fred Wertheimer, a campaign-finance reformer who runs the group Democracy 21, predicts that for the first time, spending by super PACs will exceed spending by candidates and parties combined in the 2016 presidential campaign, which is expected to cost some $5 billion. In the 2012 primary, billionaire Sheldon Adelsons money kept Newt Gingrich in the race long after he was a viable candidate (if he ever was). But if billionaires reached the moon in 2012, \"this election will take us to Mars,\" Wertheimer says. \"We have a political system that is pre-Watergate and allows relatively few people to keep candidates in the race for extended periods of time. Its going to create artificial candidates. ... Its going to open the door for influence-buying and corruption, and we have the Supreme Court to thank for that.\", Technically, candidates cant coordinate with their super PACs, but the restriction is all but ignored. Bush is reportedly planning to use his super PAC to conduct operations that had traditionally been handled by candidate campaigns. The Wild West nature of campaign finance would undoubtedly have a similar effect on the Democratic side if Hillary Clinton were facing a serious challenge. As it is, the anything-goes fund-raising of Clinton and her husband has become a problem for the Democratic front-runner. In recent days, her campaign has been dogged by reports that the Clinton Foundation took money from foreign governments and entities that stood to benefit from decisions made by Hillary Clintons State Department. The foundation admits it didnt account for the contributions properly in tax filings. And as the Posts Rosalind Helderman reported, many donors to the foundation also paid Bill Clinton to give speeches - enriching the Clintons personally. But Republicans, before they can exploit Hillary Clintons financial vulnerabilities in the general election, have to resolve a predicament in their primaries that once would have seemed enviable: Is it possible to raise too much money? As the likes of the Kochs and Adelsons sponsor candidates the way Medicis patronized Renaissance artists, theres a real chance that voters, particularly in early primary states, will lose their traditional ability to shape the field. Thanks to the Roberts court, the sacred concept of one man, one vote has been replaced by a new reality: one billionaire, one ballot.

{"Content": "[In a private meeting recently with 200 of the Democratic Partys top financiers, Hillary Clinton drew vigorous applause when she said any of her nominees to the Supreme Court would have to share her desire to overturn the Citizens United decision. Clinton also, as reported by my Washington Post colleagues Matea Gold and Anne Gearan, put in a plug with the fund-raisers (all of whom had hauled in at least $27,000 for her) for a constitutional amendment overturning the ruling, which allows unlimited spending by super PACs. Nice sentiments, but the fact that she was unveiling her Citizens United litmus test with party fat cats at an exclusive soiree (four days later, she mentioned it to voters in Iowa) tells you all you need to know about Clintons awkward - and often hypocritical - relationship with campaign-finance reform. Even as she denounces super PACs, shes counting on two of them, Priorities USA Action and Correct the Record, to support her candidacy - a necessary evil, her campaign says. Shes also chin-deep in questionable financial activities, ranging from the soft-money scandals of her husbands presidency to the current flap over contributions by foreigners and favor-seekers to the Clinton Foundation. Then theres the matter of her plans to continue President Obamas policy of opting out of the public-finance system; Obamas abandonment of the system did as much as the Citizens United ruling to destroy the post-Watergate fixes. Her advisers claim campaign-finance reforms will be at the top of her agenda, a sensible choice because of the deep resentment in the populace toward a political system rigged in favor of the wealthy. But she gives supporters little evidence that shes genuine. Asked by the Washington Post last month about the role of the pro-Clinton Priorities USA Action, Clinton shrugged her shoulders and said, \"I dont know.\", If she really thinks money is corrupting politics, she can take concrete steps right now. She could pledge to return immediately to the public-finance system and call on pro-Clinton super PACs to cease and desist - if her Republican opponents will do the same. The Republicans wont, of course, but then Clinton would have gained the moral high ground she now lacks. She could also vow to enact four pieces of legislation if elected: reviving the public-finance system with matching funds for small contributions; curtailing candidate super PACs by drafting strict rules prohibiting coordination; forcing the disclosure of anonymous \"dark money\" contributions; and creating a new enforcement agency to replace the impotent and perpetually deadlocked Federal Election Commission. \"We have a history of candidates making commitments to campaign-finance reform during the campaign and then walking away from it, in particular with Bill Clinton and Barack Obama,\" says Fred Wertheimer, a longtime campaign-finance reformer. \"Were going to need a lot more than what Mrs. Clinton has said in order for this to be treated seriously.\", Theres a chance shell find some Republican support for legislation to restore public financing of elections - if only because the absence of such a system effectively means presidents are elected to eight-year terms, because their ability to raise virtually unlimited sums as incumbents all but guarantees reelection. Stuart Stevens, who ran Mitt Romneys 2012 campaign, notes that only one incumbent president in the past 125 years who was not in the public-finance system lost his bid for reelection - Herbert Hoover. Stevens says the 2016 winner, Democrat or Republican, \"is going to be almost impossible to defeat\" in 2020. (Super PACs wont completely offset that incumbent advantage, he figures, because the funds are at least theoretically outside the candidates control.) The prospect of a de facto eight-year term for a Democratic president could persuade Republicans to support a revival of public finance even if it isnt \"normally in their DNA,\" Stevens argues. If shes serious in her commitment to campaign-finance reform, Clinton doesnt have to wait until the election. Stevens suggests she challenge her opponents to join her in opting into the moribund public-finance system (though its matching funds would be absurdly low). To keep the super PACs from filling the void, she could propose that both sides disavow them, as Republican Scott Brown and Democrat Elizabeth Warren did in their 2012 Massachusetts Senate race, pledging to pay a penalty if outside groups ran ads in their race. Such an arrangement is probably unworkable, even if Republicans took her up on it. But this and other tangible steps could reduce the demoralizing gap between Clintons professed commitment to clean elections and her dubious record.

{"Content": "[A federal lawsuit with that goal has been filed against the Federal Election Commission. A cochair of the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) expressed openness to the inclusion of third-party candidates. Trumpnado. Right now, to participate in the debates, a candidate must be polling above 15 percent nationally just before they commence. No third-party candidate has shared the stage with the Republican and Democratic nominee since Ross Perot in 1992, and Perot himself could not have met that threshold, which was implemented in 2000. (Perot was polling below 10 percent when he was admitted by acquiescence of the political parties.) Any change to the 15 percent rule would have to come from the CPD. Several constituencies would like to see that change. Perhaps none better organized and funded than ChangetheRule.org, a group of 50 prominent Americans, including Sen. Angus King (I. Maine); former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. a Republican; and former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, a Democrat. Their goal is to make the two major-party candidates defend their positions against the middle, especially as, according to a January Gallup survey, 43 percent of Americans (an all-time high) view themselves as politically independent. Peter Ackerman, a successful businessman who cofounded FreshDirect, is a force behind the effort to expand debate participation by changing the 15 percent rule. In 2012, he spearheaded an effort called Americans Elect, which sought to create a national online primary to nominate a \"balanced coalition ticket.\" While Ackerman succeeded in gaining ballot access, his effort fell short when no candidate received the minimum 5,000 support clicks. \"The rule that was designed by the Democrats and Republicans is impossible to hurdle,\" he said. He sees the current situation as an electoral Catch-22: If you cant get in the debates, youre not going to be a legitimate candidate; if youre not a legitimate candidate, you cant get into the debates. \"The key element of reform here is moving the designation date from 50 days to six months, and to basically allow the American people to get to know an independent candidate who competed hard for that single position,\" Ackerman said. His current proposal: Anyone who can get on enough state ballots to collectively total 270 Electoral College votes by April 30 will have his or her name placed into a national, independent presidential primary, Americas Primary, featuring a series of five debates with knockout rounds that the American people can vote on via the Internet to determine a winner. \"There are amazing Americans out there,\" he said. \"People who have gone through pinnacles of business, military, universities, unions, who simply will not run because they are excluded from getting any legitimacy because the debate rules dont give them legitimacy except with 50 days to go.\", Meanwhile, as Ackerman lobbies the CPD for change, Alexandra Shapiro, a former U.S. Supreme Court clerk now representing Level the Playing Field (formerly Americans Elect), has filed a lawsuit against the FEC seeking to have it force the CPD to perform its stated \"nonpartisan\" mission and use \"objective criteria to decide who can participate in debates.\", Paying close attention to these machinations is Frank Fahrenkopf, former chairman of the Republican National Committee who is the Republican cochair of the CPD. \"Theres no question the American people are unhappy with both political parties,\" Fahrenkopf concedes. \"Theyre unhappy with the whole political environment, and they want change. If theres 43 percent who are independents, theyre going to be looking at [Ackermans] plan and if he can put it together.\", The 15 percent rule, he said, is something the CPD adopted from the League of Women Voters. \"We look at it every four years to see whether or not there should be modifications,\" he said. \"No decision has been made on whether were going to stay at 15 percent, were going to lower it, or eliminate it altogether. . . . Im not saying that were not going to do what they suggest, but those decisions havent been made and were taking them very seriously. . . . And, we will announce in advance of next years debates by at least one year.\", In defense of the current rule, Fahrenkopf questioned whether a candidate who is not at 15 percent by mid-September 2016 is really a serious candidate. \"Do you really have a realistic chance to become the president of the United States?\" he asks. \"Im not sure.\" And he takes umbrage with the idea that the CPD is acting in a partisan fashion. \"The commission is made up of some people who you know as Republican, some Democrats, and some independents - Mitch Daniels, former governor of Indiana; Charlie Gibson, former anchor of ABC World News Tonight; and Leon Panetta, former secretary of defense.\", Enter Donald Trump. On Wednesday, he told Kevin Cirilli of The Hill that a third-party run is within the realm of possibility if the RNC continues to act \"very foolish\" and \"not supportive.\" Ackerman notes that Trump will have to expand his appeal if he wants to gain access to the debate stage in the general. \"Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have pretty much the same amount of support in their parties,\" Ackerman said, \"and if you really dig down . . . its not so much only a source of support for them but also a protest vote against what the American people feel theyre being served up. . . . Now, if Trump or Sanders wants to come and participate in Americas Primary, they have to realize that once this is known to be a catalyst for the winner going into the presidential debates, it will attract a group of candidates that are attractive both to moderate Democrats and moderate Republicans, as well as independents.\", Pundits still debate whether Perot pulled more votes from George H.W. Bush than Bill Clinton in 1992, but there is no mystery as to the potential impact of Trump. Last week, an ABC News-Washington Post poll showed that, in a head-to-head matchup, Hillary Clinton beats Jeb Bush, 51-41. But when Trumps name joins that mix, her 10-point lead jumps to 18 - Clinton 47, Bush 29, and Trump 19.

{"Content": "[Legal disclaimer: This column is for betting purposes only. What follows is analysis - scrubbed, as thoroughly as a Clinton server, of advocacy. (Unless I simply cant resist.), Hillary Clinton: Ever since her disastrous book-launch performance, Ive thought her both a weak candidate and the inevitable Democratic nominee. No longer. She has fallen from her 95 percent, barring-an-act-of-God perch. The e-mail imbroglio has already badly damaged her credibility. But now that shes lost control of the server, there is potential for further, conceivably fatal damage. It hinges largely on how successful she was in erasing the 32,000 e-mails she unilaterally deemed private. Odds: 1-3. Bernie Sanders: Fiery and genial, Sanders is the perfect protest candidate. But can a 73-year-old dairy-state Brooklynite socialist win? Of course not. If Hillary falls, Joe Biden fills the vacuum. Possibly even John Kerry. (Note to Dems: The beatified Jon Stewart is unemployed and at large.), , Meanwhile, in the GOP ... Donald Trump: Clear front-runner. Waiting for him to bring himself down? He wont. Hes impervious to the gaffe. In fact, he has a genius for turning a gaffe into a talking point, indeed, a rallying cry. Since the debate, his numbers have plateaued and in some places declined. In New Hampshire, for example, hes gone from the mid-20s to the high teens. And he had a rough debate, as reflected in the Suffolk University poll in Iowa taken right afterward, in which, 55-23, respondents felt less comfortable with the idea of Trump as president. Nonetheless, his core support, around 20 percent, remains solid. Which means Trump will likely continue to lead until the field whittles down to a handful, at which point 20 percent is no longer a plurality. Chances of winning his partys nomination? About the same as Sanders winning his. Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Marco Rubio: Still the top tier. Walker just held his own in the debate. Bush slipped slightly, appearing somewhat passive and, amazingly, still lacking a good answer to the \"brothers war\" question. But he continues steady, with a serious follow-up foreign policy speech and stick-to-his-guns positions on Common Core and immigration - not easy given the current mood of the party. Rubio had the best debate performance of the prime-time 10 - fluid, passionate, in command. And he was already No. 1 in the \"who could you support\" question (at 62 percent), crucial in a 17-member field. Odds for each? Rubio 3-1. Bush and Walker 4-1. Ted Cruz, John Kasich, Carly Fiorina: The new second tier. And rising. Cruz had a strong debate, establishing himself as the most convincing carrier of the populist, anti-Washington meme. Kasich was engaging and compelling as the bleeding-heart conservative and successful tough-guy governor. Not an easy trick. Fiorina displayed raw talent that surprised everyone who didnt know her - and six million watched. Articulate, knowledgeable, and relentlessly combative, she took on Clinton, Trump, and President Obama. Being in the undercard was a stroke of luck. She took the stage and made it her own. Odds? 9-1, but with high ceilings for each. Bonus Racing Form feature: the general election. Conventional wisdom is that the GOP is tearing itself apart and headed south. Whats becoming clear, however, is that the Democrats are equally split ideologically - Clinton desperately moving left as Sanders crowds grow - and increasingly nervous about her chronic, shall we say, character problem. Both parties limp into November 2016. Current odds? GOP: 55 percent. And note how thin is the Democrats bench. After Clinton, no one, while the GOP stage sports perhaps eight to 10 impressive, plausibly presidential figures, including (for those who count such things) two Hispanics, a female former Fortune 500 CEO, and an African American brain surgeon.

{"Content": "[ALMOST FOUR YEARS to the day after the launch of the Occupy Wall Street protests, the left is making remarkable strides on both sides of the Atlantic. In Canada, a left-wing party that barely registered at the dawn of the 21st century, the New Democratic Party is holding to its lead in the polls as our friendly neighbor to the north elects a new government next month, putting NDP leader Thomas Mulcair in the drivers seat. If he wins, Mulcair will surely kill the Keystone XL project at the source, throw a monkey wrench into the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, and raise taxes on corporations to fund social programs. Here at home, \"democratic socialist\" Sen. Bernie Sanders continues to draw surprisingly large crowds, even in bastions of the old Confederacy, and is actually widening his lead over \"liberalism lite\" Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire and Iowa, as a growing number of Democrats grasp for the real thing, a candidate they know will zealously attack the power of large corporations and the political influence of the top 1 Percent. Most importantly, look across the pond to the biggest story of the weekend, the ascension of far-left, longtime gadfly Jeremy Corbyn to become the leader of the United Kingdoms Labour Party, which puts Corbyn in line to challenge their Conservative prime minister, David Cameron, when the next election is held in the spring of 2020. Corbyns takeover of the party that not long ago gave the world Iraq War hawk Tony Blair went from improbable to inevitable, and it brought a lot of Chicken Little sky-is-falling clucking from Cameron, Blair and from well-fed armchair pundits everywhere. This so-called wild-eyed radical Corbyn published his views in an op-ed in the Guardian newspaper after his section on Saturday - he ripped ISIS and Syrian President Assad but also called for an end to assaults on the Bahraini democracy movement; on the economy, he called for investing in infrastructure and in energy solutions. \"You cant cut your way to prosperity, you have to build it,\" Corbyn said. That is what the punditocracy calls \"crazy talk\"? If thats the case, Ill happily live out the rest of my life in the insane asylum with Corbyn in charge. But then, the glass is still only half full for the left. Of the three, only Canadas Mulcair has a better than 50 percent chance to actually lead at this point. In the case of Sanders, while he continues to astonish, his real feat may end up as pushing the eventual Democratic nominee toward a purer shade of liberalism. Corbyn sure seems like a longshot to ever lead England. What these men share is that theyve moved the entire political discussion toward the left side of the highway, so that things like a liveable wage for the working poor, an end to mass incarceration or over-dependence on fossil fuels now seem possible in a way that was unimaginable in the 2000s. But theres also a flip side. Voters all over the world are on the move - but not always to the left. Across Western society, from the ends of Eastern Europe to the Iowa caucuses, xenophobic anti-immigrant candidates are gaining strength. Overseas, right-wing parties railing against immigration are plucking voters from the dead and decaying center, in some places more rapidly than the rival left-wing parties are growing. The prime minister of Hungary who wants to keep out refugees who arent Christian is just a stones throw, politically and morally, from Donald Trump calling Mexican arrivals \"rapists\" and promising an unprecedented diaspora of 11 million undocumented immigrant families. Whats odd is that the parties on the far left and the parties on the far right are, in one sense, reacting to the same thing: the utter failures of 20th-century-style capitalism. The difference is simply a matter of whom to blame for harsh austerity policies in Europe, for stagnant wages and middle-aged, middle-class folks forced from the job market here in the U.S. Liberals see the centrists as too cozy with the billionaire class, doling out tax breaks at the expense of the middle, while folks on the right think the politicians have allowed runaway immigration to lower labor costs for big business (or give more votes to the Democrats). Liberals want to blame the billionaires, while conservatives want to blame the folks who were forced to become migrants by economic inequality or military adventurism. One of those things makes more sense to me. But one thing its hard to disagree with: 2015 will be remembered as the year the political center died. Which means that 2016 may be the most interesting year - and the most fraught with peril - of any political season weve seen in our lifetimes. ]", "Date": "20150915", "Title": "[THE LEFT LIVENS UP]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/columnists/20150915_THE_LEFT_LIVENS_UP.html\n", "Author": "[Will Bunch ]"}

{"Content": "[Voters appear ready to end marijuana prohibition but politicians are slow to act. Two polls released today show a significant upward trend favoring marijuana legalization among Pennsylvania and New Jersey residents. A Franklin & Marshall pollshowed that a staggering 87 percent of Pa residents approve of medical marijuana. Although support has been above 80 percent in several polls since 2009, this is the highest number to date. Few issues have ever seen this massive level of public backing. \"It is pretty rare where most voters agree on something,\" F&M poll director and political science professor G. Terry Madonna told Philly420, \"We have been consistently asking the question about doctors recommending [medical] marijuana. Overall there has been a generic increase in support.\", A measure to legalize cannabis oils, tinctures and other products for people with certain conditions passed the Pa. Senate earlier this year. But the bill has now stalled in the House. SB3 would not allow patients to smoke marijuana and only allows vaporization for three conditions. Still, the very limited measure has been stopped by State Rep. Matt Baker (R-Tioga) the chairman of the House Health Committee. While there is significant bi-partisan support among legislators Baker has remained firm in his decision not to bring the bill up for a vote. House members have a few options left before the session expires in 2016. They can craft a different bill or petition the majority leadership for a change of committee. The question now is if Pa will make history as the first state to reach 100 percent support in a poll without passing a medical marijuana bill. The more significant news from the F&M poll was a big jump in support for fully legal, recreational marijuana. The survey found 40% of Pa voters now want regulated cannabis. That is a 5 percent jump in one year, the biggest single-year rise in recent data. The number has almost doubled from a decade ago; in 2006 just 22 percent of Pa voters favored taxing and selling the plant. \"This fits the national trend,\" said Madonna, \"And this is heavily driven bymillennials, there is a big disparity by age. Millennials much more likely to support legalization than seniors. Remember that Pennsylvania has the 4th largest senior population in the country.\", There are about 18,000 marijuana possession arrests each year in Pennsylvania. Most of those arrests are residents 18-35 years old. Philadelphia decriminalized possession of up to 30 grams last fall making the offense punishable with a $25 civil citation. Pennsylvanias current underground marijuana economy could be worth more than $2 billion every year. If treated like booze and beer, legal weed could bring in more than $500 million in annual taxes for the Keystone State. Across the river in New Jersey a Rutgers-Eagleton poll also released today showed an even more dramatic shift in favor of legal cannabis. That poll found that a majority of N.J. voters, 58 percent, want marijuana treated like alcohol. The poll was commissioned by the Drug Policy Alliance. \"Support for legalization in New Jersey is growing, which mirrors national polls, said David Redlawsk, director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling and professor of political science at Rutgers University. \"By asking a question that makes clear legalization for adults 21 and over would come with taxes and regulation, we provided context that may account for some of the 9-point jump in support from our April 2014 poll. Even so, no matter how the question is asked, we have been seeing a long-term upward trend in favor of marijuana legalization among New Jerseyans.\", There are more than 22,000 marijuana possession arrests each year in New Jersey. A group called N.J. United for Marijuana Reform launched an effort earlier this year to end local prohibition. NJUMR includes NORML, NAACP and even the Municipal Prosecutors Association. New Jersey and Pennsylvania do not have direct-to-law ballot initiatives like Colorado or even Washington DC. That means voters cannot change the policy during an election. The two states are reliant on the legislative process and politicians to enact reform. There are bills active in both states that would fully legalize cannabis, but neither has even had a committee hearing. Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Colorado and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for adults through the direct ballot process. Retail outlets and taxes are employed in AK, OR, WA and CO. Small plots for home cultivation are also permitted. In D.C. there are no cannabis shops but residents are allowed to grow up to six plants in their home. The pressure is certainly building on state politicians to act on the issue. Local residents have become much more vocal about the topic. Many are tired of seeing friends and family suffer criminal consequences and having their freedom defined by state lines. No state legislature has taken the step for legal pot yet. But with such strong support our region could be prime to make the move into a new era of personal liberty and the new, green economy.

{"Content": "[While marijuana consumers are enjoying an open retail market in Washington and Colorado the race is on for the first state on the East Coast to end prohibition. Massachusetts this week certified four competing marijuana petitioners to begin gathering signatures in the Bay State. The goal is to put the issue of full legalization before voters in 2016. Massachusetts residents have already approved statewide decriminalization and medical marijuana. U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren weighed in on the topic earlier this week adding momentum to the issue. In a discussion with reporter Joshua Miller from the Boston Globe that touched on a wide range of topics, Warren was asked her opinion as a voter. You were opposed to legalization in 2012, Miller said to Warren. As a Massachusetts voter, whats your position today?  Warren said that she is more receptive to the notion of legalization now. Im open to it, she told Miller. I think weve learned more.  A couple of states have legalized marijuana for recreational use. Frankly, I think we ought to be learning what we can from those states, she said. Wicked. Warren is best known for her fiery speeches in committees and on the Senate floor for holding Wall Street accountable for economic inequality and championing womens rights and provisions to protect workers. Some observers have hinted that Warren might be a contender for a spot as Vice President on the Democratic ticket during the 2016 election. To the south, signatures are being gathered in Florida for a ballot initiative in 2016 to regulate cannabis.Floridians For Freedom is hitting the streets to begin the process to gain ballot approval. At the same time , a group called United For Care is trying again for a comprehensive medical marijuana bill in Florida. A similar ballot initiative by the same group was narrowly defeated last year. Because the United For Care plan calls for an amendment to the state constitution it will take 60 percent of voters saying \"yes\" to pass. Not all states have a ballot process to change laws. Vermont could be the first state in the nation do make the shift through their legislature. Earlier this year, the RAND Corporation released a comprehensive report on the possibilities for The Green Mountain State regulating cannabis. The report was created because Vermont passed a bill to study the subject. When the RAND report went public, Vermont Gov. Pete Shumlin said,I continue to support moves to legalize marijuana in Vermont but have always said that we have to proceed with rigorous research and preparation before deciding whether to act. This report will help us do that. The issue gained more steam earlier this month when Vermonts House Speaker, Rep. Shep Smith, told Vermont Public Radio, I will support a bill to legalize marijuana if we make sure that we have very strong protections for people who are driving under the influence, to make sure that we can prosecute them, and as long as we make sure that we have laws that keep marijuana out of the hands of kids. The entire population of Vermont at just over 626,000 is about one third the population of Philadelphia. But as RAND describes \"Vermonters likely consumed between 15 and 25 metric tons of marijuana and spent between $125 million and $225 million on marijuana in 2014.\", Impressive. Washington D.C. voters approved legalization last year. It has been a quiet success story. Yet there are no retail cannabis stores in the nations capitol. The Districts unique measure only allowed growing at home. Though one does wonder how many Congressional staffers have a new gardening hobby. Meanwhile the topic remains almost taboo in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Legalization bills have technically been introduced in both states but have received no committee hearings, co-sponsors or momentum. The bill for Pa. looks to put cannabis alongside alcohol in the state run wine and spirits stores. The Garden State bill would allow a more free market approach. For Pennsylvania and New Jersey, the question remains. Will voters and politicians idly watch as additional states reap the tax revenue rewards after relaxing marijuana laws?, Chris Goldstein is associate editor of Freedom Leaf magazine and co-chair of PhillyNorml.

{"Content": "[By Brian Steinberg, LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - When Stephen Colbert holds forth at New Yorks Ed Sullivan Theater later this afternoon for his first taping at the helm of CBS \"Late Show,\" he will no doubt do something, maybe even many things, that will make people chuckle. Behind the scenes, however, its not clear that executives at CBS - or any other network that has invested in a late-night program in recent months - have much cause to smile. On TV, late-night has always been a place for funny business, whether it be Johnny Carsons Art Fern or David Lettermans Alka-Seltzer suit. Now, after Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon and a cadre of new hosts with no direct ties to the genres landmark Carson era have hit upon new methods to make the shows resonate, the entire enterprise of the time-slot has grown exponentially more serious. TVs primetime schedule usually draws the most notice, but as Colbert debuts on CBS around 11:35 p.m. this evening, it is late-night that has perhaps become the most competitive time slot on TV. See More:Advertisers Rush To Latenight To Catch Colbert, Fallon, Kimmel, In the last week, Walt Disneys ESPN and Time Warners TBS have used the spotlight accorded the new CBS host to boost their own wee-hours projects - a midnight \"SportsCenter\" that started Monday and a new late-night series launching in January hosted by Samantha Bee. To push back against an initial \"Late Show\" roster jammed full of politicians and statesmen, NBC has over the last several weeks booked Donald Trump, Jeb Bush and Chris Christie to appear on Jimmy Fallons \"Tonight Show.\" Meanwhile, Seth Meyers is quietly reworking his \"Late Night\" to be the NBC yin to Fallons yang: Meyers is booking more authors and intelligentsia and has altered the shows opening segment to emulate his tenure behind the \"Weekend Update\" desk on \"Saturday Night Live.\" Comedy Central will put a new face, Trevor Noah, behind its \"Daily Show\" desk in just three weeks time. And lest viewers forget about new options, Netflix has begun touting its new on-demand talk-show series featuring Chelsea Handler, slated to debut next year. At stake is a new way to reach the young consumers that TV advertisers covet. Who knows whether anyone will send a snippet of the new NBC drama \"Blindspot\" richocheting around Periscope in a few weeks time? You can rest assured, however, that many people will share whatever Jimmy Fallon cooks up the same night. Ad-buying executives know that some of the late-night programs grab a greater number of viewers between the ages of 18 and 49 each night than some of their primetime counterparts. When each hosts digital pass-along is added to the brew, their potential to help lasso people to attend a new movie, buy a new cereal or drink a new beer only grows. Little wonder, then, that late-night ad prices this year rose by a greater percentage than those for primetime TV. And there is turf up for grabs. NBCs \"Tonight\" and \"Late Night\" win significantly more ad dollars than CBS nighttime offerings. More important, perhaps, is the glaring absence of Jon Stewart during the time period. No one considered Johnny Carson, Jay Leno or David Letterman the equivalent of a Walter Cronkite. For some viewers, however, Stewart had that accord. The rising generation gets more of its news through satire and humor, which is why HBOs \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\" continues to win comparisons to \"60 Minutes.\" Attention is already focused on the 2016 election for U.S. President, and several of the late-night hosts seem to be making a bid to gain some of the light that reflected off Stewarts halo. See More:CBS Moves Fast to Win New Ads for James Corden, Stephen Colbert, Colberts early \"Late Show\" days will feature a visit from Justice Stephen Breyer, a pairing of Carol Burnett with \"Broad City\" stars Abbi Jacboson and Ilana Glazer; and a talk with United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon. Its a different sort of mainstream late-night program, the kind that convenes guests from broader walks of life, almost in recognition that the nation has grown very weary of seeing actors and actresses hype their latest project and go on their merry way. Just as the networks morning show, \"CBS This Morning,\" has brought ratings gains in that time slot by not trying to emulate its competition, so too does CBS seem to be aiming for broader acceptance around midnight by charting a different path. With Colbert, CBS also has a chance to strike a new imprimatur for the genre. Late-night already has a guy who can get celebrities to do outrageous things (Jimmy Fallon); a host who can produce hilarious videos and play the mischievous imp (Jimmy Kimmel); a fellow who can say things about race and culture many would fear to utter (Larry Wilmore), and an elder statesman of sorts who has seen a lot and has the authority to do the show he likes (Conan OBrien). What it doesnt have as of yet is a person who is adept at delving into different areas of culture and can still make it all seem interesting and fun. Success isnt guaranteed. In the last year, even the most unlikely candidates have dipped into the late-night game. National Geographic Channel launched astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson into a weekly late-night talk show centered on discussions of science and popular culture. Viacoms CMT enlisted comedian Josh Wolf to lead a four-nights-a-week effort that runs into the weekend. If Colbert isnt distinct enough from the rest of the crowd, he risks adding another noise to the cacophony, instead of being heard above the din. CBS is counting on him to make a greater splash, just as Comcast, Walt Disney, Time Warner and Viacom depend on their horses in this race. There are video-on-demand deals to be written and international syndication pacts to be gained. NBCU, part of Comcast, is likely to include Fallons stunts in a new subscription video-on-demand product scheduled to debut later this year. If only the late-night job was to craft a few monologue zingers and send viewers off to sleep, as it was in Carsons day. To win, Colbert will have to tweet, post, stream and joke his way into audiences hearts. No other kind of entertainment-based program has the potential to be so broadly relevant nearly every day, even when the show is off the air. And thats the secret about this new and frenzied era of late-night programs and the hosts behind all of them: They make us laugh, but the work involved in doing so has become so intense that few of the people involved have much time to even crack a grin.]", "Date": "20150908", "Title": "[As Stephen Colbert Takes Stage, Late-Night TV Is Nothing to Laugh About]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/television/20150908_Reuters_MT1VRT1201587669_As_Stephen_Colbert_Takes_Stage__Late_Night_TV_Is_Nothing_to_Laugh_About.html\n", "Author": "[Brian Steinberg, Variety Media, LLC]"}
{"Content": "[WASHINGTON (AP) - Looking at the big picture, the financial health of Social Security and Medicare doesnt appear to have worsened. Wednesdays annual check-up found that Social Securitys retirement trust fund has enough money to pay full benefits until 2035, a year later than previously projected. Medicares giant trust fund for inpatient care wont be exhausted until 2030, the same date as last years report. But below those reassuring projections, program trustees said theres cause for concern. Some 11 million people who receive Social Security disability face steep benefit cuts next year - unless Congress acts. Medicares outpatient premium could go up dramatically for a subset of beneficiaries - about 7.5 million people. And they warned that the time is now to make changes in the long-term financing of both programs, when benefit cuts and tax increases can be phased in gradually. ___, Here are five things you need to know about the 2015 Social Security and Medicare trustees reports:, ALARMS FOR DISABILITY PROGRAM, The disability trust fund is expected to run out of money late next year, right in the middle of a presidential election. That would trigger an automatic 19 percent cut in benefits. The average monthly benefit for disabled workers and their families is $1,017. That means the typical beneficiary would see their benefits reduced by $193 a month. The report said the \"urgent threat\" of insolvency requires prompt action by Congress. There is an easy fix available: Congress could shift tax revenue from Social Securitys much larger retirement fund, as it has done in the past. President Barack Obama supports the move. But Republicans say they want changes in the program to reduce fraud and to encourage disabled workers to re-enter the work force. COST-OF-LIVING INCREASE UNLIKELY, Unlike most private pensions, Social Security benefits have built-in inflation protection. The average Social Security check is $1,220 a month, and beneficiaries count on their annual cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to preserve the purchasing power of their benefits. But the trustees projected there will be no COLA at the end of this year. It would mark only the third year without an increase since automatic adjustments were adopted in 1975. Things could change before the end of the year. Program economists are constantly crunching numbers to track fluctuating prices. But if theres no adjustment for 2016, some people will face dramatically higher Medicare premiums. MEDICARE PREMIUMS SPIKE?, Some beneficiaries may face steep premium increases for Medicare Part B, which provides coverage for outpatient services. For about 70 percent of beneficiaries, premium increases cannot exceed the dollar amount of their Social Security cost-of-living adjustment. Because no COLA is currently expected for 2016, increased costs of outpatient coverage would have to be spread among the remaining 30 percent. That would result in an increase of about $54 in the base premium, bringing it to $159.30 a month. It works out to paying 52 percent more. Those who would feel the impact include 2.8 million new beneficiaries, 1.6 million who pay the premium directly instead of having it deducted from their Social Security, and 3.1 million upper income beneficiaries, those making at least $85,000 for an individual and $170,000 for a married couple. The increases for upper-income beneficiaries would be higher, up to $174 a month for those in the highest bracket. State budgets would also take a hit, because states pay the Part B premium for low-income beneficiaries who have dual Medicare and Medicaid coverage. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell said no final decision has been made, and that premium increases are expected to average less than 5 percent a year over the long run. PRICE OF POSTPONEMENT, Every year the Social Security and Medicare trustees deliver a sober warning: neither program is adequately financed for the long haul. That means some combination of benefit cuts, tax increases, or in Medicares case, reining in health care costs, is needed to keep the programs in balance. \"Dont focus on the date of trust fund depletion,\" trustee Robert Reischauer admonished reporters. \"Under current law, both of these vitally important programs are on a financially unsustainable path.\" An economist, Reischauer is one of two so-called \"public\" trustees. The other four are high-ranking administration officials. His fellow public trustee, economist Charles Blahous, said the travails of the disability program should be a lesson to all. \"The last thing we need is continual delay,\" he said. Reischauer is a Democrat and Blahous is a Republican. THE BASICS, Nearly 60 million people receive Social Security benefits, including 42 million retired workers and dependents, 11 million disabled workers and 6 million survivors of deceased workers. About 55 million retirees and disabled people get Medicare. The hospital trust fund is only part of the program. Coverage for outpatient care and prescription drugs is covered by premiums and other government spending. Medicare is adding 10,000 new beneficiaries a day as baby boomers reach age 65. The administration officials serving as Medicare and Social Security trustees are the secretaries of the Treasury, Health and Human Services, and Labor departments, as well as the Social Security commissioner. The trustees provide oversight of the programs finances. ___, Follow Stephen Ohlemacher on Twitter: http://twitter.com/stephenatap]", "Date": "20150727", "Title": "[5 things from annual check-up for Social Security, Medicare]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/health/healthcare-exchange/20150723_ap_83dbfc28b0a54e5ba597412b5f89d87f.html\n", "Author": "[RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR and STEPHEN OHLEMACHER, The Associated Press]"}

{"Content": "[LYNCHBURG, Va. - Sen. Ted Cruz said Monday that he will win his long-shot campaign for president in the same way he won his long-shot bid for Senate in 2010: outhustle his rivals from the party establishment and electrify voters with his message of Christian morals and undiluted conservatism. \"The only way we win this race and - more importantly than that - the only way we turn the country around is if we energize and mobilize an army of courageous conservatives,\" Cruz said in an interview with the Washington Post. \"The core of this campaign will be at the grass roots,\" he said. Cruz (R. Texas) spoke just an hour after he announced his candidacy at Liberty University before a cheering crowd of students who, as it turned out, would have faced a $10 fine if they hadnt shown up to the event, part of a regular campus attendance requirement. Cruz, 44, was the first prominent Republican formally to enter the 2016 race, which could give him a head start on other candidates still playing at \"exploring\" a run. At least at the start, he will be running from behind. Polls in early-primary states put Cruz outside the top five - and, in some cases, outside the top 10 - in the GOP field. But the senator said he had overcome longer odds in Texas, where he surged from obscurity to defeat a well-funded establishment candidate. In this race, Cruz told the Post, he would rely heavily on family members as surrogates. He said his wife, Heidi, who plans to take a leave from her job as a managing director at Goldman Sachs, would play an \"integral\" part in his campaign. Heidi Cruzs role would include \"traveling with me, traveling on her own across the country, and working to help build support,\" Cruz said. So will his father, Rafael Cruz, an immigrant from Cuba who is now an evangelical pastor. Ted Cruz bristled when asked about criticism of his father, who has previously compared President Obama to Fidel Castro and said that same-sex marriage is part of a government plot to destroy the family and \"the concept of God.\", Ted Cruz said Democrats and journalists \"try to paint a false picture of my dad.\", \"I love my dad,\" Cruz said. \"He is my hero and he is a man of principle, a man of faith, and I think the media efforts to caricature him are just silly and mean-spirited, and I dont think theyll work because theyre fundamentally false.\", Now the Texas Republican will hit the road, attempting to mimic the exhausting and wide-ranging outreach campaign that he made across Texas. After his morning event, Cruz left Virginia for New York, where he met donors at the home of GOP donor Rebekah Mercer. On Wednesday, he will attend a \"Young Professionals for Cruz\" gathering in New York. After that, he plans to visit nine cities in a month, with fund-raisers in Houston, San Diego, Chicago, Dallas, and Champaign, Ill. According to aides, Cruzs campaign wants to raise $1 million during the first week of his candidacy and a total of $40 million to $50 million for the primary. He will also be reaching out to voters in key early-primary states such as New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada, and Colorado. He will start in New Hampshire on Friday and Saturday, becoming the first major candidate to visit the state in this election cycle after officially jumping into the fray. Cruz will end the month by formally opening his campaign headquarters March 31 in Houston - the city where he grew up. Cruzs strategy will be to build on a base of support he has cultivated since 2010, impressing tea party-affiliated conservatives with strong stands against Obama and the presidents health-care law. The idea is that this hard core of supporters can convert others. \"If you own a base, then you can grow,\" an adviser to Cruz said on Monday. On Monday, Cruz signaled his strategy in both the content - and the location - of his formal announcement speech. By announcing his candidacy at Liberty, the university founded by fundamentalist icon Jerry Falwell, he sent a message that he would court both evangelical voters and young voters. The youthful spirit of the crowd gathered for a mandatory campuswide \"convocation\" was obvious during Cruzs speech. They cheered everything from Cruzs mention of their home states to his nods to conservative dreams like abolishing the IRS. The speech itself embraced the goals of Christian social conservatives, military hawks, and small-government tea partyers - all key elements of the coalition that Cruz is looking to build. He provided grist for movement stalwarts by highlighting examples of his unbending conservatism. He talked about the power of the American dream and harnessing the grass roots to propel his campaign forward. \"I want to talk to you this morning about reigniting the promise of America,\" he said. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas became the first high-profile Republican to enter the 2016 race for president on Monday. Heres a look at his life:, A man in a hurry, He won election to the Senate in 2012 as a political rookie, riding a tea party wave to upset a candidate with decades of experience and deep connections inside the Republican Party. He has proceeded since with the same disregard for the GOP establishment, at times maneuvering quixotically in the Senate to mount an aggressive opposition to President Obama. Legal eagle, Prior to his election to the Senate, Cruz focused on practicing law at the highest level. A graduate of Harvard Law School and clerk for Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist, Cruz led a Houston-based firms Supreme Court practice, taught such litigation at the University of Texas, and was charged with representing the state before the high court as its solicitor general. Family story, The son of a Cuban immigrant and American mother, Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta, on Dec. 22, 1970, while his parents were working in the oil business. He has since renounced his Canadian citizenship, and lawyers from both parties have said they think hes eligible to run for president. He and his wife, Heidi, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, live in Houston with their two daughters, Caroline and Catherine. Senate marathon, For 21 hours and 19 minutes in September 2013, Cruz stood in the Senate to urge Congress to cut off money for Obamas health-care law. The marathon speech, which included Cruzs reading of the Dr. Seuss classic Green Eggs and Ham to his daughters, said to be watching their father at home, was partly behind a 16-day partial government shutdown the next month. He later joked the speech featured hours of \"my favorite sound\" - his own voice. - AP,  ]", "Date": "20150324", "Title": "[Cruz officially announces run for president]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20150324_Cruz_officially_announces_run_for_president.html\n", "Author": "[Katie Zezima and David A.

{"Content": "[LOUISVILLE, Ky. - Sen. Rand Paul, the maverick first-term senator who rode a tea party wave from a Kentucky ophthalmology practice to Congress, made a vigorous appeal Tuesday to conservatives angry with both parties as he entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination. Unveiling his campaign at a hotel ballroom here, Paul offered himself as a singular voice and fresh-faced disrupter of the entrenched political order. Pauls appeal was rooted in part in the purist libertarian plank championed for decades by his father, former Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul. But the senator also seeks to move beyond his fathers base by stitching together a nontraditional coalition among disparate blocs of voters who share frustration with the federal governments role in their lives, whether evangelicals, tea party activists, or tech-savvy millennials. Paul pledged to be a combative envoy in a crowded and competitive GOP field that is likely to feature at least a half-dozen serious candidates. \"I have a message, a message that is loud and clear and does not mince words: We have come to take our country back,\" Paul thundered at the start of his 30-minute, populist-heavy speech. \"We have come to take our country back from the special interests that use Washington as their personal piggy bank.\", Flanked by American flags, Paul, 52, emphasized inclusion for a party that has struggled to adapt to national demographic changes. While the setting was one of a classic launch - a dark-suited, flag-pin-wearing senator speaking on a ballroom stage - Paul said he would reach out to all Americans who have tuned out of the political process and have become weary of partisanship. Paul fleshed out pillars of his emerging, eclectic platform: amending the Constitution to require a balanced federal budget and congressional term limits, offering \"school choice\" for students, spending more on infrastructure, and repealing \"any law that disproportionately incarcerates people of color.\", \"The message of liberty, opportunity, and justice is for all Americans, whether you wear a suit, a uniform, or overalls, whether youre white or black, rich or poor,\" Paul said. \"Many Americans, though, are being left behind. The reward of work seems beyond their grasp. Under the watch of both parties, the poor seem to get poorer, and the rich get richer.\", But this amalgam of ideas makes Paul a potent threat to the rest of the GOP field. Paul comes from the dovish wing of the Republican Party and is reluctant to meddle in foreign affairs unnecessarily. He bashes Republicans and Democrats with impunity, telling the crowd here that he blames both blocs and the political system for the loss of opportunity. And he rails against corporate influence in a party that is dominated by business. Pauls likely rivals are carving out their own primary profiles. Several conservative contenders are actively working to prevent Paul from sewing together the coalition he seeks, in particular Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Cruz - who announced his campaign last month in front of thousands of young Christians at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va. - has also sought to portray himself as a Washington outsider and has made overtures to both libertarians and evangelicals. Defense hawks have reacted with particular alarm at the idea of Paul as the GOP nominee. A conservative advocacy group, the Foundation for a Secure and Prosperous America, released a television spot to air in early primary states this week that casts Paul as \"dangerous\" on international affairs and aligned with President Obama on nuclear negotiations with Iran. \"His problem is that his ambitions are in conflict with his actual principles,\" said John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in the Bush administration, who is mulling his own 2016 president bid. \"Many people who like Rand Paul on fiscal and economic issues are appalled by his views on national security and his lack of understanding.\", In his remarks, Paul said he was not an isolationist but a noninterventionist - supportive of the U.S. military forces, but reluctant to deploy them beyond a response to direct threats. He said his worldview was more akin to Ronald Reagan than George W. Bush, while also declaring that \"the enemy is radical Islam\" in current global conflicts. Paul also offered a vivid and forceful critique of the National Security Agencys surveillance policies during the Bush and Obama administrations. Holding up his smartphone and raising his voice, Paul decried \"this vast dragnet by executive order.\" As president, he said, \"I will immediately end this unconstitutional surveillance,\" drawing an enthusiastic response.

{"Content": "[In an address on the Capitol lawn, Sanders laid out an agenda that took aim at major conservative donors to Republican causes, but also landed subtle jabs on the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Rodham Clinton, a former secretary of state whose political ties to Wall Street have left some liberals yearning for an alternative. \"I dont believe that the men and women who defended American democracy fought to create a situation where billionaires own the political process,\" Sanders told reporters. \"Thats a huge issue.\" , He cited his opposition to the Iraq war, when he was a member of the House in 2002 and then-Sen. Clinton (N.Y.) supported the conflict, as well as his staunch opposition to an emerging trade deal with a dozen Pacific Rim nations that had its initial phases negotiated when Clinton served as the nations top diplomat. , \"The issue here is not the Clinton Foundation - thats a fair issue - the issue is the huge amount of money that it takes to run a campaign today,\" he said. The event was as unusual as Sanders, 73, with flowing white hair that evokes an image more in line with a New England professor than a presidential contender. Technically, Sanders had announced his candidacy in an e-mail to supporters earlier Thursday, so this was just a chance for him to lay out an agenda. He is the longest-serving independent in Congress, first winning a House seat in 1990 and refusing to formally join the Democratic Party, even as he caucused with Democrats in both chambers. Now seeking that partys highest calling, he rejected any sense that he would register with the party now. The contrast between Sanders and Clinton is stark, and his candidacy - especially his presence in the expected primary debates this fall - threatens to remind base Democrats why they may have pause supporting Clinton. The comparisons are plenty: Sanders authenticity and hot, unvarnished rhetoric to Clintons careful script; his unabashedly liberal agenda to her years of triangulation; his grassroots, small-donor campaign to her paid army of staffers and super-PAC allies. On Thursday afternoon, Clinton said via Twitter, \"I agree with Bernie. Focus must be on helping Americas middle class. GOP would hold them back. I welcome him to the race. - H.\" , Sanders has impressed liberal activists in his visits to early caucus and primary states. In South Carolina last weekend, he fired up delegates at the state Democratic Partys annual convention and drew a standing ovation with his impassioned assault on the \"billionaire class.\" He warned that the United States was becoming \"an oligarchic form of society.\" , With the media and many Democratic activists hungry for a competitive primary, Sanders is banking on gaining notice through the news media. The danger for Clinton is that, because of her dominance at the outset of the race, any surge by Sanders or another challenger in the polls could be interpreted as a sign that she was no longer the immutable, presumptive nominee. The Sanders campaign believes it can raise about $50 million to wage a credible primary campaign and fund TV ads in the early states. It expects much of that money to come online from the deep network of small-dollar donors Sanders has built over his years in the Senate. Sanders hopes to use his lack of a super PAC to his advantage, making the Citizens United court decision - which made it easier to spend unlimited funds on elections - a centerpiece of his populist message.

{"Content": "[Against a diverse tableau at a boisterous rally in the state he governed for eight years, Bush offered himself as a compassionate and tested chief executive who would fix a broken federal government and disrupt the countrys political brinkmanship. \"We will take Washington - the static capital of this dynamic country - out of the business of causing problems,\" he said. \"We will get back on the side of free enterprise and free people. I know we can fix this. Because Ive done it.\" , With his mother, former first lady Barbara Bush, sitting in the front row, Jeb Bush directly confronted the family history that is both an asset and a liability. His father and brother, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, were not present, but he invoked them by saying that he met his first president the day he was born and his second when he was taken home from the hospital. , \"Not a one of us deserves the job by right of resume, party, seniority, family, or family narrative,\" he said. \"Its nobodys turn. Its everybodys test, and its wide open - exactly as a contest for president should be.\" , Addressing hundreds of supporters inside a Miami college gymnasium, Bush spoke in aspirational terms about what he called a \"nation filled with charitable hearts.\" He seemed determined to present a new, welcoming face for the Republican Party, looking as much to the general election as to the primaries. He did not mention any GOP opponent by name, but he directly attacked Hillary Rodham Clinton, saying that the Democratic presidential front-runner sits atop \"a no-suspense primary, for a no-change election\" to succeed President Obama and would \"slog on with the same agenda under another name.\" , \"The presidency should not be passed on from one liberal to the next,\" he said. Bush, 62, focused heavily on his record as Floridas governor, the office he held between 1999 and 2007. Under his leadership, he said, the state led the nation in job creation, income growth, balanced budgets, and tax cuts. \"We dont need another president who merely holds the top spot among the pampered elites of Washington,\" he said. Later, he said, \"I was a reforming governor, not just another member of the club.\" , As president, he said, he would \"think big\" about overhauling the tax code, undo Obama-era federal regulations, and \"get serious about limited government.\" , Bush laid out an ambitious goal of 4 percent economic growth, which he said would bring 19 million new jobs. \"Its possible,\" he said. \"It can be done.\" , But he had nothing in his prepared remarks about immigration reform, an issue he has championed for years but that is particularly divisive for die-hard Republican base voters. Only when two dozen protesters stood in the rafters to interrupt him - they stripped off a layer of clothing to reveal neon T-shirts spelling out \"Legal status is not enough\" - did Bush weigh in on the subject. \"The next president of the United States will pass meaningful immigration reform,\" he said, departing from the text in his TelePrompTers. Mondays event was strikingly different from most Republican campaign rallies this year, which have drawn overwhelmingly white crowds. Bush spoke at a campus of Miami Dade College, a system that boasts the largest Hispanic student body in the nation, and packed the gymnasium with cheering Asian, black, and Latino supporters, young and old, who held up campaign signs in Spanish and English. Before Bush took the stage, a family of Cuban singers performed regional classics. A black Baptist minister called Bush \"a man of deep conviction.\" The Colombian mother of a disabled daughter defended his record, in Spanish. Bushs former lieutenant governor looked across the big crowd and said: \"It looks like family. The Bush family - the big Bush family.\" , Florida State Sen. Don Gaetz told the crowd that Bush is \"the new Florida. He is the new America. He is the new Republican Party.\" , , At least four Democrats and a dozen Republicans have joined the race for president. Democrats, Lincoln Chafee, former Rhode Island governor.

{"Content": "[\"We have a bunch of great talkers running for president,\" Jindal said at the Pontchartrain Center here in this New Orleans suburb, as supporters waved \"Geaux Bobby\" signs. \"Weve had enough of talkers. It is time for a doer.\" , The 44-year-old son of immigrants was the first Indian American to become a U.S. governor and, now, to become a serious presidential candidate. He sought to play up his long-shot status as a strength, casting himself as a man with nothing to lose, who owed nothing to the Republican establishment. \"I will do the things you cannot do in Washington,\" he said. \"I will say the things you cannot say.\" , , And in a novel move, he also released a hidden-camera video earlier in the day purportedly showing how he and his wife had announced the news to their children. \"We have decided we are going to be running for president this year,\" Jindal said, in the tone of a father saying they were expecting another baby. \"Thats good? So is that a surprise?\" , \"Maybe youll get a chance, if you behave, to go back to Iowa,\" Jindal told his children. He also promised them a puppy if he became president. At this point, it looks very unlikely that Jindals children will get a puppy. Thats because Jindal is the 13th Republican to enter the race, with several more to come. And at the moment, he is at the back of that large pack. In a recent Fox News poll, Jindal got just 1 percent of the vote - putting him behind all the other candidates in the poll. He was also behind \"None of the Above,\" which got 2 percent. In campaign videos, and in an introductory speech by his wife, Jindal was cast as unafraid to take on long-shot fights. \"The key to Bobby Jindal is that he is absolutely fearless,\" Supriya Jindal said, adding that shed turned Jindal down in high school the first time he asked her out. When Jindal took the stage (to Garth Brooks \"Callin Baton Rouge\") he said he would try to slash the size of the federal government, show strength to American enemies overseas, secure the U.S. border, and try to reform Medicare and Social Security. Jindal also said - in a portion familiar from his pre-annnouncement stump speeches - that he would make sure new immigrants assimilated to U.S. culture to try to prevent enclaves of immigrants that reject American ways. Jindal also singled out former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush by name as insufficiently conservative. He concluded his speech by saying that - for Republicans to have a chance at winning the presidency - they might need to take a chance on a purist long shot. \"Republicans must stop being afraid to lose,\" he said. \"If we try to hide who we are again, we will lose again.\" , Just eight years ago, Jindals political future looked far brighter than it does now. A native of Baton Rouge, he was born Piyush Jindal but renamed himself \"Bobby\" after the youngest son on the Brady Bunch sitcom. He became a Rhodes scholar, a McKinsey consultant, and - still in his early 20s - the head of the massive Louisiana health department. Jindal ran for governor and lost, then ran for Congress and won. He was elected governor on his second try, in 2007. Back then, Jindal seemed to offer an attractive new vision of what a conservative could be: an Ivy League-educated son of immigrants, who had a relentless focus on making government run faster, smarter, and cleaner. During his first years, Jindal impressed people in Louisiana as a data-driven, hard-driving governor. It was politics that he had trouble with. To address doubts among national conservatives, Jindal repeatedly embraced harder-line conservative positions - both in terms of Louisianas budget and in terms of social issues. But each time, he moved further away from the wonky, pragmatic persona that had made him famous in the first place. So the doubts grew. And Jindal tried to be more hard line. , At least four Democrats and 13 Republicans have joined the race for president. Democrats, Lincoln Chafee, former Rhode Island governor.

{"Content": "[WASHINGTON - President Obama won new powers from Congress on Wednesday to bring home an expansive Pacific Rim free-trade deal that analysts said could boost U.S. economic standing in Asia and ultimately burnish his foreign-policy legacy. Obamas victory on Capitol Hill, 12 days after House Democrats nearly scuttled his bid for fast-track authority, sets the stage for his administration to complete the multination Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, by years end. It represents a hard-won payoff for a president who was willing to partner with his Republican rivals and defy a majority of his party in pursuit of an accord that aides have said will ensure that the United States maintains an economic edge over a rising China. The intensive legislative fight - waged for months by a White House eager to score a rare, bipartisan legislative victory late in Obamas tenure - appeared to be coming to a close after the Senate voted 60-38 to grant final approval to the fast-track bill. Also Wednesday, key House Democrats signaled they would concede defeat and support related legislation - which they had blocked two weeks ago to stall the trade agenda - that provides retraining aid for displaced workers. \"Within reach is an opportunity to shape tomorrows global economy so that it reflects both our values and our interests,\" U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said. Among area senators, Pat Toomey (R. Pa.), Tom Carper (D. Del.), and Chris Coons (D. Del.) voted yes. Bob Casey (D. Pa.), Cory Booker (D. N.J.), and Robert Menendez (D. N.J.) voted no. Among presidential candidates, Lindsey Graham (R. S.C.) voted yes; Bernie Sanders (I. Vt.), Ted Cruz (R. Texas), and Rand Paul (R. Ky.) voted no; and Marco Rubio (R. Fla.) did not vote, though a day earlier he voted to move the legislation forward. The trade promotion bill now heads to Obamas desk for his signature. It gives the executive branch additional powers for six years and authorizes the president, and his successor, to present trade deals to Congress for a vote on a specified timeline without lawmakers being able to amend the terms. Although the outcome is a full-fledged victory for Obama, the acrimony along the way has raised questions about the Democratic Partys cohesion heading into the 2016 election cycle. Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton, who supported the TPP as Obamas secretary of state, sought to distance herself from the pact more recently. Most Democrats have dismissed the strategic foreign-policy benefits of the trade deal, warning instead that the TPP will cost U.S. workers jobs in traditional manufacturing industries and exacerbate the nations widening income gap. \"The foreign-policy establishment of the executive branch has divorced itself from the domestic policy,\" said Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D. Ohio), who opposed the legislation. The 12 participating TPP nations - Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States, and Vietnam - account for 40 percent of the worlds economy. U.S. officials expect the new authority to jump-start the final rounds of talks. Negotiators still must work out deals on a number of thorny issues, including new rules on access to Japanese auto and agriculture markets. In addition to lowering tariffs, the trade pact also aims to expand copyright and intellectual-property protections and regulate the flow of information on the Internet. Once negotiations are complete, the administration will have to get a final deal through another vote in Congress, where labor unions are certain to renew their opposition efforts. The whole process could take six months or more and plunge the Democratic Party into further political turmoil in the middle of a presidential campaign. China, which is challenging the U.S. economy as the worlds largest in some measures, is not involved in the TPP negotiations. Obama administration officials have said the trade deal is being structured to allow additional countries to join after the initial deal is ratified. However, the officials said, China has a long way to go before it can meet the labor and environmental standards that will be included in the accord. Beijing has viewed the TPP skeptically and pursued its own efforts to expand its trade and financial ties in the region, including the new China-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which has won support from U.S. allies including Britain and Germany. Thats why Obamas push on trade is so vital, foreign-policy analysts said. A failure on TPP would lend weight to Chinese claims that the United States does not have staying power in Asia.]", "Date": "20150625", "Title": "[Obama scores a major trade win]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20150625_Obama_scores_a_major_trade_win.html\n", "Author": "[David Nakamura, Washington Post]"}
{"Content": "[Webb adds a decidedly more conservative option for Democratic voters in a field in which former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has tacked to the left under criticism from liberal former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley and socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (Ind. Vt.). Yet Webb is hard to pin down politically. A former Republican who served as secretary of the Navy for Ronald Reagan, Webb talks often of his military service in Vietnam. He is known for an idiosyncratic collection of positions that include opposition to the war in Iraq and advocacy for sentencing reform. An economic populist, he has accused Clinton of coming late to the conversation about excessive CEO pay, and he has regularly championed the plight of rural and working-class Americans. One of his central challenges will be to parlay those credentials into support among an increasingly liberal Democratic primary electorate. , As an often prickly iconoclast who chafes at the demands of the campaign trail - and who has openly doubted whether he could raise the necessary money to run for president - Webb also must demonstrate that he can build a viable presidential campaign operation. In an announcement message that ran over 2,000 words on his campaign website (which crashed for more than an hour after its release Thursday), Webb presented his differences with the rest of the field as his signature strength. \"I understand the odds, particularly in todays political climate where fair debate is so often drowned out by huge sums of money,\" he said. \"Lets clean out the manure-filled stables of a political system that has become characterized by greed.\" , In the announcement, Webb mixed his policy goals with his personal narrative - and dwelled far more than his rivals on national security. Reminding voters that he has \"spent my entire life in and around the American military,\" the Marine veteran reiterated his early and passionate opposition to the war in Iraq, his subsequent opposition to intervention in Libya, and his concern about negotiations with Iran. He promised not to allow Chinese territorial expansion and cyber attacks. \"We need a President who understands leadership, who has a proven record of actual accomplishments, who can bring about bipartisan solutions, who can bring people from both sides to the table to get things done,\" Webb said in an e-mail to supporters. As his Democratic rivals have, Webb called for investment in infrastructure and early childhood education as well as reform in the areas of immigration, student debt and criminal justice. He was an early advocate of overhauling the American prison system; this week he said that drug addiction should be treated as a medical rather than criminal concern. He called for a return to \"true economic fairness\" through changes in tax and labor policy. Many of his positions place him squarely to the right of his Democratic rivals. He has accused fellow Democrats of using low-income white men as a \"whipping post\" and argued against broad affirmative action and diversity programs. Just this month, he defended those who retain fondness for the Confederate flag. He opposes any increase in income taxes, while supporting capital-gains tax increases. He was critical of the Affordable Care Act, though he voted for it. He advocates for gun rights and against coal plant regulations. While several presidential contenders have professed indecision about their plans merely as a way to keep raising unlimited funds, for months Webb appeared genuinely undecided. He has made stops in early primary states, but not nearly as consistently as his top rivals. And already, he has experienced campaign turmoil, with two top staffers leaving his campaign in Iowa, the only state where he has an operation. Also, his political action committee has come under scrutiny for paying out $90,000 to his wife and daughter for website design and management. A spokesman defended the payments as legitimate. \"Jim feels pretty strongly about trying to do it differently, and unfortunately the process is bigger than any one individual,\" said a friend who preferred not to speak publicly of Webbs political chances. Webb is the fifth Democratic candidate to join the presidential race. , At least five Democrats and 14 Republicans have joined the race for president.

{"Content": "[\"I am here to ask you for your prayers, for your support, for your efforts, because I have decided to run for president of the United States,\" the two-term governor told a cheering crowd at a rally at Ohio State University. Kasichs speech was short on policy proposals, with almost no discussion of foreign affairs. Instead, it was long on biography and inspirational rhetoric, characteristics that Kasich hopes will peg him as a candidate with a style, message, and priorities that distinguish him from his rivals. To those who consider him a long-shot candidate, Kasich recounted other times when he has been underestimated, as a candidate and an elected official. \"They said it couldnt be done, but we proved them wrong,\" he said repeatedly, as if to encourage his supporters to have confidence that he can do so again in the presidential race. , , That, at least, is the way it looked on paper as the competition began. So far, however, none of the candidates has truly broken out or broken through, save for businessman Donald Trump, who has dominated the contest since his entry last month. Who will emerge as finalists in the GOP competition remains a matter of debate and conjecture. At this point, two races are underway. One is a contest among some of the most conservative candidates for supremacy in Iowa. The other is a largely separate contest among those candidates considered less conservative who will need a strong finish in New Hampshire to stay alive. It is the New Hampshire contest that is most attractive to Kasich, who will spend several days there this week campaigning. , Kasich, 63, served in the House for 18 years. He sat on the Armed Services Committee and was chairman of the Budget Committee, helping to lead a successful effort to balance the federal budget. He ran for president in 2000 but was an early casualty. He spent a decade in business and television before winning the governorship in 2010 in a state that often helps decide presidential elections. He won reelection in a landslide last November. In Ohio, he cut taxes and eliminated a sizable budget deficit. To the chagrin of conservatives, he engineered an expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. He called for spending more money on such things as treatment for drug and alcohol addiction. He cites his religious faith as motivating him to help those in need. He has said he is open to a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Now he is entering a Republican presidential field so large that not all of the candidates will be invited onto the stage at the first debate Aug. 6 in Cleveland. Fox News Channel, which is hosting that event, has said that only the top 10 candidates, based on a group of national polls, will qualify. Kasich is in danger of missing the cut for that home-state debate. Advisers hope that his late announcement will give him enough of a bounce to put him in the top 10. Short of that, he will look to become a credible contender in the Granite State. , Five Democrats and 16 Republicans have joined,  the race for president.

{"Content": "[Jeb Bush, among the rivals scrambling for notice in a campaign dominated at the moment by Donald Trump, played down the importance of Trumps performance, which drew a mix of cheers and jeers during the freewheeling 120 minutes Thursday night. \"I had fun last night,\" the former Florida governor said during a New Hampshire event that drew more than 300. \"I really enjoyed getting to know Donald Trump up close and personal.\", Bush bounded back on the campaign trail Friday in the format he prefers, an open-ended question-and-answer forum - not the 10-way debate, which he called \"not easy.\", , \"Party donors, party leaders need to take a deep breath, put down the sharp objects, step away from the window,\" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said at the RedState Gathering of conservative activists in Atlanta. \"The voters will decide who our nominee is. Theyll decide who the president is.\", And the voters seem to be loving the show. Thursday nights debate wasnt just the most-watched program in the history of Fox News Channel, it drew more than twice as many views as the previous record-setter - the 2012 election night. In fact, it stands as the most-watched television program of the summer so far, beating the last game of the NBA Finals and the womens World Cup soccer finals, the Nielsen company said. Undoubtedly, the reason for the record ratings was Trump. He was back on TV Friday, telling the morning talk shows he couldnt recall insulting women in the past - rejecting the premise of a debate question posed by Fox News Megyn Kelly. \"You know, some of the statements she made about the women, I dont recognize those words whatsoever,\" Trump said on ABCs Good Morning America. \"Were going to take a very serious look at it.\" , He wont have to look far. Trumps Twitter feed is sprinkled with insults to women - and some men - that use words such as dog, ugly, dumb, stupid, and disgusting. In the early hours of Friday morning, he also republished a tweet that referred to Kelly as a \"bimbo.\" , That dust-up, and Trumps refusal to say he would support the eventual GOP nominee if hes not the partys choice, earned him the top headlines from the debate, overshadowing some of the GOPs biggest stars and creating space for some new faces to shine. But for all the attention on Trump, Bush said Friday that the criticism lobbed at him by Democrats shows he is the candidate they fear most. \"Ill take that as a badge of honor,\" he said. While Bush was thinking about the general election, many of the contenders headed south for RedState to work on shoring up their support among the party base. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry noted that hed been relegated to the pre-debate debate for the seven candidates who failed to qualify for the main event. \"I was up late last night,\" Perry said. \"Not as late as I wanted to be.\" , But Perry campaigned as if one of the partys top-tier candidates, declaring that his 14 years as governor prove hes worthy of a promotion. \"Its important for our country to have this discussion about executive experience,\" Perry said, knocking President Obama as \"an inexperienced senator\" who has \"driven this country into a ditch.\" , New Jerseys Gov. Christie, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio also were speaking Friday at RedState. Bush will be there Saturday - along with Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. As Fiorina stood at the back of a packed hotel ballroom Friday to give a television interview, a gaggle of conservative activists watched, chattered, and snapped pictures as if she were a Hollywood celebrity. Minutes later, more than 1,000 people at RedState stood and roared as she took the stage and delivered an impassioned speech on the virtues of conservatism. \"Well, I dont know. I think we kind of rumbled last night. What do you think?\" Fiorina said. \"I had a lot of fun last night.\", A day after a strong performance in the pre-debate debate, Fiorina was reveling in rave reviews for her aggressive approach. In her first campaign stop since, the admitted longshot candidate - she has never held public office - embraced the prospect of new momentum for her underfunded campaign. She told the crowd at RedState that Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama all were once regarded as quixotic candidates. \"You know why all of those men served as president?\" she asked. \"Because people decided they wanted them to win.\", Former South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint, who now runs the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the ideological and personality struggle within the party as it searches for a nominee is a good thing. In part, he said, because he believes conservative activists are winning. \"Our work outside of Washington is paying off, because every one of those candidates wants to be the most conservative, \" he said. \"Our job is to start the parade, and we know the candidates will jump in front of that parade and lead it.\" , Christie told the RedState crowd Friday that his leadership of a Democratic-leaning state makes him \"battle tested for Washington.\" , During his Q&A, Christie fielded questions about how Southern conservatives can connect with his boisterous New Jersey personality. Christie said Americans from all regions care about a sound economy, national security, and individual liberty. Then, he added, \"Think about listening to this accent for eight years. . . . Youll just have to deal with the New Jersey thing. It will be fine.

{"Content": "[MANASSAS, Va. - Waving her rainbow-colored \"Get Bernie on the Ballot\" sign at a county fairground two hours south of the Mason-Dixon Line, Liz McCauley had no qualms in standing up in her pink tennis shoes for a presidential hopeful who calls himself \"a democratic socialist.\", After all, the 40-year-old lifelong Republican and former \"Marine brat\" says, shes stood down her dad and her brother - both Corps veterans - when they \"sputter Socialist! \" at the mere mention of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. \"The theocratic extremists have sort of pushed the moderates to the side,\" she said of her decision to ditch the GOP. But what really drew her to Sanders was pure bread-and-butter: the candidates call for free public college tuition and for expanded family leave that would help her care for her ailing husband. \"To let my daughter know that she might be able to afford the education that shes earned, without indebting myself for the rest of my life!\" McCauley said hopefully, as a crowd that swelled to about 2,000 for a nighttime rally kept streaming over the rolling hillside. As the 2016 presidential race shifts into second gear, converts like McCauley are whats behind something that pundits once called unthinkable: the rise of a wonky, rumpled and mildly dyspeptic 74-year-old senator into the early lead in the key Democratic battlegrounds of Iowa and New Hampshire. And as Sanders steadily gains on long-anointed front-runner Hillary Clinton in national polling, a few even wonder out loud if the question for 2016 is no longer just, \"Isnt it time for a woman in the White House?\" . . . but now, also, \"Is America ready for a socialist?\", Monday night in Manassas - the climax to a sometimes audacious Sanders weekend swing through the heart of the politically red South - showed both the promise and pitfalls as Sanders seeks to take his campaign, fueled by a tankful of indignation over income inequality, to a national audience. Some candidates adapt the message to the locale. Not this candidate. Exurban Virginias Prince William County - where Confederate Civil War victories still echo, even after it was captured by President Obama in the 2012 election, with help from a surging Latino vote - got the same message that big crowds in hipster havens like Portland, Ore. heard this summer. \"We are the 99 Percent, and we will take back power from the 1 Percent!\" thundered Sanders, his voice raw and hoarse after a long day on the trail, as darkness enveloped the outdoor rally. The cry was a seemingly conscious echo of the Occupy Wall Street movement that flared four years ago this week, with complaints against Americas wealth gap that now form Sanders platform. \"Its not a radical, left-wing idea to say if a person works 40 hours a week, that person should not live in poverty,\" Sanders added, to a boisterous cheer. He called for a $15 minimum wage and pushed his plan for free tuition at public colleges and universities, to be paid for in part by a tax on Wall Street speculation. The senators most enthusiastic supporters - packed in the bleachers behind him - at one point began a chant of \"Get Wall Street! Get Wall Street!\", \"Its like having a Greek chorus,\" said a bemused Sanders, chuckling at one of the few light moments of a nearly one-hour speech with the vibe of a passionate, serious college lecture - stripped of the political theater that dominates most American politics in the high-def era. From his supporters, three reasons for early enthusiasm for Sanders came up again and again: his concrete proposals that would help the middle class with tuition or medical bills; disgust with big-money politics and praise for the senators reliance on small donors; and the consistency of the story arc that started with campus activism in the 1960s. The crowd was an unusual blend - including a decent helping of baby boomers with a touch of gray and liberal political views forged in the wake of the 1963 civil-rights March on Washington, which Sanders attended. But perhaps the largest bloc was composed of twentysomethings and teens, born long after Sanders unlikely rise to become mayor of Burlington, Vt. in the 1980s. The first-time voters harped on what they saw as the pure authenticity of a candidate old enough to be their grandfather. \"I love his sincerity,\" said Hannah Andes, 18, her sunglasses framed by flowing hair dyed a bright pink, a Starbucks Frappuccino in one hand and a \"Sanders 2016\" bumper sticker in the other. Andes, who lives here and attends a nearby community college, said she began to support Sanders a couple of months ago after googling the views of the leading candidates. She liked where Sanders stood on gay rights, and now shes lobbying her college friends to join the cause. But the rally here also highlighted what at this point - still 4 1/2 months before the first caucus in Iowa - seems Sanders biggest hurdle: a struggle to make major inroads with black and Latino voters, who have outsize influence in Democratic primaries. Despite a large Hispanic community in Manassas, few if any were in evidence at Mondays rally, with a smattering of African-Americans in the crowd. Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia historian and political analyst, said by phone that Clintons name and familiarity, and a sense that she deserves a shot at the Oval Office, have made it difficult for rivals to gain traction with minorities. \"Bill Clinton was the first black president, and now were back to this,\" Sabato said of Hillary Clintons steady black support. He added that a possible candidacy by Vice President Joe Biden would further complicate things. But one black voter at the rally - Preston Miller, 31, from the Maryland suburbs, who works in cybersecurity for what he would only call \"an agency with three letters\" - seemed won over. Miller also used works like \"authentic\" and \"refreshing\" to describe Sanders, praised his refusal to attack the other candidates, and said that even if Sanders is a long-shot to become the 45th president, hes already made liberal ideas a bigger part of the 2016 election. \"Hes influencing the conversation,\" Miller said.

{"Content": "[Ending two years of speculation, Hillary Rodham Clinton announced her second campaign for president in a low-key Web video Sunday with a simple message: Its not about me. Its about you.\", Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion, Clinton said, striking the tone of populism at the heart of the 2016 campaign. The deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top. The former first lady, U.S. senator, and secretary of state begins as the overwhelming front-runner for the Democratic nomination. If she makes it back to the White House, Clinton would be the first woman elected president. Clinton was considered inevitable eight years ago, too, only to lose to then-U.S. Sen. Barack Obama, and she was quick to signal that she was taking nothing for granted. Im hitting the road to earn your vote  because its your time, she says in the video. The spot features vignettes of an African American couple expecting their first child, a gaycouple planning a wedding, two Spanish-speaking brothers getting ready to open a business, an older woman about to retire, a college student looking for her first job  even a young couple hoping to get their dog to stop eating the trash. Clinton does not appear until more than 90 seconds into the video, which is just over two minutes long. The video was posted to Facebook, the new Clinton campaign website, and released on Twitter moments after adviser John Podesta broke the news in an e-mail to supporters. Republicans have been attacking Clinton in general-election terms for months, criticizing her record as secretary of state and arguing that she would represent the third term of the Obama administration. Americans need a president they can trust, GOP chairman Reince Priebus said Sunday. Over decades as a Washington insider, Clinton has left a trail of secrecy, scandal, and failed policies.  The Clintons believe they can play by a different set of rules. Hillary Clinton has seen her poll numbers decline recently after revelations that she used a private e-mail server while secretary of state, deleting e-mails she said were not related to government business. She also has faced controversy over news that the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation has raised money from foreign governments, including Saudi Arabia. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a candidate for the GOP nomination, on Sunday blasted Clinton for taking money from Saudi Arabia, which restricts the rights of women and girls. I would expect Hillary Clinton, if she believes in womens rights, she should be calling for a boycott of Saudi Arabia, Paul said on NBCs Meet the Press. Instead, shes accepting tens of millions of dollars. Hillary Clinton resigned from the foundation board Sunday, CNN reported. A sizable chunk of liberal Democrats has been hoping for a more progressive candidate to challenge Clinton, with many trying to urge Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to take her on. Warren has declined. These intraparty critics say Clinton is too close to Wall Street and unlikely to take bold steps to reverse income and wealth inequality. A few Democrats, including former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, and Lincoln Chafee, the former Rhode Island senator and governor, have been considering challenges. Seventy-two percent of Democrats and independents in a Bloomberg Politics poll released Friday said it would be a good thing if Clinton faced serious competition for her partys nomination. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who ran Clintons 2000 campaign for the U.S. Senate, told Meet the Press he was holding off on an endorsement because he wants to see what her vision will be. Its time to see a clear, bold vision for progressive economic change, de Blasio said. Chafee, during an appearance Sunday on CNN- s State of the Union, blasted Clintons 2002 vote as a senator to authorize the Iraq war. If you show lack of judgment  then, what can we expect in the future? he said. Clinton will hold her first campaign events Tuesday and Wednesday in Iowa, and then will travel to New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada  the states with the earliest nomination contests. Advisers say that in a deliberate departure from 2008, Clinton will give fewer speeches to large crowds and instead will spend time with smaller groups of voters in more intimate settings like homes and coffee shops. She also will cut down on the size of her traveling party. Many voters said eight years ago they felt distant from Clinton, one of the most famous people in the world. Shes going to try to emphasize retail politicking, said Philadelphia lawyer Alan Kessler, a fund-raiser for Clinton in 2008 (and for the former president before that) and who is ready to line up donations for this campaign. If you ask some of us who know Hillary, she is spectacular when you get her in small groups and one-on-one meetings, Kessler said. While the Clinton team calibrates her branding and approach to campaigning, the tides of history are much harder to control. If she wins the Democratic nomination, she will have to persuade voters to give her party control of the White House for a third straight term  a hard sell in modern times. It has happened only once in the last 65 years, when Republican Vice President George H.W. Bush was elected to succeed Ronald Reagan in 1988.  tfitzgerald@phillynews.com ,  215-854-2718  @tomfitzgerald,  www.philly.com/bigtent, ,  ]", "Date": "20150412", "Title": "[Hillary Clinton to run for President]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/Hillary_Clinton_to_run_for_President.html\n", "Author": "[Thomas Fitzgerald, Inquirer Politics Writer ]"}

{"Content": "[MIAMI, April 13 (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida urged voters on Monday to make a \"generational choice\" for new leadership that is not mired in the policies of the past, as the Republican announced he will enter the 2016 race for the White House. Rubio, 43, presented himself as a fresh face who could find new approaches needed for the United States to solve its challenges and compete in a global economy, and criticized Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton as a leader stuck in \"yesterday.\", \"The time has come for our generation to lead the way to a new American century,\" Rubio told a cheering crowd at Miamis Freedom Tower, where thousands of Cuban exiles fleeing the Communist-run island in the 1960s were first registered by U.S. authorities. Rubio, a son of Cuban immigrants who rode the anti-establishment Tea Party wave of 2010 to national prominence, said voters could not choose leaders who were stuck in the ideas of the past. \"We must change the decisions we are making by changing the people who are making them,\" he said. \"This election is not just about what laws we will pass. It is a generational choice about what kind of country we will be.\", Without naming Clinton, who announced her candidacy on Sunday, Rubio made reference to \"a leader from yesterday\" who had \"announced her campaign yesterday.\", \"But yesterday is over, and we are never going back,\" he said. \"We Americans are proud of our history, but our country has always been about the future.\", Rubios relative youth contrasts with Clinton, who is 67 and has been on the national political scene for more than 20 years, initially as first lady and later as a U.S. senator and then secretary of state. Rubios call for new leadership also could be seen as an attempt to step out of the shadows of his political mentor, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, the son and brother of former presidents. Rubio likely will compete for donors and endorsements with Bush, who has been lining up support for a White House bid but has not yet formally entered the race. IMMIGRATION LIKELY STICKING POINT, Rubio will be the third Republican to formally announce a White House bid, following senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky. Rubios support registers in single digits in opinion polls of the likely contenders in a Republican presidential field. But aides believe Rubio, who was on 2012 nominee Mitt Romneys short list for vice president, will rise when voters take a closer look at him. Rubio will be competing for the limelight with Clinton, who  grabbed worldwide attention with the declaration of her candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Sunday. Clinton will hit the campaign trail in Iowa on Tuesday and Wednesday. Iowa holds the kickoff contest in the parties presidential nominating process early next year. While he owes his success to the Tea Party movement, Rubio also has drawn support from more traditional party elements as well as the libertarian-leaning network assembled by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch. His effort to overhaul the United States immigration system could be a sticking point for Republican conservatives, many of whom view any move to grant legal status to undocumented workers as \"amnesty.\", Rubio worked with Senate Democrats to pass a sweeping immigration reform bill in 2013 that would have bolstered border security and guest-worker programs with a pathway to citizenship for those already in the country illegally. The measure died in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. Rubio now says any immigration reforms must be passed piece by piece, with border security coming first, a position more in line with other Republican lawmakers. But he talks frequently about the central role immigrants play in revitalizing the United States. Rubio also called for a muscular foreign policy, portraying himself as the Republican most ready to handle threats to America. He highlighted his biography and the backgrounds of his father and mother and their journeys to the United States. \"I live in an exceptional country where even the son of a bartender and a maid can have the same dreams and the same future as those who come from power and privilege,\" he said.]", "Date": "20150413", "Title": "[Republican Rubio calls 2016 White House race a 'generational choice']", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/nation_world/20150413_Reuters_L2N0XA0XD_UPDATE_4_Republican_Rubio_calls_2016_White_House_race_a__generational_choice_.html\n", "Author": "[ Reuters]"}
{"Content": "[The Democratic front-runner will be in the state for two days of campaigning focused on her emerging 2016 economic platform. Clinton, who announced her long-expected campaign on April 12, remains the only declared Democratic candidate, although she is likely to have at least nominal opposition soon. Former Maryland governor Martin OMalley sounded very much like a candidate Sunday when he told CBS that he would make up his mind about running by the end of May. \"I think it would be an extreme poverty indeed if there werent more than one person willing to compete for the presidential nomination of the Democratic Party,\" OMalley said on Face the Nation. Former Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia also has said he is close to deciding whether to challenge Clinton. Clinton will visit a small, family-owned childrens furniture and toy manufacturer in Keene, N.H. on Monday and a community college in Concord on Tuesday. Like the roundtable-style discussions that she held last week in Iowa, the New Hampshire campaign stops are intended to look and feel low-key. Her campaign said she would talk \"about how to make the economy work for everyday Americans so their families can get ahead and stay ahead.\", She is not expected to begin laying out detailed policy proposals for several more weeks. In the meantime, her growing national campaign is heading to states with early presidential contests, and high expectations of personal service from candidates, while trying to avoid anything that makes it look too much like Clinton takes the nomination for granted. She is skipping big rallies and has not sat down for any media interviews. Longtime Clinton backer Terry Shumaker, a two-time cochairman of Bill Clintons New Hampshire presidential campaigns, said Hillary Clinton is taking the right approach for his state. \"Start small, build from the ground up, and meet as many new people as possible,\" Shumaker said, summing up the plan. Many potential Democratic voters have either moved to the state since she last campaigned there in 2007 and 2008 or were too young to vote in that election, he said. It will be important for Clinton to connect with those potential supporters, even in a state with a strong affection for the Clinton family, he said. \"Taking New Hampshire for granted is risky. Just ask Walter Mondale or George [H.W.] Bush . . . ,\" Shumaker said. \"Our shoals are littered with the shipwrecks of front-runners.\", By tradition, New Hampshire holds the nations first presidential primary. Clinton has been preparing for that February contest for months, hiring 19 staffers for the state even before her first visit. By contrast, a Boston Globe count showed that potential candidates attending the Republican Leadership Summit over the weekend had three or four paid staffers at the most. A primary victory in New Hampshire helped Clinton rebound from a devastating third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses in 2008. It wasnt enough to reboot her flawed campaign and stop the momentum of then-Sen. Barack Obama, but both Clintons thanked the state when they campaigned for Democrats there during last falls midterm elections. Clinton got mostly good notices from Democrats in Iowa last week, but New Hampshire is friendlier territory for her party. Republicans rehearsed their Clinton attacks across the state, focusing as much or more on the Democrat as on one another. Sen. Marco Rubio (R. Fla.) said Sunday that he sees little or no difference between Clinton and what he called the failed ideas of President Obama. He said he would be a better leader than either of them. \"I believe a Clinton presidency would basically be another four years of Barack Obama,\" Rubio said on Face the Nation. He added, \"We cannot ignore that she was secretary of state during the first four years of the Obama presidency and has virtually no meaningful achievements to show for it.\", ]", "Date": "20150420", "Title": "[Hillary Clinton heads to New Hampshire]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/nation_world/20150420_Hillary_Clinton_heads_to_New_Hampshire.html\n", "Author": "[Anne Gearan, Washington Post]"}
{"Content": "[With the downtown New York skyline and new World Trade Center over her shoulder, Clinton offered herself as a fierce advocate for those still struggling from the Great Recession. She promised to carry on the liberal legacies of President Obama, and former Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Bill Clinton, saying \"real and lasting prosperity must be built by all and shared by all.\", While Clinton ended her first campaign for president in 2008 by conceding she and her backers \"werent able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling,\" she vowed Saturday to push ahead toward an \"America where a father can tell his daughter: Yes, you can be anything you want to be - even president of the United States.\" , , Clinton, 67, former secretary of state, first lady, and Democratic senator from New York, did not make her gender a core element in 2008, but it provided the cap to the first major speech of her 2016 bid. \"I will be the youngest woman president in the history of the United States. And the first grandmother as well,\" she said. Two months after starting her campaign with a simple video that showed her only briefly, Clinton outlined a broad vision intended to attract the coalition of young and minority voters that propelled Obama to two victories. In her roughly 45-minute speech, Clinton laid out a wish list of Democratic policies: universal pre-K education, increased regulation of the financial industry, paid sick leave, equal pay for women, a path to citizenship for immigrants living in the country illegally, campaign finance overhaul, and a ban on discrimination against gay people and their families. In doing so, Clinton tried to cast the 2016 election as a choice about the economic future of the middle class, saying the Republican field is \"singing the same old song.\" The GOPs candidates, she said, want to give Wall Street banks free reign, take away health insurance, \"turn their backs\" on gay people, and ignore the science of climate change. Republicans jumped on Clintons decision to cite her ties to Obama and were trying to raise money off the speech almost as soon as it ended. In an e-mail appeal for donations, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry wrote, \"We want to look toward a brighter future, not backward at the failed policies of the Obama-Clinton years.\" , As part of an effort to reintroduce herself to the public, Clinton stressed her career of advocacy - a calling she said was inspired by her mothers difficult upbringing. After the rally, she headed to Iowa for a campaign event Saturday night. That will be followed next week by a tour of early voting states. There, she will focus on her relationship with her mother and her fathers background as a veteran and small businessman. Clinton is the dominant front-runner for the nomination in a race that also includes Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley, and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee. Clintons aides said she plans to give a policy address almost every week during the summer and fall. New York has one of the highest rates of income inequality in the country, so Clintons remarks here could foreshadow a campaign that will draw contrasts with rivals over who best can provide for the countrys economic security. \"Prosperity cant be just for CEOs and hedge-fund managers,\" Clinton said. \"You brought our country back, now its your time to secure the gains and move ahead.\", Yet the Clinton familys financial history makes some in her party skeptical of her populist credentials. Both Clintons have earned millions in speaking fees, including some from Wall Street banks, and daughter Chelsea and her husband have worked at hedge funds. Clinton remained silent on some issues of importance to the Democratic base, most notably a Pacific Rim trade pact backed by Obama but opposed by organized labor, liberals, and others who say it will cost the U.S. jobs. , Hillary Clinton calls for a new era of shared prosperity.

A caption in Arabic said Salopek was killed \"for his countrys participation in the war against the Islamic State,\" and came after a deadline had passed for Egypt to meet his captors demands to free jailed Islamist women. , The developments suggest the investigation into the security of Clintons email setup could run deep into 2016, as she is trying to win the Democratic nomination for president and, potentially, the general election. Clinton campaign aides argue theres nothing for investigators to find, and the State Department says its not yet clear if the material at issue ought to be considered classified at all.

That presented a quandary for U.S. officials organizing tomorrows ceremony to mark the reopening of the embassy on Havanas historic waterfront. Inviting dissidents would risk a boycott by Cuban officials including those who negotiated with the U.S. after President Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro declared detente on Dec. 17. Excluding dissidents would certainly provoke fierce criticism from opponents of Obamas new policy, including Cuban-American Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio.

{"Content": "[WASHINGTON - Neither of the two emails sent to Hillary Clinton now labeled by intelligence agencies as \"top secret\" contained information that would jump out to experts as particularly sensitive, according to several government officials. One included a discussion of a U.S. drone strike, part of a covert program that is widely known and discussed. A second conversation could have improperly referred to highly classified material, but it also could have reflected information collected independently, U.S. officials who have reviewed the correspondence told the Associated Press. Still, its looking increasingly likely the issue of whether Clinton mishandled classified information on her home-brew email server will have significant political implications in the 2016 presidential campaign. Clinton, who has been seen from the outset as the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, agreed this week to turn over to the FBI the private server she used as secretary of state. And Republicans in Congress have seized on the involvement of federal law enforcement in the matter as a sign she was negligent in handling the nations secrets. On Monday, the inspector general for the 17 spy agencies that make up what is known as the intelligence community told Congress that two of 40 emails, in a random sample of 30,000 messages that Clinton gave the State Department for review, contained information deemed \"top secret,\" one of the governments highest levels of classification. BRUSSELS - Finance ministers of the 19-nation euro single currency group yesterday approved the first 26 billion euros ($29 billion) of a vast new bailout package to help rebuild Greeces shattered economy. The approval came after Greeces parliament passed a slew of painful reforms and spending cuts after a marathon overnight session that divided the governing party, raising the specter of early elections. \"Of course there were differences but we have managed to solve the last issues,\" Eurogroup chairman Jeroen Djisselbloem told reporters in Brussels. \"All the intense work of the past week has paid off.\", Ten billion euros will be available to recapitalize Greece banks, while a second slice of 16 billion euros will be paid in installments, starting with 13 billion euros by Thursday when Greece must make a new debt payment to the European Central Bank. \"On this basis, Greece is and will irreversibly remain a member of the Euro area,\" said European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker after the deal was sealed. DELACROIX, La. - Rocky Morales is watching his small Louisiana town of Delacroix slowly melt into the water. The woods where he played hide-and-seek as a boy are gone. Its all water and mud back there now. So, too, is the nearby marsh where townsfolk once trapped for muskrat, otter and mink. Many of the fishermen who once lived here - his friends and relatives - have disappeared as well, fleeing behind the levees protecting New Orleans out of fear one more hurricane will send the rest of Delacroix into the sea. Ten years after Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast - killing more than 1,830 people and causing more than $150 billion in damage in the nations costliest disaster - New Orleans has been fortified by a new $14.5 billion flood protection system. But outside the iconic city, efforts have lagged to protect small towns and villages losing land every year to erosion. And as that land buffer disappears, New Orleans itself becomes more vulnerable. In the past century, more than 1,880 square miles of Louisiana land has turned into open water - an area nearly the size of Delaware. And the loss continues, with an average 17 square miles disappearing annually, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. WASHINGTON, - American hostage Kayla Mueller was repeatedly forced to have sex with Abu Bakr Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State group, U.S. intelligence officials told her family in June. \"They told us that he married her, and we all understand what that means,\" Carl Mueller, Kaylas father, told the Associated Press yesterday, which would have been his daughters 27th birthday. Her death was reported in February. Her mother, Marsha Mueller, added, \"Kayla did not marry this man. He took her to his room and he abused her and she came back crying.\", The news is but the latest in a litany of horrors perpetrated by the Islamic State group, which has beheaded, burned and crucified male captives while passing around women as sex slaves. Mueller was held for a time by Islamic State financier Abu Sayyaf and his wife, known as Umm Sayyaf. Al-Baghdadi took Mueller as a \"wife,\" repeatedly raping her when he visited, according to a Yazidi teenager who was held with Mueller and escaped in October 2014. SANDUSKY, Ohio - A safety inspection found no major problems with a roller coaster that struck and killed a man who entered a restricted area to look for a lost cellphone at Ohios Cedar Point amusement park, a spokesman said yesterday. Police say 45-year-old James A. Young had just finished riding the Raptor on Thursday and jumped over a fence to retrieve something he dropped during the 57 mph ride. The Erie County coroner says it was his cellphone. Sandusky police said Young was struck by the ride or someone on it. No one else was hurt. The ride was examined overnight by state safety officials and found to be in safe working order, so it resumed operating yesterday, park spokesman Bryan Edwards said. He wouldnt comment on whether officials are considering any changes to the Raptor or the area around it. - Associated Press]", "Date": "20150816", "Title": "[Officials: Clinton emails not very 'top secret']", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/nation_world/20150816_Officials__Clinton_emails_not_very__top_secret_.html\n", "Author": "[ ]"}

{"Content": "[After a string of sunny seasons gripped by controversy, crises and plummeting popularity, the summer of 2015 has been among the most productive stretches of Obamas presidency. Late June victories in the Supreme Court on health care and gay marriage, along with a win for his trade agenda on Capitol Hill, were followed by the landmark Iran nuclear deal in July and the raising of the U.S. flag over a new embassy in Cuba in August. Instead of being overshadowed by the 2016 presidential campaign, Obamas agenda has often been driving the debate among the candidates running to replace him. And yet to the president, one of his summers biggest successes may simply be making it through his annual vacation on the stony Massachusetts island of Marthas Vineyard largely uninterrupted. While his summer troubles have often trailed him on previous vacations, he closed out this years trip yesterday without any statements to the press or public appearances, beyond a few glimpses of him on the golf course and biking with his family. Indeed, the president returned to Washington with a full schedule and confrontations with Congress that will help determine whether his summer momentum is sustained or sputters. Atop the presidents priorities is preventing Congress from blocking the Iran deal, which curbs Tehrans nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars in sanctions relief. Obama will likely have to veto a resolution of disapproval by lawmakers, blemishing his signature foreign policy initiative, but he appears on track to garner enough from support from Democrats to hold off Republican override efforts. Obama is also hoping to avoid the second government shutdown of his presidency. Some conservative Republicans have threatened to hold up funding bills to keep the government open after Oct. 1 unless federal money for Planned Parenthood is cut. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. has dismissed the prospect of a shutdown, saying: \"Weve been down this path before.\" Still, the issue has spilled into the 2016 presidential campaign, which will likely intensify the debate over linking government funding to the womens health organization. Seeking to bolster his legacy abroad, Obama will also be pushing for a global climate treaty and finalization of a free trade agreement with Asia-Pacific nations. His string of summer successes began with Congress agreeing to a fast-track approval process for the trade pact when negotiations are complete. September also holds a White House meeting with Pope Francis, a state visit for Chinese President Xi Jinping, where Beijings high-profile hacking will be on the agenda, and the presidents annual trip to New York for the United Nations General Assembly. For Obama, now deep in his second term, a busy, high-stakes agenda sure beats the alternative. His presidency appeared to be quickly slipping into lame-duck territory last year, but began to rebound after Democrats defeats in the midterm election and picked up momentum this summer.\\r\\t\\t]", "Date": "20150824", "Title": "[Summer vacation over for Obama]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/nation_world/20150824_Summer_vacation_over_for_Obama.html\n", "Author": "[ Associated Press]"}
{"Content": "[WASHINGTON - The possibility that Vice President Biden may jump into the 2016 presidential campaign is convulsing the network of wealthy Democrats that financed President Obamas two White House bids, galvanizing fund-raisers underwhelmed by Hillary Rodham Clintons performance. A wide swath of party financiers is convinced Biden will make a late entry into the race and a sizable number are contemplating backing him, including some who have signed on with Clinton, according to more than a dozen top party fund-raisers. Their potential support - driven in part by a desire to recapture the passion they felt in Obamas campaigns - could play a key role in helping Biden decide whether to move forward on a third White House run. He addressed the issue Wednesday in a private conference call with members of the Democratic National Committee, saying he was assessing whether he had \"the emotional fuel\" to run. \"Were dealing at home with . . . whether or not there is the emotional fuel at this time to run,\" he told DNC members, according to CNN, which obtained access to the conversation. \"If I were to announce to run, I have to be able to commit to all of you that I would be able to give it my whole heart and my whole soul, and right now, both are pretty well banged up\" - a reference to the death of his son Beau in May. Clinton still maintains a deep and loyal donor base, and her financial dominance would present a huge challenge for Biden. She amassed a record $47 million during her first quarter as a candidate and is flanked by an array of super PACs and other independent allies socking away millions to help her secure the presidency. But there is growing unease among some of Obamas biggest financial backers about the controversy over Clintons use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. While Biden has not built his own fund-raising network, he has developed personal relationships with donors around the country. Many are still up for grabs. Of the 770 fund-raisers who bundled checks for Obamas 2012 reelection, just 52 have signed on so far as a \"Hillblazer\" bundler for Clinton or have hosted a fund-raiser for her, according to a Washington Post analysis. Top Democratic money players - many of whom requested anonymity - said discussions among senior Obama fund-raisers about Bidens possible bid have taken a serious turn in the last few days. Kirk Dornbush, a San Francisco biotech executive who helped lead Obamas fund-raising in the South and has not signed on with Clinton, said Biden would find a receptive audience among the presidents bundlers. \"Obama donors - the whole Obama world - just loves Joe Biden. Just loves Joe Biden,\" said Dornbush, whose father served as President Bill Clintons ambassador to the Netherlands. Jon Cooper, a former Obama bundler who is the national finance chair for the Draft Biden 2016 super PAC, said he was fielding increasing interest from fund-raisers he worked with in the last two presidential campaigns. Nearly a dozen of the 35 bundlers Cooper contacted personally have committed to help if the vice president runs, according to the Long Island technology manufacturer. Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin declined to comment on donor interest in a Biden campaign, saying, \"Hillary Clinton is grateful to the hundreds of thousands of people who have stepped up to support her campaign and made her first quarter in the race a historic one.\", ]", "Date": "20150827", "Title": "[Donors hearing a buzz for Biden]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/nation_world/20150827_Donors_hearing_a_buzz_for_Biden.html\n", "Author": "[Matea Gold, Washington Post]"}
{"Content": "[As they headed into the 2016 election, Republicans thought they had a strategy for moving past their immigration woes. Outlined in a so-called \"autopsy\" of 2012 nominee Mitt Romneys loss to President Obama, it called for passing \"comprehensive immigration reform\" - shorthand for resolving the status of the estimated 11 million people living in the country illegally. Those plans ran aground in the GOP-controlled House, falling victim to the passionate opposition among conservatives to anything they deem \"amnesty\" for such immigrants. Some Republicans then hoped candidates with more moderate positions on immigration - such as Jeb Bush, the Spanish-speaking former Florida governor, or Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native and son of Cuban parents - would rise during the 2016 campaign and boost the partys appeal to Hispanic voters. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton was in Cleveland yesterday and drew parallels between terrorist organizations and the field of Republican candidates for president when it comes to their views on women. She told the Ohio audience that her potential GOP rivals were pushing \"out-of-date\" policies. \"Now extreme views about women? We expect that from some of the terrorist groups. We expect that from people who dont want to live in the modern world,\" Clinton said. \"But its a little hard to take coming from Republicans who want to be the president of the United States, yet they espouse out-of-date and out-of-touch policies,\" she added at a rally with 2,800 people in Clevelands Case Western Reserve University. \"They are dead wrong for 21st century America.\", In her remarks, she did not mention any specific terrorist or militant groups, such as the Islamic State, which has held women as sex slaves in Iraq and Syria. Republicans swiftly accused the Democratic presidential front-runner of directly comparing the Republican presidential field to terrorists. \"For Hillary Clinton to equate her political opponents to terrorists is a new low for her flailing campaign,\" said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Allison Moore. \"She should apologize immediately for her inflammatory rhetoric.\"\\r\\t\\t]", "Date": "20150828", "Title": "[GOP alienating one another with immigration?]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/nation_world/20150828_GOP_alienating_one_another_with_immigration_.html\n", "Author": "[ Associated Press]"}
{"Content": "[Joey Meek, 21, faces federal charges that, if convicted, could land him in prison for years. But with Roof already in jail facing federal hate crime charges and nine state counts of capital murder, why would there be a case against Meek?, Legal experts say prosecutors likely want him to testify against Roof - testimony that could help show Roofs alleged acts were premeditated and intentional, which are vital to pursuing a death penalty case. During a hearing in Columbia yesterday, Meek stood before a federal magistrate in handcuffs, shackles and an orange jumpsuit. He answered \"yes\" to questions about whether he understood the charges of lying to investigators and concealing information and the possible sentences they carry. He pleaded not guilty and his bond was set at $100,000. Maj. Gen. Kenneth Dahl told a packed courtroom at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio that Bergdahl felt the problems were so severe that they put his platoon in danger, but that Bergdahls perceptions were \"completely off the mark.\", Dahl said Bergdahl had an elaborate plan to head from his post to the forward operating base roughly 19 miles away, expecting to arrive while a search was underway and to create a \"PR event\" that might get a general to listen to him. Bergdahl was captured by the Taliban after leaving his post on June 30, 2009, and held until last year, when he was exchanged for five Taliban commanders being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. His commanding officers in Afghanistan testified Thursday about the grueling 45-day search for Bergdahl, saying it put other soldiers in danger. The nearly party-line 241-187 vote followed a no-holds-barred debate that included a graphic, poster-sized photo of a scarred, aborted fetus and underscored how abortion has resurfaced as a white-hot political issue. The battle has been rejoined just in time for the 2016 election campaign and next weeks historic address to Congress by Pope Francis. The issues re-emergence followed the release of secretly recorded videos of Planned Parenthood officials offhandedly discussing how they sometimes procure tissue from aborted fetuses for medical research. The anti-abortion activists who made the videos say they show that Planned Parenthood is illegally profiting from fetal organ sales. Democrats said the true GOP goal was to whip up conservative voters with legislation that would make it harder for women to get health care. Some survivors say they never even received notice of the most destructive California wildfires in recent memory, raising questions about whether more could have been done to notify residents. Authorities defended their warnings and rescue attempts, saying they did all they could to reach people in the remote area of homes, many prized for their privacy. In a separate filing, attorneys for the gay couples who sued Davis appear to agree. Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis spent five days in jail for refusing to obey a federal judges ruling that she issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples to comply with a U.S. Supreme Court decision that effectively legalized gay marriage nationwide. U.S. District Judge David Bunning released Davis from jail on the condition that she not interfere with her employees as they issue marriage licenses. When she returned to work, Davis altered the marriage forms by removing her name, making deputy clerk Brian Mason initial the form instead of sign it, and then requiring the form to be notarized. - Associated Press, ]", "Date": "20150920", "Title": "[Charge: Pal stayed mum about church carnage]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/nation_world/20150920_Charge__Pal_stayed_mum_about_church_carnage.html\n", "Author": "[ ]"}

{"Content": "[SANTA CLARA, Ca. (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton lamented the pay gap between men and women to a crowd of female technology executives on Tuesday, in a speech that showed she may make gender inequality a main theme in her likely 2016 presidential bid. It was the first of three speeches the former U.S. secretary of state plans to give to predominantly female audiences in the coming weeks, ahead of her presumed but officially undeclared second attempt to run for president. She is the favorite to win the Democratic nomination by a large margin. With repeated references to breaking \"glass ceilings\", Clinton noted that less than a quarter of software developers are women, and partly blamed technology companies for fostering a loutish culture. \"Its been almost a Wild West environment,\" she said of Silicon Valleys boom in recent decades. \"I think a lot of women find that distasteful, to be in a situation sort of resembling a locker-room.\", She was warmly received by thousands of women and a smattering of men at a convention center in the heart of Silicon Valley, where women commandeered many of the mens bathrooms during the course of the day. Teams from Oracle Corp, Ericsson and Intel Corp were among those in attendance. They laughed knowingly as Clinton made her practiced non-committal noises about whether she will run. Although she did not drift from previous positions, it seemed clear she hoped to emphasize her interest in gender inequality. In her unsuccessful run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008, Clintons campaign tended to downplay her gender and the historic nature of the prospect of a woman being elected president for the first time. She now appears to have fewer qualms, and has recently relished describing herself as a grandmother. Next month, Clinton is due to speak at the annual conference of Emilys List, the political action committee that helps to elect women who support abortion rights. Later in March, she addresses the Toner Prize award ceremony, named for the late Robin Toner, the first woman to become a New York Times national political correspondent. Taking questions after her speech, she criticized the National Security Agency, which a whistleblower revealed was secretly gathering data on millions of Americans, as not transparent enough. \"People felt betrayed,\" she said. \"You didnt tell us you were doing this and now were reading this on the front page.\", , (Additional reporting by Sarah McBride in San Francisco; Editing by Ken Wills)]", "Date": "20150225", "Title": "[Hillary Clinton highlights gender pay gap ahead of likely presidential bid]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150225_Reuters_Report_KBN0LT05O_Hillary_Clinton_highlights_gender_pay_gap_ahead_of_likely_presidential_bid.html\n", "Author": "[Robin Respaut, Reuters]"}

{"Content": "[NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. Feb 28 (Reuters) - Senator Rand Paul won a straw poll of conservative activists on Saturday, giving his potential bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 a boost, and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker came in second in a surprising show of strength. Whether the victory for Paul will have long-lasting benefit is unclear since his libertarian views may not have broad appeal in the Republican Party. Paul, a 52-year-old Kentucky Republican, outdistanced most other potential candidates by taking 25.7 percent of the vote at the Conservative Political Action Conference, a gathering of activists on Washingtons outskirts of Washington. \"The constitutional conservatives of our party have spoken in a loud and clear voice today,\" Paul said in a statement. \" I plan on doing my part and I hope you will join me as I continue to make the GOP a bigger, better and bolder party.\", Walkers second-place showing at 21.4 percent represented a significant show of support among conservatives and suggested his potential candidacy will have real staying power as he seeks to remain among the front-runners for the nomination. Texas Senator Ted Cruz came in third with 11.5 percent of a total of 3,007 who registered votes at the CPAC gathering. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, an establishment candidate who is amassing millions of dollars for a campaign should he decide to run, took fifth place with 8.3 percent of the vote, a not-unexpected showing given conservative opposition to some of his moderate stances. Boos rang out in the audience when Bushs tally was announced. The Bush camp made clear that he did not compete in the straw poll, which is a survey of people attending the conference. The straw poll concluded the four-day conference at a hotel along the Potomac River, where conservatives heard from more than a dozen potential contenders for the chance to represent the Republican Party in the November 2016 election. Walker, 47, was clearly among the most popular at the event. But Paul had a strong showing from activists, and his victory in the straw poll marked the third year in a row in which he came out on top, dominating the event just as his father, former Texas Congressman Ron Paul, had. The CPAC straw poll, however, does not necessarily identify the next Republican presidential nominee. Mitt Romney won the straw poll in 2012 and went on to win the nomination. But the 2008 nominee, John McCain did not win the poll. The poll also asked respondents about other issues, with 41 percent saying they would like to legalize marijuana.

{"Content": "[WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama took aim at his Republican opponents and his gaffe-prone vice president on Saturday in a satirical speech that included a roast of his former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over her recent problems with email. Obama joined Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, a potential Republican contender for the 2016 presidential election, and Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe of Virginia for the annual Gridiron dinner, an evening of song and skits making light of major players in U.S. politics. Obama joked that his reputation for being a tech-savvy president had now been eclipsed by his one-time foe Clinton, who has come under fire for using a private email account for her work as the nations top diplomat. \"If you think about how things have changed since 2008, back then I was the young tech-savvy candidate of the future. Now Im yesterdays news and Hillarys got a server in her house!\", \"I am so far behind,\" he said to laughter. Walker also had some fun with Clintons email controversy, tying her to wealthy Wall Street donors. \"I even have Hillarys private email,\" Walker said. \"It goes right to her campaign headquarters. You know, its hillaryclinton@wallstreet.com,\" he said. Walker quipped that the joke was written by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is known for crusading against Wall Street, and who some Democrats hope will challenge Clinton. Obama, feeling loose with less than two years left in office, noted criticism that he had taken a \"selfie\" photo in a viral video promoting his health insurance program, but he turned the tables on Republican senators who sent a letter to Iran warning them against a nuclear deal Obama hopes to secure. \"You dont diminish your office by taking a selfie. You do it by sending a poorly written letter to Iran,\" Obama said. Obama also ribbed Vice President Joe Biden for his touchy-feely habits. Biden drew criticism for massaging the shoulders of the wife of incoming Defense Secretary Ash Carter at his swearing-in ceremony. \"Joe rubs my shoulders, too,\" Obama said. Obama jabbed Walker for dodging a question during a recent trip to London on whether he believed in evolution. \"I absolutely believe in the theory of evolution - when it comes to gay marriage,\" Obama said to laughter. Obama came out in favor of gay marriage in 2012 after many years of what he described as a personal evolution in his thinking about the subject.

He would become the first Republican presidential candidate to announce a run for the 2016 election. Cruz, a leading conservative who was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2012, is slated to make a speech on Monday at Liberty University in Virginia. \"Youre going to want to be there,\" a member of Cruz staff told the Daily Beast web site but declined to reveal the specific nature of the address. Last weekend the first-term Texas senator was in New Hampshire, a state crucial to presidential aspirants because of its early primary. Also there were other potential candidates: Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida; former Texas governor Rick Perry; and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. Cruz has also spent time in Iowa, another key early state. In an interview on MSNBC last week, Cruz said he had been getting \"very encouraging\" support regarding a presidential run. Liberty University, an evangelical Christian school, was established by the late conservative evangelist Jerry Falwell. Cruz would aim to raise between $40 million and $50 million over the course of the primary campaign, the Chronicle reported.]", "Date": "20150322", "Title": "[Texas Senator Ted Cruz to announce presidential run - report]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150322_Reuters_Report_KBN0MI04G_Texas_Senator_Ted_Cruz_to_announce_presidential_run__report.html\n", "Author": "[ Reuters]"}

David Koch said at a fundraiser for the New York State Republican Party on Monday that he and his brother would support the partys eventual nominee in the general election, but that it should be Walker, the paper reported, citing two people in attendance. The Koch brothers are among the best-known conservative donors, and potential Republican candidates court their favor. The pair has said they plan to spend nearly $900 million during the 2016 campaign cycle. Walker already has allied himself with the more conservative wing of his party, making statements such as saying he would not support a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Those moves were intended to set Walker apart from others in the Republican field, particularly former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who has an advantage in national name recognition and fundraising over many other possible 2016 contenders. It was not clear how much the Kochs planned to help Walker with his primary run, the Times said.

Western nations have poured aid into Somalia to helpreconstruction and prevent it from sliding back into the handsof al Shabaab. An African Union force, AMISOM, supported by U.S. dronestrikes, has pushed the al-Qaeda-affiliated militant group fromits former strongholds, but it uses territory inside the countrystill under its control to launch attacks there and in Kenya andother neighboring states. \"In recognition of the progress made and the promise tocome, the United States will begin the process of establishingthe premises for a diplomatic mission in (the Somali capital)Mogadishu,\" Kerry said in a statement. During a three-hour visit inside the perimeter of the citysairport, surrounded by seven-foot walls of sandbags, Kerry metSomali President Hassan Sheik Mohamud, the prime minister andprovincial leaders. \"While we do not yet have a fixed timeline for reopening theembassy, we are immediately beginning the process of upgradingour diplomatic representation,\" Kerry said. MORE PROGRESS NEEDED, In February, Washington named Katherine Dhanani as its ambassador to Somalia, the first since the early 1990s whenfighting between warlords plunged the nation into chaos. The United States pulled its forces out of Somalia after the1993 \"Black Hawk Down\" incident when a U.S. helicopter was shotdown over Mogadishu, killing 18 soldiers - at that time thedeadliest day for the U.S. military since the Vietnam war. Other Western nations, including Britain, have alreadyopened embassies. For now, Dhanani will make regular trips toSomalia from a base in Nairobi, a U.S. official said. Kerry said Somalia had made progress but acknowledged morewas needed. In a bid to shore up the government and expand its control,Somalia is due to hold a referendum on a new constitution and apresidential election in 2016. Diplomats say political bickeringand government reshuffles have hindered that process. Somalias president was previously picked by lawmakers whowere themselves nominated, not voted for, by their communities. A senior State Department official, who briefed reportersahead of the visit, said Somalia was expected to hold \"some formof election\" in 2016. \"It has to be something that shows that they are movingforward in terms of a representative government,\" the officialsaid. Somali officials were only told on Monday of Kerrys visitdue to security concerns, initially being told a lower rankingofficial was visiting. \"This is a great moment for us,\" President Mohamud said ashe greeted Kerry at the airport, remarking that the capital hadchanged over the past two years. \"The roads are less bumpy and we have traffic jams,\" hesaid, to which Kerry replied: \"Well, youre getting normal.\" (Writing by Lesley Wroughton in Nairobi; Editing by LouiseIreland and John Stonestreet)]", "Date": "20150505", "Title": "[UPDATE 3-U.S.' Kerry talks diplomatic ties on surprise visit to Somalia]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150505_Reuters_L5N0XW29W_UPDATE_3_U_S___Kerry_talks_diplomatic_ties_on_surprise_visit_to_Somalia.html\n", "Author": "[ Reuters]"}

May 27 (Reuters) - Republican Rick Santorum, who fell short in his 2012 presidential bid, launched another run for the White House on Wednesday with a promise to restore the economic power of middle-class American workers. Santorum, 57, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, emphasized his working-class roots as he formally opened his long-shot 2016 presidential bid near his childhood home in Cabot, in western Pennsylvania. Looking to build support beyond the social and religious conservatives who bolstered his 2012 campaign, Santorum said \"big government\" and \"big business\" had left behind American workers. \"Today is the day we are going to begin to fight back,\" he said. \"As middle Americas hollowing out we cant sit idly by. Working families dont need another president tied to big government or big money.\", Santorum promised to eliminate the Internal Revenue Service, back a flat tax and crack down on illegal immigration that he says has robbed jobs from American workers. He also vowed to cut federal spending and revoke \"every executive order and regulation that costs Americans jobs.\", In the 2012 race, Santorum won Iowas kickoff contest and 10 other state contests with strong support from voters drawn to his social and religious conservatism and wary of the more business-oriented Mitt Romney. Santorum outlasted other White House hopefuls to become the last remaining challenger to Romney, who ultimately captured the 2012 Republican nomination. Santorum, whose support has languished in the low single digits in most polls ahead of the 2016 race, faces a stronger and potentially tougher field of Republican hopefuls this time. He is the seventh Republican to formally declare a bid for the nomination, more than a year ahead of the November 2016 presidential election, joining a group that includes U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. Other Republicans expected to jump into the race include former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. Santorum will face competition for Christian conservative voters, who helped propel his 2012 bid, from former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, Cruz and others, while his low poll ratings raise the possibility that he could be excluded from the early Republican debates, which begin in August. \"I know what its like to be an underdog,\" Santorum said, adding he managed to win 11 state nominating contests because \"I stand for someone, the American worker.\", \"The last race, we changed the debate. This race, with your help and Gods grace, we can change the nation,\" he said. A Catholic, Santorum won a reputation as a strong social conservative in Congress, where he opposed same-sex marriage and the teaching of evolution in schools. He infuriated the gay community by comparing homosexuality to bestiality.

Trump wallowed in political incorrectness as he insultedeveryone from Mexican immigrants to Jeb Bush and U.S. ally  Saudi Arabia in announcing his bid for the Republicannomination. \"I will be the greatest jobs president that God evercreated,\" Trump predicted in a long, combative speech in theatrium of Trump Tower on Manhattans Fifth Avenue. The billionaire, widely seen as having almost no chance ofwinning the nomination, brings an outsized personality and apenchant for controversy to an unusually large group ofRepublicans vying for the presidency. In highly provocative comments, Trump accused Mexico ofsending rapists and other criminals to live in the UnitedStates. \"Theyre sending people that have lots of problems andtheyre bringing their problems,\" he said. \"Theyre bringingdrugs, theyre bringing crime, theyre rapists, and some Iassume are good people, but I speak to border guards and theytell us what we are getting.\", Eleven other Republicans have announced they are running fornext Novembers election, the latest being former FloridaGovernor Jeb Bush who officially launched his bid on Monday. Trump hit out at Bush for backing the Common Core educationinitiative to set national education standards, which is mistrusted by many Republicans. \"Bush is totally in favor of Common Core. I dont see how hecan possibly get the nomination. Hes weak on immigration, hesin favor of Common Core. How the hell can you vote for this guy?You just cant do it.\", Trump, who owns several hotels and hosts the reality show\"The Celebrity Apprentice\" on NBC, boasted having $8.7 billionin net worth, a number he says he released so that Americaunderstands he is not a loser. Trump has flirted with the notion of running in pastelections, but has ultimately backed out each time. This time,he said, the United States needs him to come to the rescue andrevive a \"dead\" American dream. \"Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the dayand we as a country are getting weaker,\" he said. LIVELY DEBATE WITH TRUMP, Republican strategists and officials cringe at the thoughtof Trump grabbing attention away from the partys more seriouscandidates as it tries to win back the White House after defeatsin 2008 and 2012. \"Donald Trump is a great entertainer and developer, but hisideas of what to do as president wont grow the economy,\" saidDavid McIntosh, president of the influential Club for Growth, aconservative group which advocates for small government. Trumps first big challenge is to make it into a Fox Newsdebate of Republicans in August that will be open to only thetop 10 candidates in national polling. As it stands, Trump languishes in 12th place, ahead only offormer New York Governor George Pataki, in a Reuters/Ipsosonline poll of 13 Republicans who have either declared theircandidacies or, like Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, are likelyto. Bush leads the poll. In other surveys, Trump has high negative ratings, with morethan 50 percent of Americans saying they will never considervoting for him. On Tuesday, he saved his wildest attacks for foreign policy,frequently accusing China of stealing American jobs throughcrafty business practices and portraying himself as a tough negotiator who would beat Beijing at its own game. \"Hey, Im not saying theyre stupid. I like China. I justsold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China,\" hesaid. \"No, I love them, but their leaders are much smarter thanour leaders,\" he said. \"Its like, take the New England Patriotsand Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team.Thats the difference between Chinas leaders and our leaders.They are ripping us.\", He urged Saudi Arabia to be more appreciative of themilitary and diplomatic support it has received from the UnitedStates for decades. \"Saudi Arabia without us is gone,\" hewarned.

{"Content": "[WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will call for tax credits for businesses that hire and train apprentices as a way to raise wages and boost youth employment during a campaign stop in South Carolina on Wednesday. Clinton is expected to unveil her proposal, which calls for a $1,500 tax credit per apprentice, during an afternoon forum at Trident Technical College, a two-year community college in the Charleston area, according to campaign aides. Clintons proposal mirrors a bipartisan bill introduced in the U.S. Senate last year that would grant businesses a $1,500 tax credit for hiring an apprentice under the age of 25 and $1,000 for those 25 and older, her campaign said. The backers of the Senate bill, which has not yet passed, said it would create about 400,000 positions and help meet a demand for skilled U.S. labor. Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination ahead of the November 2016 election, entered the second phase of her campaign this week after declaring her candidacy in mid-April. In her first large rally in New York City on Saturday, Clinton said businesses should be encouraged to create good jobs instead of increasing profits at workers expense, and she will expand on that theme in South Carolina on Wednesday, her campaign said. Clinton has struck a populist tone during the first months of her campaign, often remarking how the \"deck is stacked\" against U.S. workers and how Wall Street bankers pay lower tax rates than nurses or truck drivers. Clintons first campaign stops in Iowa and New Hampshire, which hold the first party nominating contests, included round tables at community colleges. Clintons campaign, in a background policy document provided to reporters, described her apprenticeship proposal as a \"win-win\" for businesses that need skilled employees and workers in need of well-paying jobs. The campaign pointed to a 2012 study cited by the Department of Labor that found apprenticeships are associated with a worker earning an average of $6,595 more annually. The unemployment rate for 18- to 34-year-olds outpaces the overall unemployment rate at 7.8 percent to 5.5 percent, the campaign said. In rolling out the tax-credit proposal, Clinton is expected to emphasize the role her mother played in instilling the value of hard work. Her campaign also highlighted a Clinton Foundation program that created economic opportunities for young people in the United States.

{"Content": "[By Luciana Lopez and Hilary Russ, NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who suffered in the polls after a politically motivated bridge traffic tie-up, will announce on Tuesday he is running for president, according to a source familiar with his plans. Christie will join more than a dozen other Republicans who have declared their intentions to seek the partys nomination for the November 2016 presidential election. Christie, known for his brashness, has spent time in the past few months in the early voting states of New Hampshire and Iowa laying out policy proposals, including on the economy and national security. Public radio station WNYC first reported Christies planned announcement. The 52-year-old Christie has been a controversial figure in New Jersey politics, seen as honest and plain spoken by supporters and a bully by detractors. The controversy surrounding the 2013 George Washington Bridge lane closure fueled views that Christie relied on strong-arm politics to get his way. In May a former Christie ally pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the scandal, while two others were indicted. New Jerseys highest court ruled last month that Christie can cut $1.6 billion from state pension funding, removing a hurdle for his national ambitions and giving some temporary financial relief to the state. He has won praise for his ability to connect with voters in person, seen in town halls across New Jersey and New Hampshire. Nevertheless, Christie has struggled to gain traction. A recent poll by Fairleigh Dickinson Universitys PublicMind found his approval rating in New Jersey at just 30 percent. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal on Wednesday became the 13th Republican to announce his bid for the presidency. Other Republicans who have already announced include former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker is expected to formalize his candidacy in coming weeks. In a rolling five-day Reuters/Ipsos poll, results through June 2 show Christie with 5.6 percent support among the Republican hopefuls, behind Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, Walker, Rubio and surgeon Ben Carson.

{"Content": "[BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Monday downplayed an accusation by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton that Beijing had tried to \"hack into everything that doesnt move in America\". At a campaign event in New Hampshire on Saturday, Clinton said the U.S. must be \"fully vigilant\" about Chinas military, adding that Beijing had stolen commercial secrets from defense contractors and \"huge amounts of government information\". Beijing has in the past expressed outrage over U.S. government claims it engages in state-sponsored hacking of commercial information, saying China is itself a victim of hacking attacks. Asked about Clintons remarks, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the two sides had taken a \"constructive spirit\" in tackling the issue. \"China and the U.S. have taken a constructive spirit and approach to strengthening dialogue and cooperation to jointly face various challenges in line with the interests of both sides in a way that is conducive to peace and prosperity in the region and the world,\" Hua told a regular news briefing.

{"Content": "[PHOENIX - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, whose caustic comments about Mexicans have inflamed the immigration debate, told thousands of cheering supporters here Saturday that \"we have to take back the heart of our country.\", In a rambling, defiant speech delivered in this border state that has been the epicenter of the nations divisive battle over immigration reform, Trump declared: \"These are people that shouldnt be in our country. They flow in like water.\" One man in the crowd of 4,200 shouted back, \"Build a wall!\", Basking in polls that show he has risen to the top of the crowded Republican field, Trump took obvious glee in mocking former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, the establishment favorite who is setting fund-raising records. \"Jeb Bush, lets say hes president - Oy, yoy, yoy,\" Trump said. He asked the crowd: \"How can I be tied with this guy? Hes terrible. Terrible. Hes weak on immigration.\", Trumps 70-minute address here, which sounded more like a stream-of-consciousness rant than a presidential-style stump speech, put an exclamation point on his bombastic push since his presidential announcement last month to return immigration to the forefront of the national conversation. Bush and illegal immigrants were not the only targets of Trumps scorn: He also criticized Macys, NBC, NASCAR, U.S. ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, and, several times, the media. Republican leaders say they believe the celebrity billionaire has virtually no chance of being their nominee, much less of making it to the White House. And, for now at least, his following seems limited to the far right as opposed to the partys mainstream. Yet Trump has reignited a heated debate over an issue, immigration, that the GOP had been determined to settle after it hurt Republicans in the most recent presidential election. Party leaders increasingly fear that Trump could do damage to more viable candidates, such as Bush, who could lose their own footing on immigration. These candidates confront a familiar challenge: During the primary season, they must deal with the anger and anxiety that many on the right feel about illegal immigration. But they must do it in a way that will not damage their appeal to a broader electorate in November 2016. Republicans are handling Trump delicately for another reason as well: They fear that he could leave the GOP entirely and wage a well-funded third-party campaign, a possibility that Trump has not ruled out. The crowd in Phoenix began lining up outside the convention center before dawn, with many spending hours in temperatures that exceeded 100 degrees. Hundreds of people, who stood in lines snaking down several downtown blocks, did not make it into the ballroom for his speech. Many of Trumps supporters blame illegal immigrants for crime and economic problems but also express dismay over cultural changes. \"We dont recognize our country anymore,\" said Jan Drake, 72, who lives in a retirement community outside Phoenix. \"If youre coming into our country, you have got to conform to what we stand for. You speak English. You dont try to change our country to what your country was.\", After watching Trump on television the past couple of weeks, Drake said that she has become convinced that \"he would be a very strong president. He doesnt kowtow to anybod.\", After he walked onto a catwalk stage here like a rock star, Trump basked in his crowd. \"The word is getting out that we have to stop illegal immigration,\" he said. While Trump was railing against Spanish-language broadcaster Univision, a handful of protesters in the crowd interrupted. Trumps security guards arrived to break up the skirmish that followed. His supporters screamed \"USA! USA! USA!\" in the protesters faces as the guards escorted them out of the convention hall. \"I wonder if the Mexican government sent them over here,\" Trump said from the stage. He assured the crowd, \"Dont worry, well take our country back.\", Trump also had harsh words for Islamic State terrorists. If he becomes president, Trump said, \"They will be in such trouble . . . ISIS, believe me, I would take them out so fast. You have to do it.\", But it was his crusade against illegal immigrants that had Trumps crowd most enthused. \"The silent majority is back, and were going to take the country back.\" He walked off the stage to Twisted Sisters \"Were Not Gonna Take It.\", ]", "Date": "20150712", "Title": "[Trump: Time to 'take back' the country]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150712_Bluster_bump_in_polls_often_does_not_last.html\n", "Author": "[Philip Rucker  and Robert Costa, Washington Post]"}

{"Content": "[He has encouraged voters to reject school budgets in communities where teachers werent accepting pay freezes, pushed to change civil-service rules, and signed legislation that forced employees to pay more toward to their pensions and health benefits. Now that Christie has joined the 2016 Republican presidential primary field, his administration is taking another tough stance toward public workers. It recently told thousands of union members whose contracts expired June 30 that they will not be receiving annual incremental pay increases while there is no new deal in place. Christies freeze affects state office workers, college professors, corrections officers, and other groups of public workers who have not yet reached the top of their pay scales. Public-worker unions have been responding to the Christie administrations new position on pay increments - something many view as a pressure tactic - by filing administrative grievances. And at least one union, Policemens Benevolent Association Local 105, has filed suit in Superior Court. Lance Lopez, president of PBA Local 105, said the administrations freeze affects 3,700 members of his union. The prior agreement with the state said that the rules established under a contract that expired on June 30 would be extended for a year if no new agreement was reached, he said. And the union would have had to have been informed in writing by Feb. 1 of any change, which did not occur, he added. \"In the past theyve always maintained these step increments,\" Lopez said. \"We believe that its a violation of the agreement that we had.\", The administrations position on step pay comes as the amount public employees contribute to their health-care coverage is becoming a hot issue. Thats because a four-year sunset provision on health-care contributions was a part of the 2011 law that forced them to pay more toward both pensions and health benefits. Because of the sunset provision, health-care contributions will be back up for negotiation as contracts come up for renewal. By taking the stance that workers are no longer entitled to step increases, the administration appears to be adopting a position the state Public Employment Relations Commission took last year in a case in Atlantic County, in which the local government was in a labor dispute with sheriffs officers. \"We have acted appropriately and fully within the law,\" said Christie spokesman Brian Murray. The pay-increment issue has heated up just as the four-year sunset provision in the June 2011 worker-benefits law commonly referred to as Chapter 78 has started to become a factor in contract negotiations at all levels in the state. Chapter 78 is the same law that called for the state to increase its own contributions to the chronically underfunded public-employee pension system over a seven-year term. But Christie, despite touting the reform effort as having saved the pension system, reneged on the promise to make increased pension contributions last year amid state budget problems. The state Supreme Court said last month that the state constitution does not compel Christie to follow the payment schedule that was promised under Chapter 78 as a contractual right of the employees. That ruling came even as the employees are still paying more toward their pensions because there was no sunset provision in place like the one that applies to health benefits. Depending on how contract negotiations go, state and local governments could be forced to once again pick up more of the cost of their employees health benefits. Murray said Chapter 78 only started the process of controlling health-coverage costs, which are a huge expense for the state. But Lopez, the corrections union official, countered that it is wrong for the administration to say it wants to abide by certain components of Chapter 78 while at the same time choosing to ignore other requirements spelled out in the law, such as the state pension contributions. \"You shouldnt be able to pick and choose portions of Chapter 78 that you feel are right,\" he said. \"Its not fair.\", , ]", "Date": "20150715", "Title": "[Christie toughens stance with public workers]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150715_Christie_toughens_stance_with_public_workers.html\n", "Author": "[John Reitmeyer, NJ SPOTLIGHT]"}

{"Content": "[WASHINGTON (AP) - A new letter by intelligence investigators to the Justice Department says secret government information may have been compromised in Hillary Rodham Clintons private server, underscoring an inescapable reality for her presidential campaign: Email is forever. Clinton, the former secretary of state and now the leading Democratic presidential candidate, wants to focus on the economic issues she and her team believe will drive the next election. But they remain unable to fully escape the swirling questions surrounding her decision to run her State Department correspondence through an unsecured system set up at her New York home. The inspector general of the U.S. intelligence community recently alerted the Justice Department to the potential compromise of classified information arising from Clintons server. The IG also sent a memo to members of Congress that he had identified \"potentially hundreds of classified emails\" among the 30,000 that Clinton had provided to the State Department - a concern the office said it raised with FBI counterintelligence officials. Though the referral to the Justice Department does not seek a criminal probe and does not specifically target Clinton, the latest steps by government investigators will further fuel the partisan furor surrounding the 55,000 pages of emails already under review by the State Department. A statement from the intelligence inspector general, I. Charles McCullough, and his counterpart at the State Department, Steve Linick, said that McCulloughs office found four emails containing classified information in a limited sample of 40 emails. \"This classified information should have never been transmitted via an unclassified personal system,\" they said. For Clinton, the news amounted to a major distraction on a day when shed hoped to focus on unveiling a new set of economic policies. Instead, she opened her New York City speech by addressing the controversy, decrying some reports as inaccurate. Some media initially reported that Justice Department had been asked to consider a criminal investigation into whether she mishandled her emails. \"We are all accountable to the American people to get the facts right, and I will do my part but Im also going to stay focused on the issues,\" she said. It was not immediately clear whether the Justice Department would investigate the potential compromise highlighted by the intelligence inspector general. The office has not suggested any wrongdoing by Clinton, according to U.S. officials speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the referral publicly. But the inspector generals office said in its letter to Congressional oversight committees that it was concerned that \"these emails exist on at least one private server and thumb drive with classified information and those are not in the governments possession,\" said Andrea Williams, a spokeswoman for McCullough. None of the emails were marked as classified at the time they were sent or received, but some should have been handled as such and sent on a secure computer network, said the letter sent to congressional oversight committees. Clinton has maintained that she never sent classified information on her personal email account, which she said in March she used as a matter of convenience to limit her number of electronic devices. The State Department has made public some of the emails involving Clinton, and is under court order to make regular further releases of such correspondence. The aim is for the department to unveil all of 55,000 pages of the emails she turned over by Jan. 29, 2016. But a federal judge this month chastised the department for moving too slowly in providing The Associated Press with thousands of emails submitted through the Freedom of Information Act. Republicans are pushing Clinton to turn over her server to a third party for a forensic evaluation. \"Her poor judgment has undermined our national security, and it is time for her to finally do the right thing,\" said House Speaker John Boehner. Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said she had followed \"appropriate practices in dealing with classified materials.\", But theres little dispute among intelligence officials that Clinton should have been more careful with her information - though her behavior was likely not criminal. Current and former U.S. intelligence officials say they assume that all of the email that transited Clintons home server is in the possession of Russian or Chinese intelligence services, who would have easily bypassed whatever security measures she took. They, too, spoke on condition of anonymity because they werent authorized to discuss the Clinton email situation publicly. Whether a security violation or not, the risk for Democrats is that questions about her email harden into an early narrative about Clintons honesty and management skills. Already, Republicans have spent months depicting Clinton as a creature of Washington who flouts the rules for personal gain. Clintons people say questions about her correspondence wont sway voters, who they argue are more focused on economic and family issues. But, there are signs that the issue may have already affected views of their candidate. An Associated Press-GfK poll released last week found that voters view her as less decisive and inspiring than when she launched her presidential campaign just three months ago. Just 3 in 10 said the word \"honest\" describes her very or somewhat well. ___, Associated Press writers Jack Gillum and Matthew Lee in Washington and Ken Dilanian in Aspen, Colorado, contributed to this report. ___, Follow Lisa Lerer and Eric Tucker on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/llerer and http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP]", "Date": "20150724", "Title": "[New inquiry into Clinton emails fuels political questions]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150724_ap_2835a480970b46089db7fc4ac96e1da5.html\n", "Author": "[LISA LERER and ERIC TUCKER, The Associated Press]"}

{"Content": "[AMES, Iowa - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton on Sunday unveiled a plan aimed at combating climate change that includes proposed revisions in the tax code to promote renewable energy and goals for renewable sources for consumer electricity. In Iowa, the nations second-leading wind energy producer, Clinton said people are \"just not paying attention\" if they dont acknowledge climate change. \"This is not complicated folks,\" the former secretary of state told more than 200 people at Iowa State University. \"Im just a grandmother with two eyes and a brain. And I know were facing huge problem.\", Climate change has become a key issue in the Democratic presidential primary, where Clinton is the heavy favorite. Billionaire Tom Steyer, based in California, has led an effort to promote the issue. He hosted a fund-raiser for Clinton in May. Clinton proposes, through tax incentives, to increase the amount of power derived from renewable sources to support every home in the United States within 10 years. For instance, Clinton said she supports renewing the wind energy tax credit as part of over time shifting the U.S. energy system from one based on fossil fuels. \"We need to get the incentives fixed in our tax system which as you know are too heavily weighted toward fossil fuels,\" Clinton said during a day of campaigning in central Iowa. Clinton also hinted that her plans would impose changes on the coal industry, though she also pledged the governments help for workers to make the transition. \"We can make a transition over time from a fossil fuel economy, predominantly, to a clean renewable energy economy, predominantly,\" Clinton said later in a central Iowa rural home. Weaning the country off of coal is a tricky political position in key places on the political battleground map. Southeast Ohio and Western Pennsylvania are regions of states that have been pivotal in recent elections. And they remain the home of key coal-producing areas. Crediting coal-miners for having \"created an industrial revolution,\" Clinton said \"it is important that we help them transition to a new economy.\", She was scheduled to discuss the plan in detail during an event in Des Moines on Monday. Former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley, also seeking the 2016 Democratic nomination, noted Sunday that he unveiled a climate change plan in Iowa that addresses not just consumer energy use, but industrial and transportation, as well. As governor, OMalley doubled Marylands renewable fuel production, and reduced greenhouse gases in the state by 10 percent during his two terms. ]", "Date": "20150727", "Title": "[Clinton outlines plan to tackle climate change]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150727_Clinton_outlines_plan_to_tackle_climate_change.html\n", "Author": "[Thomas Beaumont, Associated Press]"}
{"Content": "[WASHINGTON (AP) - Nearly all of the contenders for president are encouraging their deep-pocketed donors to give not just to their campaigns, but to groups known as super PACs as well. Unlike campaigns, these outside groups arent limited in how much money they can accept from individual donors. While they cant directly take orders from the candidates theyre spending money to help elect, they still account for about $2 of every $3 raised so far in the 2016 race for president. Many super PACs must file their first fundraising reports with federal regulators by midnight Friday. The super PAC filings will detail how money was raised and spent from January to the end of June and include the names of donors. Two weeks ago, many of the candidates filed their first campaign fundraising reports. Together, the reports from the super PACs and the candidates will produce the first major accounting of who is paying for the campaign for president. Here is a guide to whats already known about the presidential super PACs, based on information provided by the groups and their official filings with the Federal Election Commission. ___, THE BIGGEST DONORS, A super PAC aiming to help Texas Sen. Ted Cruz win the Republican presidential nomination raised from a single donor nearly as much as the candidates formal campaign raised in three months. A $10 million donation from Toby Neugebauer is the largest contribution so far to any of the candidate-specific super PACs. Neugebauer is an energy investor in Texas and the son of GOP Rep. Randy Neugebauer. The money went to Keep the Promise II, one of several similarly named super PACs all working to help elect Cruz. The Wilks family in Texas pooled together for a $15 million gift to a second pro-Cruz super PAC. Brothers Farris and Dan Wilks made billionaire lists by getting into the booming shale gas industry. ___, LOCAL MILLIONS FOR WALKER, RUBIO, TD Ameritrades billionaire founder Joe Ricketts, his wife, Marlene, and their son Todd together gave just over $5 million to a super PAC supporting Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walkers Republican presidential ambitions. The Ricketts family owns the Chicago Cubs. Diane Hendricks, the billionaire executive of a wholesale roofing company headquartered in Wisconsin, also wrote a $5 million check. Those donors accounted for half of the money raised by the pro-Walker super PAC, called Unintimidated. Richard Uihlein and his wife, Elizabeth, gave $2.5 million. In recent years, Uihlein moved his packaging supply company, Uline, entirely out of Illinois and into Wisconsin because of tax incentives. Million-dollar donors also featured prominently in the super PAC supporting Florida Sen. Marco Rubios presidential bid. Miami-based automobile dealer Norman Braman gave $5 million; Besilu Stables LLC, owned by Miami health care executive Benjamin Leon, gave $2.5 million. In total, the group Conservative Solutions pulled in about $16 million, including a $3 million gift from Oracle founder Larry Ellison. A lone local donor also is propping up the super PAC supporting former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Of the $3.6 million raised by Pursuing Americas Greatness, 83 percent came from Ronald Cameron, chief executive of Arkansas-based Mountaire Corp. one of the countrys largest poultry companies. ___, JEB BUSHS JUGGERNAUT, Right to Rise, a super PAC helping Republican former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, is backed by two dozen donors who have given $1 million or more. Miguel \"Mike\" Fernandez, a Miami health care investor, made the biggest contribution at just over $3 million. Four Texas couples who built fortunes from the oil and gas industry are also among the biggest donors, with each couple contributing $2 million: Trevor and Jan Rees-Jones, Ray and Nancy Hunt, Richard and Nancy Kinder, and Hushang and Shahla Ansary. Both of Bushs ex-president relatives also donated to Right to Rise. His father, George H.W. Bush, gave $125,000; brother George W. Bush gave $95,000. Jeb Bush aggressively courted big donors in the six months before he announced his presidential campaign, when he faced no legal restrictions on his work with the super PAC. Now that hes a candidate, Right to Rise is in the hands of a longtime friend and strategist, Mike Murphy. ___, CORPORATE DONORS, Another highlight of the Right to Rise donor list is corporate money. Four dozen corporations or organizations gave a total of more than $16 million to the super PAC, or about 15 percent of its overall haul. The largest corporate contribution was $2 million from Rooney Holdings, a Tulsa, Oklahoma-based construction company. San Francisco-based American Pacific International Capital Inc. an investor and developer with projects in the United States and China, gave $1.3 million. Another roughly $1 million gift came from Juno Beach, Florida-based Nextera Energy Inc. a large energy company that operates in 27 states and Canada. The company owns Florida Power and Light, the largest electric company in the state, where Bush was governor. The charitable trust for the U.S. Sugar Corporation, a sugar-cane producer based in Florida, gave $505,000. Meanwhile, Manhattan-based Access Industries, an international holding company led by Len Blavatnik, one of the worlds wealthiest men, gave $1 million to a pro-Walker super PAC and $500,000 to one supporting the longshot presidential ambitions of South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham. The Supreme Courts 2010 decision in the case Citizens United made it clear that corporations and unions can contribute in unlimited ways to political races, so long as that money comes through outside groups that are not directly coordinated with the candidates. Corporations and unions remain legally barred from giving to the official campaigns of the candidates. ___, CHRIS CHRISTIE SUPPORTERS, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie may not be leading in the Republican presidential polls, but his supporters are contributing six and seven figures to a super PAC supporting his candidacy. The filing from the America Leads super PAC provides one of the first insights into Christies fundraising network, which includes notable names such as New York Mets owner Fred Wilpon, Hewlett-Packard Chief Meg Whitman and Linda McMahon, the former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment. The group raised $11 million through the end of June. Among the largest contributions were $1 million each from hedge fund manager Steven Cohen and his wife Alexandra Marie Cohen, and $750,000 from Quicken Loans founder Daniel Gilbert. Christies brother Todd gave $100,000, while long time Christie cheerleader and Home Depot co-founder Ken Langone gave $250,000. The list, according to a person familiar with the numbers, includes more than a dozen billionaires as well as many donors the group believes could afford to spend much more should the governors campaign take off in the coming months. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss donors financial information. ___, RAND PAULS (PAY)PALS, PayPal board member and Silicon Valley investor Scott Banister gave $1.25 million to Concerned American Voters, one of three super PACs supporting Kentucky Sen. Rand Pauls presidential bid. All three filed their FEC reports earlier this week. Two other donors gave big to pro-Paul entities. Jeff Yass, managing director of high-frequency trading firm Susquehanna International Group, split a $2 million contribution between Purple PAC and Americas Liberty. George Macricostas, head of a data center company called RagingWire, gave more than $1 million to Americas Liberty. Thanks mostly to those three donors, the trio of pro-Paul super PACs raised about $6 million through the end of June. ___, RICK PERRYS TEXAS TWOSOME, Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry isnt performing well enough in national polls to guarantee hell have a spot on the first GOP debate stage, and his campaign has so far only raised about $1 million. But thanks to two Texans, his presidential effort has the money to carry on. Several super PACs working together as an operation called Opportunity and Freedom say they raised $16.8 million through June 30. About two-thirds came from Kelcy Warren and Darwin Deason. Warren, a billionaire Dallas energy executive who gave $6 million, also serves as finance chairman of Perrys campaign. Because of that position, hes legally restricted in what he can tell the super PAC. Fellow Dallas businessman Deason gave $5 million. Deason made his fortune by selling Affiliated Computer Services, a data-processing company, to Xerox. ___, DEMOCRATIC DOLDRUMS, There wont be much talk of Democrats in the presidential super PAC filings. Thats because they account for less than 9 percent of the total super PAC haul so far, according to an Associated Press analysis that compared money raised by formal presidential campaigns with what the super PACs say they plan to report having raised on Friday. Priorities USA Action, the main group helping Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton, will report having raised $15.6 million by June 30. Haim Saban, an entertainment executive, gave $2 million to Priorities, making him the top donor. Hedge fund billionaire George Soros, one of the biggest Democratic donors in earlier elections, gave $1 million. ___, Associated Press writers Jack Gillum, Stephen Braun and Jill Colvin contributed to this report. ___, Follow Julie Bykowicz on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/bykowicz]", "Date": "20150731", "Title": "[News Guide: Super PAC backing Cruz gets $10 million donation]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150731_ap_285b8288b62f464da58404f718b346b4.html\n", "Author": "[JULIE BYKOWICZ, The Associated Press]"}

{"Content": "[WASHINGTON - Hillary Rodham Clinton and her husband paid close to $44 million in federal taxes since 2007 and she is in \"excellent physical condition\" - two facts that emerged Friday in a flood of disclosures about the Democratic presidential candidate pushed out by her campaign on a busy summer day. Within a three-hour period, the State Department made public more than 2,200 pages of e-mails sent from Clintons personal account, her campaign released a letter from her personal doctor about her health and she unveiled eight years of tax returns. Meanwhile, Clinton herself was campaigning at the annual meeting of the National Urban League and calling for an end of the nations trade embargo of Cuba during a speech in Miami. Friday was also the deadline for super PACs to file their first financial reports of the 2016 campaign with federal regulators, revealing the names of a slew of billionaires and millionaires paying for the early days of the 2016 election. Campaign aides cast the records dump as part of an effort to compete with Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush on the issue of transparency. Clinton is the first 2016 presidential candidate to release her health records, and aides said she released more detail about her finances than Bush, the former Florida governor who has already made public 33 years of his tax returns. Republicans didnt buy it. \"This massive Friday news dump was not a good-faith effort at transparency, it was a deliberate attempt to sweep things like three dozen more classified e-mails under the rug,\" said Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short. The Clintons earned more than $139 million between 2007 and 2014, according to the returns, and made almost $15 million in charitable contributions - including a $3 million donation to their family foundation in 2014. Last year, they paid an overall federal tax rate of 35.7 percent. The couple made nearly $23 million from speaking fees alone in 2013 - the year Clinton left the State Department - and collected an additional $20 million from paid events last year. The remainder of their income came largely from book royalties and consulting fees paid to former President Bill Clinton. In a statement, Clinton emphasized that she came into her wealth later in her life - an effort to draw a distinction with Bush, the scion of a rich political family. \"Weve come a long way from my days going door-to-door for the Childrens Defense Fund and earning $16,450 as a young law professor in Arkansas - and we owe it to the opportunities America provides,\" she said. Bush has earned nearly $28 million since leaving the Florida governors mansion in 2007 and paid an effective federal income tax rate of roughly 36 percent in the last three decades, according to tax returns released by his campaign last month. He has said he paid a higher rate than the Clintons, though he earned less income. Both candidates are in the top 1 percent of taxpayers, who paid an average of 30.2 percent between 1981 and 2011, according to figures from the Congressional Budget Office. The average for middle-income households in that time was 16.6 percent. The financial release came just hours after Lisa Bardack, an internist and chairwoman of the Department of Medicine at the Mount Kisco Medical Group near the candidates suburban New York home, publicly detailed Clintons health in a two-page letter. The report said that Clinton, who is 67, has fully recovered from a concussion she suffered in December 2012 after fainting, an episode that Bardack attributed to a stomach virus and dehydration. During the course of her concussion treatment, Clinton was also found to have a blood clot and was given medication to dissolve it. She remains on the medicine as a precaution, Bardack wrote. The blood clot, which was in a vein in the space between the brain and the skull behind the right ear, led Clinton to spend a few days in New York-Presbyterian Hospital and take a month-long absence from the State Department for treatment. Republican strategist Karl Rove later cast the incident as a \"serious health episode\" that would be an issue if Clinton ran for president, fueling a theory that the concussion posed a graver threat to her abilities than Clinton and her team let on. Bardack said testing the following year showed \"complete resolution\" of the concussions effects, including double vision, which Clinton wore glasses with special lenses to address. According to her doctors assessment, Clintons cholesterol and blood pressure are in normal, healthy ranges, and she has had the major cancer screenings and exams recommended for someone her age. She has a very common thyroid condition and seasonal allergies, and takes a blood thinner - Coumadin - as a precaution since her fall and the blood clot. There was no mention of Clintons height or weight. \"Theres no red flags there,\" said Mark Creager, director of the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Heart & Vascular Center in Lebanon, N.H. and president of the American Heart Association. Clintons doctor said she exercises regularly - practicing yoga, swimming, walking, and weight training - and eats a diet rich in lean proteins, vegetables, and fruits. She does not smoke and drinks alcohol \"occasionally,\" Bardack wrote. ]", "Date": "20150801", "Title": "[Clinton releases tax, health records on busy Friday]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150801_Clinton_releases_tax__health_records_on_busy_Friday.html\n", "Author": "[Lisa Lerer, Associated Press]"}

{"Content": "[NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump is staking his run for U.S. president in part on a vow to protect American jobs. But this month, one of his companies, the elite Mar-a-Lago Club resort in Florida, applied to import 70 foreign workers to serve as cooks, wait staff and cleaners. A Reuters analysis of U.S. government data reveals that this is business as usual in the New York property magnates empire. Trump owns companies that have sought to import at least 1,100 foreign workers on temporary visas since 2000, according to U.S. Department of Labor data reviewed by Reuters. Most of the applications were approved, the data show. Nine companies majority-owned by Trump have sought to bring in foreign waitresses, cooks, vineyard workers and other laborers on temporary work-visa programs administered by the Labor Department. The candidates foreign talent hunt included applications for an assistant golf-course superintendent, an assistant hotel manager and a banquet manager. Two of his companies, Trump Model Management and Trump Management Group LLC, have sought visas for nearly 250 foreign fashion models, the records show. Trumps presidential campaign and a lawyer for the businessman declined to comment. The Mar-a-Lago Club could not be reached for comment. The analysis of Trumps history of actively importing foreign workers comes as he has emerged as an early front-runner in the race for the Republican nomination in the November 2016 presidential election. Trump has positioned himself as a champion of American workers whose livelihoods are threatened by illegal foreign laborers and the offshoring of U.S. jobs. I will be the greatest jobs president that God every created,\" he said in announcing his candidacy on June 16. \"I will bring back our jobs from China, Mexico and other places. I will bring back jobs and our money.\", Trump generated both notoriety and buzz by singling out Mexican immigrants in the United States. When Mexico sends its people, theyre not sending their best,\" he said in the speech. \"Theyre bringing drugs. Theyre bringing crime. Theyre rapists.\", In a speech on July 11, Trump distinguished between those working legally and illegally in the United States, saying thousands of \"legal\" Mexicans - \"incredible people\" - have worked for him over the years. The Labor Department records dont specify the nationality of the foreign workers sought by companies. But Trump could be bringing many Mexican workers into the United States. Reuters examined records of applications for three categories of temporary work visas - the H-2A, H-2B and H-1B programs - submitted by employers to the Labor Department. A CONTROVERSIAL VISA PROGRAM, The temporary work visa program through which Trumps companies have sought the greatest numbers of workers, H-2B, brings in mostly workers from Mexico. Mexicans made up more than 80 percent of the 104,993 admissions to the United States on H-2B visas in 2013. The Trump companies have sought at least 850 H-2B visa workers. The H-2B program, which receives little government oversight, is used by companies in sectors ranging from hospitality to forestry to hire foreign workers for temporary jobs. Companies must prove that the jobs are seasonal - and that they tried and failed to hire Americans. U.S. government watchdogs have criticized the H-2B and H-2A programs over the years for failing to protect foreign and American workers alike. In 2003, the Labor Department Inspector General said: Abuses of these programs may result in economic harm to American workers and businesses, exploitation of foreign workers, and security risks associated with aliens who are admitted to this country by fraudulent means. This year, the Government Accountability Office published a report saying that workers in the country on H-2A and H-2B visas have experienced abuse, including being charged illegal recruiting fees, substandard housing and low pay. The Mar-a-Lago, a luxury resort in Palm Beach, Florida, has sought the most foreign workers of the nine Trump businesses: 787 workers since 2006, according to the data. This month, the resort filed paperwork seeking to bring in 70 foreign workers later this year on H-2B visas to serve as maids, cooks and wait staff, according to paperwork known as job orders published on the Labor Departments web site. In addition to the resort and the modeling agencies, the Trump-owned companies identified in the Reuters analysis were Jupiter Golf Club, Lamington Farm Club LLC, Trump Miami Resorts Management LLC, Trump National Golf Club LLC, Trump Payroll Chicago LLC and Trump Vineyard Estates LLC. ]", "Date": "20150801", "Title": "[Donald Trump's companies have sought visas to import at least 1,100 workers]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150801_Reuters_Report_KCN0Q62RQ_Exclusive__Donald_Trump_s_companies_have_sought_visas_to_import_at_least_1_100_workers.html\n", "Author": "[Mica Rosenberg, Ryan McNeill, Megan Twohey and Michelle Conlin, Reuters]"}

{"Content": "[WASHINGTON (AP) - Republicans seeking their partys 2016 presidential nomination have the challenging task of trying to stand out among the 17 candidates in the race, and Thursdays televised debate was the first opportunity for the party to start whittling down its choices. So its no surprise that the candidates had a vested interest in puffing up their own records as governors, senators and public figures. And some of them just got the facts wrong. Some of the claims in the Cleveland debate and how they compare with the facts:, DONALD TRUMP: \"If it werent for me, you wouldnt even be talking about illegal immigration.\", THE FACTS: Republicans have been talking about immigration for at least 30 years, including former President George W. Bush and the Republican field in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. In 2013, an immigration overhaul seeking to address illegal immigration passed the Senate with strong Republican support, although the House never took it up. And Republican debate about immigration has only intensified in the wake of President Barack Obamas sweeping executive action shielding from deportation millions of immigrants in the U.S. illegally. ___, JEB BUSH, on his goal of 4 percent economic growth: \"We can do this.\", THE FACTS: Most economists say the U.S. under any president is unlikely to grow consistently at even close to 4 percent, largely due to the difficulty of overcoming decades-long trends. Current forecasts put growth averaging half the rate of Bushs goal. To grow the economy faster, the country must either add more workers or increase their efficiency so their time on the job generates more income. The retirement of the baby boom generation will shrink the number of workers in the economy, making a huge increase of new employees unlikely. Only four of the 16 presidential terms since World War II have experienced annual economic growth averaging more than 4 percent after inflation, according to research published last year by Princeton University economists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson. ___, BUSH: \"You get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something that doesnt suppress wages and kill jobs.\", THE FACTS: According to the Labor Department, the unemployment rate was 9.9 percent in March 2010, when Obama signed the Affordable Care Act. In June of this year, it had fallen to 5.3 percent. The economy has added more than 12 million jobs since March 2010. While the health care law doesnt seem to have had a major impact on jobs, some lesser consequences are likely. The Congressional Budget Office projected that having government subsidized health insurance will prompt some people to leave the labor market, since they can get coverage without a job. And although Republicans may be able to repeal Obamas law, its unclear if and how they would replace it. The party has yet to rally behind a plan of its own, partly because of internal ideological differences. Some Republicans say it would be the 2016 presidential nominees job to forge a consensus. ___, TRUMP: \"Were giving them (Iran) $150 billion plus\" in sanctions relief under the nuclear deal. THE FACTS: That might be an exaggeration. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew has said Iran has $100 billion in foreign reserves that its been unable to access. After sanctions relief, Treasury estimates that Iran will be able to freely access about half of that $100 billion. He said more than $20 billion is inaccessible because it is committed to projects with China and tens of billions of other restricted funds are in non-performing loans to Irans energy and banking sector. ___, CHRIS CHRISTIE: \"We brought the budget into balance with no tax increases.\", THE FACTS: Not exactly. As New Jerseys governor, Christie in his first term cut the earned income tax credit, which largely benefits low-income workers, from 25 percent of the federal credit to 20 percent. He surprised Democrats this summer by proposing to bring it up to 30 percent. Democrats quickly approved the change. Christie also repeatedly delayed implementing the Homestead credit program, which grants property tax relief, even as he capped property tax increases overall. He also extended the sales tax on online purchases to out-of-state retailers and pushed for higher taxes on e-cigarettes, but failed. So while Christie indeed vetoed a number of proposed tax increases, his record isnt free of hikes in taxes or their close cousin: fees. ___, TRUMP: \"I built a net worth of more than $10 billion.\", THE FACTS: Trumps precise net worth has long been a moving target. Documents filed with the Federal Election Commission put Trumps wealth at $8.7 billion. But the form requires disclosures of value ranges, not precise sums. The FEC also doesnt specify how to value real estate, leaving Trump free to assess many of his proprieties in the highest bracket - over $50 million. Trump argues many of his properties are worth even more, a claim that cannot be verified without access to his private documents. Hes valued his personal brand and marketing deals at $3.3 billion. Yet other assessments put his wealth at far less. Forbes Magazine valued his brand at just $125 million, and last month, Bloomberg News estimated his total worth at $2.9 billion. ___, BUSH: \"During my eight years in office, 1.3 million jobs were created, and we left the state better off.\", FACT CHECK: Yes, but by December 2009, 900,000 of those 1.3 million jobs had been eliminated. During Bushs tenure as governor, the state benefited from a huge housing bubble that then burst just as he left the governors mansion. Home prices jumped 160 percent in Florida from 1999 through 2006 - more than double the national increase of 74 percent -according to real estate data provider Zillow. That growth fueled a 50 percent jump in construction jobs, and the boost to home values made many Floridians feel wealthier, leading them to spend more. Home prices started to fall in 2006, Bushs last year in office. ___, BEN CARSON: \"Our Navy is at its smallest size since 1970, our Air Force since 1940.\", THE FACTS: Actually, the U.S. Air Force was created in 1947. Created initially as the Aeronautical Division of the U.S. Army Signal Corps in 1907, the force went through a number of iterations before becoming a full-fledged branch of the military equal to the Army and the Navy in the wake of World War II. A dearth of reliable public data makes it difficult to examine Carsons broader argument that the militarys capacity is smaller now than in 1940. But its true that the number of U.S. military aircraft has diminished in recent decades. ___, Associated Press writers Alicia A. Caldwell, Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Deb Riechmann, Christopher S.

{"Content": "[CLEVELAND (AP) - The Latest on the first Republican debate of the 2016 campaign for president:, ___, 10:55 p.m. He opened the GOP debate, and billionaire presidential candidate Donald Trump closed it by promising to fix America. \"We cant do anything right,\" he said, adding that \"we dont win anymore\" against China, Japan or Mexico on trade. Trump has been criticized for, among other things, lacking a detailed policy platform. He was the last to speak at the debate, and Trump closed by promising to strengthen the military, take care of veterans, end Obamacare and make \"our country great again.\", ___, 10:45 p.m. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio earned some of the loudest applause of Thursdays first GOP debate when he offered a zinger hitting Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton. \"Well, first let me say, I think God has blessed us. Hes blessed the Republican Party with some very good candidates,\" he said. \"The Democrats cant even find one.\", Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, meanwhile, said he has tried to act as God wanted him to as hes taken difficult political actions during his governorship. Walker said he is \"not a perfect man,\" but he has tried to act with respect. \"What God calls us to do is follow his will,\" he said. \"And, ultimately, thats what Im going to try to do. And I hope people have seen that in my state.\", Walker said even when he drew over 100,000 protesters at the state Capitol while he was \"trying to do the right thing,\" he acted in an upright manner. __, 10:40 p.m. Ohio Gov. John Kasich (KAY-sik) received a rousing round of applause during Thursdays first presidential debate when he said he can disagree with someone on same-sex marriage and still love them. Asked how he would explain his opposition to gay marriage to a child who announced he or she was gay or lesbian, the presidential contender said: \"Im going to love my daughters no matter what they do. Because you know what? God gives me unconditional love, and Im going to give it to my family and my friends and the people around me.\", Kasich said he believes marriage is between a man and a woman but he urged his states residents to respect the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that made same-sex marriage a nationwide right. The lead plaintiff in the landmark case was an Ohioan. Shortly after the ruling, Kasich attended a gay wedding. Earlier Thursday in Cleveland, plaintiff Jim Obergefell urged candidates in the first presidential debate to validate the decision. Kasich said he wants to unite people and \"issues like that are planted to divide us.\", ___, 10:31 p.m. Billionaire Donald Trump isnt bothering making his bellicose manner more polite, even if former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush doesnt like his tone. \"We dont have time for tone,\" Trump said Thursday at the GOP debate, referencing Islamic militants beheading Christians. \"Weve got to get out and get the job done.\", Trump is atop the polls but has been criticized by Bush for being too negative and angry. Bush was widely viewed as the front-runner before Trumps rise. Bush said the nominee needs to be positive and not divide the country like President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton do. ___, 10:25 p.m. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is emphasizing his opposition to abortion. He says he believes future generations will \"call us barbarians for murdering millions of babies.\", Rubio disputes the Republican presidential debate moderators characterization that he opposes abortion except in the case of rape and incest. He says he has never advocated for those exceptions. ___, 10:18 p.m. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has no apologies about four of his businesses filing for bankruptcy. Trump said he was acting like any other successful businessman in \"taking advantage\" of the nations laws. He spoke during the first GOP presidential debate in response to a question from Fox News host Chris Wallace. Wallace pressed Trump further. He noted that the most recent bankruptcy filing of a Trump corporation cost hundreds of jobs and deprived lenders of $1 billion. Trump responded that the lenders were \"killers\" and said Wallace was \"living in a dream world.\" He added that he has never personally declared bankruptcy. Trump concluded that his business skills would come in handy in the White House given that the United States is trillions of dollars in debt. ___, 10:10 p.m. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is defending his lofty goal of achieving 4 percent economic growth, a rate last reached more than a generation ago. At Thursdays GOP debate, Bush said the threshold, which also includes 19 million new jobs by a second Bush term, is possible by simplifying the tax code, repealing Democratic President Barack Obamas 2010 health care law and accelerating domestic energy production by reducing regulations on the oil and gas industry. But a key part of Bushs economic plan is perhaps one of its most controversial among Republicans: an immigration system that puts people who are now illegally in the country on legal job and tax rolls. He would do that by allowing people in the country illegally to stay in the country by seeking permanent legal status, in part by working, learning English and paying fines. He says, \"Fixing our immigration system and making it an economic driver is part of this.\", __, 10 p.m. Ohio Gov. John Kasich says the winning presidential Republican nominee must take a broad, pro-growth stance if the party wants to beat Democrat Hillary Clinton. But he says economic prosperity is meant to be shared with the less fortunate. Asked during Thursdays first presidential debate on Fox News, Kasich was asked how to answer Democratic criticism that Republicans favor the wealthy and do too little for the poor. \"Economic growth is the key to everything, but once you have economic growth you have to reach out to the people in the shadows,\" the former congressman said. Describing himself as the son of a mailman, Kasich predicted Clinton would take a narrow line of arguments against the GOP and said Republicans vision should be expansive. \"Restore the sense that the miracle will apply to you,\" he said. \"Lift everybody. Unite everybody. And build a strong United States of America again.\", ___, 9:55 p.m. Florida Gov. Jeb Bush heard boos at Thursdays Republican presidential debate when the moderator said he is the lone candidate on stage who supports education standards known as Common Core. Bush says he believes education should be a state responsibility and says education standards should be higher. If states dont want to take part in the Common Core standards, he says thats fine. \"I dont believe the federal government should be involved in the creation of standards directly or indirectly,\" he says. But the former Florida governor is strongly defending the idea of standards created at the state level. Bush says: \"If we are going to compete in this world were in today, theres no possible way we can do it with lowering expectations and dumbing down everything. Children are going to suffer and families hearts are going to be broken that their kids wont be able to get a job in the 21st century.\", Bush says that as governor he created the first statewide school voucher program in the country, emphasizing that he fought teachers unions to do so. He says students and parents should have \"real school choice.\", ___, 9:50 p.m. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump says he no longer supports a single-payer system for health care and defends his donations to Democratic politicians. At the Republican presidential debate in Cleveland, Trump said single-payer works well in countries such as Canada and could have worked in the U.S. when he supported it in the 1990s. He says he now favors lessening state regulations of insurance to foster greater competition. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul jabbed back at Trumps answer by noting that Republicans have fought single-payer for a decade. Trump gave a withering response: \"I dont think you heard me. Youre having a hard time tonight.\", Trump was also asked about his past donations to Democratic politicians, including that they led them to \"do whatever the hell you want.\", Trumps reply: \"You better believe it.\", He adds, \"I call them, they are there for me. And thats a broken system.\" He said his donation to Democratic frontrunner Hillary Rodham Clinton got her to attend his wedding. ___, 9:46 p.m. Ben Carson has one of the quips of the night so far at the first GOP presidential debate in Cleveland. He was asked whether he would support a return to using waterboarding to obtain information from terrorists. His response: \"Thank you. ... I wasnt sure I was going to get to talk again.\", With 10 candidates on stage, theres a lot of space between when each gets a turn to speak. Carson, by the way, didnt say where he stood on the issue, saying he didnt think it was wise to telegraph Americas military strategy to its enemies. ___, 9:42 p.m. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul fundamentally disagree about the collection of telephone records. But the policy difference about constitutional rights versus national security is turning personal. Christie, a former U.S. attorney, says: \"Im the only person on this stage whos actually filed applications under the Patriot Act. ... This is not theoretical to me. I went to the funerals.\", Paul blasted back, \"You fundamentally misunderstand the Bill of Rights.\" He shouted across the stage to Christie: \"Use the Fourth Amendment! Get a warrant! Get a judge to sign a warrant!\", Christie slammed Pauls Senate filibuster, saying, \"When youre sitting in a subcommittee blowing hot air about this you can say things about that.\", ___, 9:40 p.m. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is defending his statement last year that people in this country illegally have committed \"an act of love.\", During the GOP presidential debate, Bush said most people staying in the country illegally are trying to provide for their family, a position that earned him groans from the audience in the Quicken Loans Arena. But Bush says fixing the immigration system is more important than figuring out why people are in the country illegally. And Bush has called for limiting legal immigration based on family ties, and expanding it for economic reasons. Bush, whose wife is a naturalized Mexican immigrant, says: \"Theres much to do. Rather than talking about this as a wedge issue, the next president will fix this once and for all, as a driver for high, sustained economic growth.\", ___, 9:35 p.m. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio says many U.S. citizens feel taken advantage of when it comes to immigration. \"This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration,\" he said Thursday, speaking from the stage at the first GOP presidential debate, televised nationally on Fox News. He took issue with celebrity businessman Donald Trumps assertion the Mexico is to blame for Americas illegal immigration problem. Most illegal immigrants, Rubio says, are coming from countries such as Guatamala and El Salvador and are overstaying their welcome, as opposed to sneaking over the border. Rubio says his Senate office takes phone calls frequently with people who are frustrated with the slow legal immigration process and wonder if they should just come illegally. ___, 9:30 p.m. Billionaire real estate mogul Donald Trump isnt backing down on his allegations that Mexico is sending criminals into the United States. Fox News host Chris Wallace challenged Trump to provide evidence of that charge during the first GOP presidential debate. Trump snapped back that if it wasnt for him, no one would be talking about illegal immigration. He said that U.S. Border Patrol agents have told him the Mexican government is sending criminals to the U.S. because they know the government in America is \"stupid.\", Trump says, \"they say this is whats happening because our leaders are stupid, our politicians are stupid. And the Mexican government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning. He adds, \"they send the bad ones over, because they dont want to pay for them, they dont want to take care of them. Why should they, when the stupid leaders of the United States will do it for em.\", Ohio Gov. John Kasich said that Trumps immigration comments have clearly touched a nerve and it is \"a mistake\" for people to ignore him. ___, 9:26 p.m. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is says executive experience is not a requirement for president. The remark came in response to a question about kind comments Rubio had made about in-state rival Jeb Bushs record as governor. \"I would add to that this election cannot be a resume competition,\" Rubio retorted sharply. \"This election better be about the future, not the past.\", Rubios reply is not just a jab at Bush, but also against Democratic favorite Hillary Clinton. Rubio said if the election is a competition between people with government experience then Clinton, a former senator and former secretary of state, would win in 2016. Rubio remarked that he was raised in a working class home in Miami. \"How is Hillary Clinton going to lecture me on living paycheck to paycheck? I was raised to paycheck to paycheck.\", ___, 9:20 p.m. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee says defunding Planned Parenthood is only one strategy for addressing revelations contained in recently released videos. Huckabee proposed during Thursdays debate he would like to see the Constitution adjusted to protect the rights of unborn children. \"Its time we admit the Supreme Court is not the supreme being,\" he said. An anti-abortion group released several secretly shot videos with Planned Parenthood executives describing how the organization provides fetal tissue to medical researchers and discussing different procedures and prices. Planned Parenthood executives have denied claims that the transactions were sales and said any donations are legal and ethical. The law allows abortion providers to be paid for processing fees but not to profit from fetal tissue. ___, 9:15 p.m. Billionaire real estate mogul and Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump is making no apologies for his past crude comments about women. At the first GOP presidential debate Fox news host Megyn Kelly sharply questioned how Trump has described women in the past, criticizing their bodies and making sexually suggestive statements on his television show. Trump tried to joke initially, saying the statements were only about liberal actor Rosie ODonnell. But he said testily that he didnt have time for \"total political correctness.\", Staying combative, he said that if Kelly didnt like it, \"Im sorry.\" He added that hes always said nice things about her, but he threatened to be less kind to her in retaliation. \"Ive been challenged by so many people and I dont frankly have time for total political correctness,\" he said. \"This country is in big trouble. We dont win anymore.\", ___, 9:05 p.m. The opening moments of the first debate of the 2016 presidential election are all about Donald Trump, who refused to rule out running as an independent. At center stage, the GOP frontrunner was the only one of 10 candidates to raise his hands when the Fox News hosts asked if anyone onstage would not pledge to support the eventual party nominee. \"I will not make the pledge at this time,\" Trump said. That enraged Sen. Rand Paul, who said Trump was \"already hedging his bets because hes used to buying politicians.\", Trump had already loomed over the events Thursday night. During an earlier event for candidates relegated to a discussion outside of prime time, Trump took shots for his past positions in favor of universal health care and abortion rights. Ohio Gov. John Kasich got a standing ovation from the home-state crowd.]", "Date": "20150806", "Title": "[The Latest: Trump ends with 'We can't do anything right']", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150806_ap_4a650e90ebc44f8daa6b653745e20742.html\n", "Author": "[The Associated Press, The Associated Press]"}

{"Content": "[WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was dumped from a prime speaking role to an important gathering of conservative activists on Friday for his criticism of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly after a combustible debate performance. Trump was scheduled to deliver the keynote address on Saturday night at a conference in Atlanta organized by Red State, an influential conservative group. Red State chief Erick Erickson said he had disinvited Trump from the event because of what he described as \"demeaning\" remarks about Kelly who was one of three moderators during the first major Republican debate on Thursday night in Cleveland. \"While I have tried to give him great latitude, his remark about Megyn Kelly was a bridge too far,\" Erickson said, adding he had invited Kelly, one of Foxs highest profile anchors, to attend his conference in Trumps place. Trump was unbowed by the dumping. \"This is just another example of weakness through being politically correct,\" his campaign said in a statement. \"For all of the people who were looking forward to Mr. Trump coming, we will miss you. Blame Erick Erickson, your weak and pathetic leader. Well now be doing another campaign stop at another location.\", During the debate, Kelly asked Trump to respond to derogatory statements he had made in the past about women, calling them \"fat pigs\" for example. Trump tried to wave off the question and dismissed Kelly during a raucous debate performance. \"And honestly Megyn, if you dont like it, Im sorry,\" Trump said. \"Ive been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be, based on the way you have treated me. But I wouldnt do that.\", Erickson said in a Facebook statement that in a CNN interview Trump said of Kelly: \"You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes. Blood coming out of her wherever.\", \"His comment was inappropriate,\" said Erickson. \"It is unfortunate to have to disinvite him. But I just dont want someone on stage who gets a hostile question from a lady and his first inclination is to imply it was hormonal. It just was wrong,\" he said. \"He is not a professional politician and is known for being a blunt talker. But there are even lines blunt talkers and unprofessional politicians should not cross. Decency is one of those lines.\", A variety of Republican presidential candidates have been speaking at the Red State gathering in Atlanta and Trump was scheduled for a prominent appearance. Shortly before Ericksons statement, Trumps campaign had just put out a media advisory with the schedule for Trumps appearance. The New York billionaire has been riding high in the polls in recent weeks as Republican search for their nominee to face the Democrats choice in the November 2016 election.

{"Content": "[DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - Sampling the pork chop on a stick. Snapping a selfie with the butter cow. Taking questions about foreign policy from hecklers. For those who would be president, a visit to the Iowa State Fair may be the purest distillation of the campaign experience in the state that starts the voting in the race for the White House. The 11-day event starts Thursday, and most of the 2016 hopefuls will pass through, pausing to chomp on deep-fried snack foods, visit with locals out for a day of fun and spend some time on the political soapbox to talk with voters. If all goes well, the fair provides an opportunity for a candidate to have candid interaction with voters and shows off a side of him or her not often seen on TV. People fondly remember Barack Obamas ride on the bumper cars with his family in 2007. But in the increasingly stage-managed world of presidential politics, awkward moments and ill-timed soundbites can flow from this unscripted setting. \"Its an important thing for candidates to do,\" said Tom Henderson, chairman of the Democratic Party in Iowas Polk County. \"The pitfall is that in prior years, the real news story has been hecklers, which leads to quotes the candidates have to answer for.\", Consider the case of Mitt Romney, who during the last campaign said atop The Des Moines Registers soapbox: \"Corporations are people, my friend.\" The comment dogged Romney, the former private equity executive, for the rest of his campaign. This year, more than a dozen candidates for president are scheduled take their turn on the soapbox, among them Republicans Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and Marco Rubio. Democrats Bernie Sanders and Martin OMalley will, too. Will Hillary Rodham Clinton? Shes coming to the fair, but hasnt yet said if shell take a turn on the box. Iowa is already a place where even the most cautious-minded and carefully managed political candidate can have unexpected, intimate and sometimes just plain weird moments with the public. At campaign stops in recent months, Bush held hands and prayed with a flower-laden man in a top hat, Walker embraced a sobbing homeless military veteran and Clinton graciously accepted garlic pills from a supporter concerned for her health. The fair only amplifies the Iowa experience. Will Rogers, GOP chairman of Polk County, called it \"the Iowa culture crammed into 10 days.\", For Republicans, the cancellation of the traditional Iowa Straw Poll makes the fair an even more important destination. The poll had been a mainstay of the GOP presidential primary since 1979, raising money for the state party and culling the field of candidates. It was a weak predictor of candidate success in Iowas caucuses, however, and some major candidates skipped it. The Iowa GOP decided in June to drop the poll. \"Not all candidates are going to appear natural and comfortable at a state fair. There is an element here of being able to interact with an average person on a hot August day,\" said Jeff Kaufmann, chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa. A cheerleader for all things Iowa, Republican Gov. Terry Branstad waxed poetic about the benefit of a good fair appearance, remembering his trip to the event last year with Joni Ernst, then a state senator, now a U.S. senator. \"I can tell you, she really connected,\" Branstad said. \"People were coming up to Joni and hugging her.

{"Content": "[By Eric M. Johnson, SEATTLE (Reuters) - With his parents out of work and an office job paying his bills, college junior Shane Bang remembers the anxiety he felt when his younger brother told his family he was headed to University of Washington in the fall. Then they got an unexpected lifeline. A law that took effect last month slashed tuition at public colleges and universities over the next two academic years as much as 20 percent for all Washington students, rich and poor alike. They were the only such cost-cuts in the nation in 2015, and the first in the states history, Republicans say, and will save the family $6,981, by university estimates. \"Well all have less pressure,\" Bang said. For the last academic year, a Washington student paid about $12,000 in tuition and mandatory fees to attend the states two flagship universities. That is higher than the U.S. average of $9,139 for in-state students at public four-year institutions, but less than New Hampshire schools which average $14,712, the nations costliest, according to the nonprofit College Board. Washingtons cuts, praised as \"historic\" by Republicans and as a \"great move\" by U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan, come after decades during which public college tuition bills grew faster than inflation, according to data from the board, which administers the SAT entrance exam. Total undergraduate debt has ballooned over the last 10 years, propelled by stagnant family income, the board reported. States cut funding for higher education for several years across the country beginning with the Great Recession of 2008, and state lawmakers and governing boards increased tuition to help compensate for any shortfalls. As the United States slowly recovered from the recession, many states opted to freeze tuition or cap increases, said Thomas Harnisch, a policy analyst with the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. Per-student higher education funding levels are still below pre-recession ones in all but three states, and, as of the last school year, Washington was among 10 states that had made the biggest cuts since 2008, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank. Harnisch said it unlikely that other states would copy Washingtons cuts, signed by Democratic Governor Jay Inslee in late June. This year, only Minnesota trimmed community college tuition, by 1 percent. By comparison, Washington lowered community college tuition by 5 percent, in addition to cutting tuition at public universities. It also tied future tuition increases to a 2.1 percent annual growth rate for median hourly wages, derived from a 14-year trailing average. \"In eight years of following education policy in the United States, Ive never seen anything close to what Washington has done,\" Harnisch said. MONTHS-LONG NEGOTIATIONS, The tuition reset has been praised by students and the states flagship universities, as well as by Republican activists eying next falls election, when the chief Republican budget writer, Senator Andy Hill, is among three favorites talked about as challengers to Inslee. State Republicans put forward the proposal as their core budget goal after winning control of the upper chamber last November, said its architect, Senator John Braun. \"Higher ed is one of the key drivers of economic mobility,\" said Braun. The cuts were initially opposed by House Democrats, who controlled the lower chamber and viewed them as a \"throwaway offer\" at the onset of months-long budget negotiations, said Representative Ross Hunter, the chief budget writer for the Democratic majority. The Democrats rebuffed the initial Republican proposal because it would have cut tuition at prestigious universities by taking money from a grant program and raising tuition at community colleges, while forgoing new taxes, Hunter said. \"I would have preferred to increase the money we spent on student aid, so that we can help first-generation people go to college,\" Hunter said. Ultimately, boosted by huge tax-revenue forecasts, lawmakers funded the roughly $220 million in tuition cuts using unexpected federal funds, by closing tax loopholes and by levying taxes on out-of-state and online sales, among other revenue sources, Hunter said. Some education policy analysts agreed that more could have been done to help the poorest get into, and pay for, college. Ben Wildavsky, a policy professor at State University of New York at Albany, said Washington states cuts will likely give a \"windfall to more affluent families.\", University of Washington campus Republicans plan to trumpet the cuts in the hope of drawing new members and say they will be useful to mention as they try to sway voters in Seattles Democratic-leaning King County. Chris Vance, a former chairman of the states Republican Party, said the cuts mean his own daughter will save about $2,000 over the next two years at Washington State University. \"Putting more money into education without raising taxes is music to the ears of suburban voters,\" Vance said.

{"Content": "[WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has so far identified 305 emails from Hillary Clintons private server used while she was secretary of state to be reviewed for potentially classified information, the agency said in a court filing on Monday. It said the emails referred for review came from a sample of about 20 percent of the Clinton emails screened to determine if they can be released publicly. Last December, Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic Party nomination in the 2016 presidential election, handed over about 30,000 emails she sent and received while Americas top diplomat. Clintons use of her private email while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 came to light in March and drew fire from political opponents who accused her of sidestepping transparency and record-keeping laws. The FBI was looking into the security of the federal records and classified information contained among Clintons emails. The U.S. government considers federal records to be government property. The Justice Department has said the FBI investigation began after a government watchdog said at least four emails out of a sample of 40 he inspected contained classified information, including two that contained information deemed \"top secret,\" the highest classification level. Clinton has said she did not send or receive any secret information using that account. The government forbids the sending of classified information outside unsecured networks because it could harm national security if intercepted. After months of pressure, Clinton last week gave the FBI her private email server and a thumb drive of work-related emails from her tenure. Asked about the additional emails being reviewed by intelligence agencies, State Department John Kirby told a media briefing on Monday: \"Its a healthy thing.\", \"It doesnt mean that all 300 are going to end up at some level of (classification upgrade).I suspect some will and I suspect some wont,\" Kirby said.

{"Content": "[WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. businessman Donald Trump, the leading Republican presidential candidate, on Thursday said he would not back a higher minimum wage for American workers as such a move would hurt the nations economic competitiveness. In a televised interview on MSNBC, Trump, a real estate mogul and TV personality, said the United States needed low wages and taxes to be competitive with other countries. \"Having a low minimum wage is not a bad thing for this country,\" Trump said. \"We cant have a situation where our labor is so much more expensive than other countries that we can no longer win.\", His comments contrast with growing local efforts to boost minimum wages across the country, given stalled movement of the issue in Washington. Any change in the national minimum wage, set at $7.25 an hour since 2009, would need the support of the Republican-controlled Congress and is considered unlikely. Many companies limited wage hikes during the 2007-2009 recession. But even as hiring has rebounded amid an economic recovery, wages have yet to catch up. This hampers U.S. productivity, some experts have said. Now Democrats, labor and religious groups are pressing their case for pay raises to state and local governments. Last month, New York and Washington, D.C. moved to raise their minimum wage to $15 an hour, and Los Angeles in June said it would lift its lowest hourly wage to $15 by 2020. Other cities, including Seattle and San Francisco have already boosted minimum pay. Trump, speaking on MSNBCs \"Morning Joe\" program, said the costs of U.S. labor and taxes were sending companies not just to different U.S. states, but outside the country, in search of better deals. The Republican candidate, one of 17 looking to win the partys presidential nomination for the 2016 election, has stirred controversy for his comments on immigration and has vowed to bring jobs back to the United States that have moved overseas, although he has yet to offer a detailed economic plan. Asked about another pay issue - equal pay for women and men - Trump said everyone should have equal access to capital but it was hard to tell if men and women were doing the same work. \"If they do the same job, they should get the same pay. But its very hard to say what is the same job,\" he said.

{"Content": "[WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More prominent Democrats on Sunday cracked open the door for Vice President Joe Biden to enter the race for the Democratic presidential nomination as party front-runner Hillary Clinton battled questions over her use of a private email server. California Governor Jerry Brown told NBCs Meet the Press program that, if he were Biden, he would give \"very serious consideration\" to a presidential run. Brown said the email saga surrounding Clintons private email server as Secretary of State carried a \"dark energy\" that represents a substantial challenge for her campaign. \"It is almost like a vampire. She is going to have to put a stake...in the heart of these emails,\" the California Democrat said. Asked if Biden should run, Brown said: \"You are asking me presidential advice. All I can say is if I were Hillary, I would say dont jump in. If I were Joe Biden, I would probably give it very serious consideration.\", Speculation grew on Saturday that Biden may soon challenge Clinton for the Democratic nomination as the vice president met with Senator Elizabeth Warren, a power broker among liberal Democrats. Warren, who has strong support from liberal groups that would be critical to winning in early voting states, has said she will not run for president herself, but she has not endorsed Clinton or any other Democratic candidate. Josh Alcorn, a senior adviser for Draft Biden 2016, a Super PAC group that is laying groundwork for a potential run, said the vice president was \"sounding out people in early (primary election) states, activists and potential supporters.\", Meeting with Warren could help give Biden more ideas for making the U.S. economy work better for middle-class Americans, he told Fox News Sunday. If Biden decides to run, Alcorn said it would be important for him to announce his candidacy in time take part in the first Democratic debates in October. Democratic presidential candidate Martin OMalley said he had a \"great deal of respect\" for Biden. \"It would be nice to have at least one more lifelong Democrat in the race,\" the former Maryland governor told ABCs This Week with George Stephanopoulos. The comment was partially a reference to independent Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-declared socialist from Vermont, who is also seeking the Democratic nomination. Former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson on Sunday told ABCs \"This Week\" program that he would endorse Clinton in her bid to win the November 2016 presidential election, but said Biden would be a formidable candidate if he entered the race.

{"Content": "[(Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush said on Monday it was ludicrous to describe his use of the term \"anchor babies\" as offensive to immigrants, saying his original comments referred more to Asians coming to the United States to give birth. Bushs remarks came at a news conference in McAllen, Texas, near the border with Mexico, where he was asked whether using the \"anchor babies\" term in a radio interview last week could affect his ability to win Hispanic votes. \"My background, my life, the fact that Im immersed in the immigrant experience, this is ludicrous for the Clinton campaign and others to suggest that somehow Im using a derogatory term,\" said Bush, whose wife was born in Mexico and who answered some questions in Spanish, \"What I was talking about was the specific case of fraud being committed where theres organized efforts - frankly its more related to Asian people coming into our country, having children in that organized effort, taking advantage of a noble concept, which is birthright citizenship,\" he said. The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution grants citizenship to any child born on U.S. soil, regardless of parentage. Immigration critics sometimes use \"anchor babies\" to describe U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, usually from Latin America. Immigration groups say the phrase is offensive. The former Florida governor sounded frustrated to have to address the issue again after telling reporters last week he did not regret using the term because he did not know of a better one. After Bush used the \"anchor babies\" phrase last week, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton criticized him, tweeting: \"Theyre called babies.\", \"I support the 14th Amendment. Nothing about what Ive said should be viewed as derogatory towards immigrants at all,\" Bush told reporters. \"I was focusing on a specific targeted kind of case where people are organizing to bring pregnant women into the country, where theyre having children so their children can become citizens,\" Bush said. \"Thats fraud.\", Federal agents earlier this year described \"maternity tourism\" schemes in which wealthy foreign women, particularly from China, travel to the United States to give birth so their children will have U.S. citizenship. In a statement on Monday, the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans condemned \"the use of the derogatory term anchor babies., Saying that because of actions ranging from the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 \"to now calling us anchor babies, Asian American and Pacific Islander communities continue to be discriminated against as part of larger anti-immigrant rhetoric,\" the group said. Republicans have identified illegal immigration as a key topic for primary voters, but they want to avoid driving away Hispanic voters whose support they will need against the eventual Democratic nominee. Some Republicans seeking the 2016 presidential nomination, including Donald Trump, have criticized across-the-board birthright citizenship. , (Reporting by Emily Stephenson and Peter Cooney; Additional reporting by Curtis Skinner in San Francisco; Editing by Bill Rigby and Leslie Adler)]", "Date": "20150825", "Title": "[Jeb Bush again defends use of 'anchor babies' term, says referred to Asians]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150824_Reuters_Report_KCN0QT2DS_Jeb_Bush_again_defends_use_of__anchor_babies__term__says_referred_to_Asians.html\n", "Author": "[Emily Stephenson, Reuters]"}

{"Content": "[DUBUQUE, Iowa Aug 25 (Reuters) - Thousands of people are expected to stream into an events center here on the banks of the Mississippi River on Tuesday to see Donald Trump. When they do, his presidential campaign will be waiting, looking to convert casual gawkers into hardcore supporters who will cast votes for the billionaire presidential candidate in the Iowa caucuses next year. The Republican frontrunners surging campaign is largely viewed as powered by his personal celebrity and his persistent presence on television. But theres another political upside to being one of the most famous men in America: You dont have to go knocking door-to-door to find voters. They come to you. When those voters enter the Grand River Center on Tuesday evening, they will immediately be diverted to tables where Trumps staff will recruit them to be county precinct captains, organizers, and volunteers. Its a huge competitive advantage in a presidential race where other Republican candidates at times struggle to attract crowds in the hundreds. Its another reason, beyond strong poll numbers, why Trumps candidacy is being viewed with increasing seriousness both inside and outside Iowa, which holds one of the earliest nominating contests in 2016. \"Ive never seen anything like it,\" said Chuck Laudner, Trumps top organizer in Iowa, as he walked the event space with Reuters days prior to the event. \"Hes drawing crowds that most candidates only get in the weeks before the general election.\", Laudner talks like a man who, after years of fighting the political wars in Iowa with a cap gun, has been handed a shoulder-fired missile launcher. In the 2012 election, Laudner drove his pickup truck to every county in the state on behalf of Republican candidate Rick Santorum, who was running a shoestring operation. Santorum ended up pulling off a shocking first-place finish in the caucuses. Skeptics say Trump will fade once voters turn serious about choosing a president come autumn and doubt he has the patience and fortitude to build a grassroots machine not just here but across the country. Celebrity hasnt translated into results in past campaigns here. In the 2008 race, Rudy Giuliani and Fred Thompson, both of whom enjoyed high name recognition, were riding high in summer polls. By the time the caucuses rolled around in January, both had fizzled. WARPING THE RULES, But Trumps star power and personal fortune has warped the traditional rules that govern campaigning in the state, upending the retail politics that Iowa is known for. When Trump landed his helicopter earlier this month at the Iowa State Fair, he was mobbed by a crowd in the thousands. Last week, he almost filled a sports stadium in Mobile, Alabama. \"His reach is just so far beyond what the rest of these guys can do combined,\" Laudner said, referring to Trumps opponents. \"Its all new territory.\", Recent winners of the Iowa caucuses have either been campaigns with large resources and strong organizations, such as George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004, or conservatives who appeal to the evangelicals in the state, such as Santorum and Mike Huckabee, who won in 2008. Trump, like Bush, could have the potential to outspend his rivals here while also appealing to the influential right-wing. His best-funded challenger here, Jeb Bush, is unpopular with those voters. Other businessmen-turned-politicians such as Ross Perot were able to leverage their personas to develop cult followings but were largely disinterested in the dirty day-to-day work of modern campaigns. Trump, instead, appears poised to use his wealth to build a credible ground organization here, starting with the well-respected Laudner. \"Chuck Laudner is a deity among conservative activists,\" said an Iowa Republican consultant who asked not be named because he supports a rival candidate. \"Chuck is somebody who values grassroots mobilization. This is a guy who eats and breathes organizational structure.\", , ALL ABOARD THE TRUMP BUS, Trump has 10 paid staff members in the state and likely will be adding more. One recent innovation has been to send a large tour bus emblazoned with the Trump logo from town to town. It has become its own curiosity, drawing crowds even though just a staffer or two, not Trump, are aboard. The bus even has its own Facebook page. \"Its not the kind of vehicle Mr. Trump would ride through Iowa in, and these folks know that,\" said John Hulsizer, Trumps coordinator for the northeast part of the state. \"But the Trump bus is now acting as a surrogate for Mr. Trump. Its amazing to see 100 or 150 people come out.\", The bus has become another surefire way to make contact with potential voters. \"People are just handing over information left and right in order to get signed up so they can go to caucus for Mr. Trump,\" Hulsizer said. And Trumps staff is committed to traveling the state on behalf of the candidate, he said. \"We want to make sure we hit every county in the state of Iowa.\", Trumps campaign hopes to do what has been a long-held goal of politicians in Iowa: bring new voters into the caucus process. Despite the relentless coverage the contest receives here, about only 120,000 Republicans participated in 2012, 20 percent of the registered Republicans in the state. Laudner and Hulsizer believe Trump could be the candidate to convince so-called Reagan Democrats - blue-collar union voters - to register as Republicans just to vote for him. Trump has made the loss of manufacturing jobs overseas central to his campaign. \"Union guys have a friend in Trump,\" Laudner said. Dubuque features a high concentration of those voters. Its also seen as the base of support in the state for Scott Walker, the governor of nearby Wisconsin, whose presidential poll numbers in Iowa have been tumbling. \"This is not by accident,\" said the Republican consultant. \"Trump is smart to go in there.\" (Reporting by James Oliphant, editing by Ross Colvin)]", "Date": "20150825", "Title": "[RPT-How Trump plans to turn gawkers into hardcore supporters]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150825_Reuters_L1N10Z2PH_RPT_How_Trump_plans_to_turn_gawkers_into_hardcore_supporters.html\n", "Author": "[James Oliphant, Reuters]"}
{"Content": "[* As deficit declines, so does public interest in it, * Biggest funder of anti-deficit movement doesnt waver, * Some U.S. lawmakers eye measures adding to deficit, WASHINGTON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - As the U.S. governments budget deficit has declined, so has anxiety about it in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail, but one family and the Washington \"deficit hawk\" community it bankrolls are unfazed. Among the capitals many activists, few names are as closely linked to one issue as the Peterson family is with attacking the deficit and the federal debt. Yet they face a growing struggle to win attention for the cause as the deficit has shrunk to less than a third of its level when President Barack Obama took office, making it a less pressing issue for politicians and the public alike. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) said on Tuesday the deficit will likely be $426 billion in fiscal 2015 and decline further to $414 billion in fiscal 2016. That would be its lowest level since 2007. The deficit peaked at $1.4 trillion in 2009. Nevertheless, Michael A. Peterson, president of a $1-billion foundation set up in 2008 by his father Peter G. Peterson and devoted to fiscal reform, warns that the long-term federal fiscal picture is still dire and vows to fight on. \"The budget is not front and center right now, and theres not a lot of political will in Washington to solve it right now, but I dont think that means that theres a view that this challenge isnt still a major issue,\" he told Reuters. \"We still have a very significant long-term debt problem.\", Increased tax revenues on a strengthening economy, modest budget restraint imposed since 2011, and sharply reduced spending on foreign wars have all helped bring the deficit down. Still, the CBO projected that the publics holdings of U.S. federal debt - the accumulation of years of deficits - is projected to hit $13.2 trillion this year, up from $12.8 trillion last year, and to rise above $20 trillion by 2025. (Related graphics: http://link.reuters.com/qup45w and http://link.reuters.com/her45w), , PETERSONS UNDETERRED, \"Pete\" Peterson, 89, co-founded The Blackstone Group, a major financial firm, in 1985 after serving in the 1970s as U.S. secretary of commerce. He set up the Peter G. Peterson Foundation to address \"key fiscal challenges threatening Americas future and to accelerate action on them.\", Since 2009, the foundation has given $7.6 million to an anti-deficit group called the Concord Coalition, and $6 million to another group, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. These groups were founded in the 1980s and 1990s to advocate for \"responsible\" fiscal policy. By issuing studies, holding conferences and offering up experts for public appearances, they campaign against deficits and the debt. They help shape a fiscal debate that still flares sometimes. Budget conflict is expected to return to Congress in the coming months when the federal debt ceiling is reached again, with conservative Republicans expected to make demands and perhaps issue shut-down threats around it. The foundation will continue to fund the deficit hawk groups, said Michael, Peters 45-year-old son. \"Theres still an enormous challenge,\" he said. Reuters asked to speak with Peter Peterson, but the foundation responded by offering his son for an interview. The Petersons, who advocate for a balanced budget through increased revenue and spending cuts, say the rising debt burden is a threat to the U.S. standing in the world and to future generations of Americans. DEFICIT CONCERN SLIPS, A Pew Research Center poll this year found that 64 percent of respondents called the deficit a top public policy priority, down eight percentage points since 2013. Resolve over the deficit and the debt has slipped in Congress, too. Earlier this year, lawmakers set aside cuts in Medicare reimbursements for doctors, though the CBO said this would add $141 billion to the U.S. debt in the next decade. With big budget decisions ahead in September and October, advocates of more defense and domestic spending are clamoring to exceed budget caps imposed by a law passed in 2011, when anti-deficit worry was high, under a rule known as the sequester. Steve Bell, senior director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank that also has received money from the Peterson Foundation, complained of \"complacency\" among policymakers on the debt and deficits. \"It is unfortunate that of the nearly two dozen candidates running for president today, virtually none of them have placed a focus on this important issue,\" he said in a statement. Liberal critics say the \"deficit hawks\" lost some credibility a few years ago with apocalyptic warnings that didnt pan out. A decade from now, CBO said, if present laws hold steady, U.S. debt held by the public will equal roughly 77 percent of gross domestic product, a broad measure of the economys size. That would rank the United States roughly 32nd in debt-to-GDP among the nations, with many far more indebted, such as Japan at more than 220 percent. Greece, Italy, Spain, France, Canada and Britain are also more indebted in this way. Robert Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, said his group and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget are refocusing on the national debt and trying to draw attention to it as part of the 2016 presidential campaign. \"The real issue has always been our unsustainable fiscal policy ... it was a problem before the recession and its still a problem,\" Bixby said.

{"Content": "[By Megan Cassella and Alana Wise, (Reuters) - Often maligned for speaking too frankly, Vice President Joe Bidens reputation for shooting from the lip might be one of his biggest weapons if he does decide to run against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Voters in a Reuters/Ipsos survey who said they were open to backing Biden for the nomination described him as an honest and forthright political veteran who is free of scandal despite decades in Washington. Those perceived attributes could give Biden an edge over Clinton, whose \"trustworthy\" poll numbers have dropped as she struggles with perceptions that she has not been completely open about her use of a private email account for official business when she was secretary of state. Clinton says she did nothing wrong and only used the private account because of convenience. The FBI is now investigating the security of the private server and any classified information on it. Reuters spoke to 22 of the poll respondents who said they would support Biden. More than half used words like honest, genuine and trustworthy to describe why they like the former senator. While many opinion polls have been throwing Bidens name into the mix for some months, few have examined the reasons for his relative popularity among many Democrats. His fans appear willing to overlook the 72-year-olds tendency to commit gaffes, which would be a handicap on a presidential campaign. \"He says what he means. Its not always good, but hes upfront and honest,\" said Mary Lampron, 70, of North Providence, Rhode Island. Maybe its not what he should say, but its what he thinks, which I admire, she said. In 2012, Biden surprisedhis boss, President Barack Obama, when he said he was \"absolutely comfortable\" with gay couples getting married, forcing Obama to publicly declare his own support for same sex marriage. QUESTIONS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY, Eleven of the 22 poll respondents interviewed mentioned what they saw as Clintons lack of transparency, or controversy surrounding her, as a mark against her candidacy. According to Quinnipiac polls, 64 percent of voters surveyed in August said Clinton is not honest and trustworthy  up from 54 percent in April. \"I dont support her because her credibilitys been in question. Thats the main issue. I dont trust her,\" said Icie Farnsworth, 53, a lifelong Democrat from Martinsville, Virginia, who said she liked Bidens voting record on the economy, civil rights and education. Last month Clinton blamed a \"constant barrage of attacks that are largely fomented by and coming from the right.\" \"People should and do trust me,\" she told CNN in an interview. Biden has not said whether he will run for president, but speculation grew at the weekend that he may soon challenge Clinton for the Democratic nomination when he met with Senator Elizabeth Warren, a power broker among liberals. It is late in the nomination contest and Biden is still way behind both Clinton and liberal Senator Bernie Sanders. Only 13.3 percent of 690 Democrats in the Reuters/Ipsos online survey backed Biden while 47 percent supported Clinton and 24.9 percent were for Sanders, who has been attracting much larger crowds than Clinton. All the same, the fact that Biden might be considering a run compounds Clintons headaches. \"At a minimum, he definitely shakes the race up and makes Hillarys path to the nomination arguably more difficult,\" said Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis, who is not working for any of the campaigns. \"People like him, people want to like him, hes charismatic, and hes got a very powerful personal story to say the least,\" Kofinis said. Several people interviewed referred to Bidens son Beau, 46, who died of brain cancer in May. His death was another tragic chapter in the life of the vice president, who lost his first wife and his daughter in a car accident shortly after winning election to the U.S. Senate in 1972. Though Clinton has wide policy experience, Bidens 36 years in the Senate and almost two terms as vice president count in his favor among supporters. \"I know she was first lady and has experience in the White House in that capacity, and I know she was secretary of state, but I think the experience he has is closer to what is needed for the presidency,\" said Dee Garletts, 72, of Bellevue, Washington. Ruby Ellis, 74, of Lawrence, Kansas said she liked Biden because he was untainted by scandal. \"He would just be a real refreshing person without problems behind him of any kind,\" she said.

{"Content": "[WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Real estate mogul Donald Trump is dominating polls and capturing headlines in the Republican presidential race, but rival Jeb Bush is still the favorite of traders in political prediction markets. While Bush has been eclipsed by Trump in opinion polls, the former Florida governor is riding high with online traders who give him a 40 percent chance to capture the partys presidential nomination, according to prediction market aggregator PredictWise.com. Florida Senator Marco Rubio is a distant second with a 15 percent chance, and Trump has risen to third in recent weeks with 14 percent, according to PredictWise, which aggregates about a half-dozen political prediction markets. Those markets, in which traders bet on the outcomes of various events, often have a better track record than polls in determining a winner in elections. Bush has been their favorite since mid-2014, said David Rothschild, an economist who runs PredictWise. \"Jeb Bush has been steady at the top at between 45 percent and 40 percent, where he is now. He certainly hasnt fallen off noticeably,\" Rothschild said. In opinion polls, Trump has shot past Bush in recent weeks as the two candidates have feuded over Trumps hard-line immigration plan calling for deportation of illegal immigrants. In the Real Clear Politics average of polls, Bush runs second in the 17-strong Republican field at 11 percent behind Trumps 22 percent. A Reuters/Ipsos poll on Tuesday showed Bush tumbling into a tie for third behind Trump, as Bushs support fell from 16 percent to 8 percent over five days. At Irish bookmaker Paddy Power, Bush remains the favorite with 13/8 odds of capturing the Republican nomination for the November 2016 election, said spokesman Rory Scott. \"Jeb Bush has drifted a tiny little bit, probably because of the rise of Trump, but hes still the favorite and hes been pretty stable,\" Scott said. Trump has been on the move, however, attracting about 50 percent of the bets since the first debate earlier this month and rising to second, Scott said. For the Democrats, front-runner Hillary Clinton has been a steady and dominating force at the top of the presidential pack in the markets since immediately after the 2012 election. She currently is given a 72 percent chance of winning the nomination by PredictWise, with Vice President Joe Biden, who is still pondering a possible bid, in second at 14 percent.

{"Content": "[WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - At almost every turn lately, Donald Trump has tried to get under Jeb Bushs skin. In interviews and on social media, Trump relentlessly needles and mocks Bush, almost to the exclusion of his many other rivals in the Republican presidential field. Ronald Reagan used to refer to what he called the 11th Commandment - Thou shalt not speak ill of any Republican. But as he has done often during this campaign season, Trump is playing by his own set of rules. Trumps incivility is unusually raw and personal for any modern presidential campaign, particularly at this early stage, when most of the contenders are busy blasting Democrats, not each other. And unlike candidates in the past, Trump doesnt use proxies or surrogates. It comes straight from him. But theres a method to Trumps Bush-bashing, those close to Trump tell Reuters. The jabs at Bush elevate Trump in the eyes of his supporters, who view Bush as the product of an establishment it disdains. And they work to reinforce the idea that Bush, who with his massive financial war chest could yet prove to be Trumps biggest rival, is struggling with voters. Trump looks to be playing the schoolyard bully in order to show that Jeb Bush is too weak with his counter-attacks to really be a threat, said Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist. Theres little political downside to Trumps brickbats. His campaign isnt worried that alienating Bush supporters could cost him votes somewhere down the line. \"Any vote Trump knocks off of Bush isnt going to go Trump,\" said Roger Stone, a former top adviser to the real estate moguls campaign. Recent polling from Reuters/IPSOS show that Trumps needling could be having an effect. Support for Bush - who many saw as an early favorite for the Republican nomination - has bottomed out among Republican voters over the past week. At just 8 percent, he now trails Trump by more than 20 percentage points. TAUNTING VIA TWEETS, Over the past week, Trump stepped up his taunts of Bush on social media and in interviews. The last thing we need is another Bush in the White House, Trump recently tweeted. In another tweet, Trump said, Jeb Bush never uses his last name on advertising, signage, materials etc. Is he ashamed of the name BUSH? A pretty sad situation. On Instagram, Trump even went as far as posting a video of Barbara Bush, Bushs mother and the former first lady, telling an interviewer last year that she didnt think Jeb Bush should run for president. Trump was back at it at a campaign rally in Greenville, South Carolina, on Thursday. \"I used to think he was a guy that you had to beat,\" Trump said of Bush. \"But hes going down fast.\", Trump has taken to calling Bush a low-energy person in interviews. His campaign delighted last week when cable news outlets contrasted Trumps raucous event in New Hampshire with a more somnolent affair Bush was holding in the same state - which will hold one of the nations first nominating contests in February, ahead of the November 2016 presidential election. Bushs campaign dismissed Trumps attacks. I think Trump is trying to overcompensate for the fact that Jeb was a successful pro-life, tax-cutting, small-government conservative governor, while he was a liberal New York socialite advocating for partial birth abortion, the biggest tax increase in American history and socialized health care, said Tim Miller, a spokesman for the Bush campaign. Even so, Bush seems to be taking notice of Trumps effrontery. His trip to the U.S. southwest border this week was viewed as a response to Trumps divisive immigration policy. Bush argued that mass deportations of illegal immigrants, something that Trump has called for, is not the answer. But Bush found himself on the defensive when he tried to clarify his use of the term anchor babies - typically used to describe U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. He ended up saying that he was largely referring to Asian women who come to the United States in organized efforts to give birth in order to secure U.S. citizenship for their children. Trump reveled in Bushs struggles. Asians are very offended that Jeb said anchor babies applies to them as a way to be more politically correct to Hispanics, Trump tweeted. A mess!, On Wednesday, Bush fired back at Trump while at a rally in Pensacola, Florida. Do we have to talk about this guy? Bush said, rolling his eyes and smirking. Vin Weber, a former Republican congressman who is backing Bush, said he was glad that Bush hasnt been drawn into a war of insults with Trump. I like what Bush did on the border, Weber said. He didnt call him names, but he dissected his immigration policy pretty well. Thats got to be the approach. ITS PERSONAL, Trump tries to connect Bush to his family history as often as he can, in an effort to appeal to voters wary of dynastic politics. In interviews, hes recently brought up both George H.W. Bushs \"no new taxes\" pledge and the Iraq War launched under George W. Bush. He sees Bush as his main rival, even if the polls may not reflect that right now, said Bruce Buchanan, an expert on presidential politics at the University of Texas. While Bush is at a low ebb, Buchanan said, Trump is seeing if he cant take some wind out of his sails. Bush supporters see it that way, too. Its pretty clear that the race is becoming Bush versus Trump, said Tre Evers, a Bush fundraiser in Orlando. The people that I deal with really do not view Donald Trump - nobody that Ive talked to thinks he will get the nomination or be elected president, Evers added. The dismissive attitude toward Trump by some who insist he will never be the Republican nominee is what inflames Trumps supporters, who view Bush as the epitome of the big-money Republican establishment. Earlier this month in Iowa, Trump called Bush a puppet to his donors. But even with Bush in a weakened state, Trump knows his campaign remains potent. Bush has raised more money - a record-setting $120 million - than any candidate in the field, Republican or Democrat. Trumps advisers recall Mitt Romneys super PAC bombarding Romneys primary opponents with ads during the 2012 election. \"When I look at Jeb raising hundreds of millions of dollars, hell do attack ads on me,\" Trump said Thursday in South Carolina. Theres another, more basic, reason for Trumps continued antagonism toward Bush, said Stone, the former Trump adviser. \"I think Donald perceives an attitude that Jeb just believes he should be anointed. That its his by birthright,\" Stone said. \"I dont think he likes Jeb.\", , , (Reporting by James Oliphant and Emily Flitter; Additional reporting by Grant Smith in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler)]", "Date": "20150828", "Title": "[Politics as blood sport: Trump looks to kick Bush when he's down]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150827_Reuters_Report_KCN0QW2LM_Politics_as_blood_sport__Trump_looks_to_kick_Bush_when_he_s_down.html\n", "Author": "[James Oliphant and Emily Flitter, Reuters]"}
{"Content": "[NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Manhattan real estate lawyer Jon Mechanic remembers the summer day a decade ago when Donald Trump gave him a tour of a vacant retail space inside the Trump Tower on a glittering stretch of Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. Mechanic was representing Gucci, and the luxury retailer was already sold on opening a flagship store in what was unquestionably a prime location. But the salesman in Trump still couldnt resist pumping it up in his sales pitch. \"He said it was the best retail space, in the best retail building, on the best corner, in the best city in the world,\" Mechanic recalled. Mechanic still has a copy of Trumps book, \"The Art of the Deal,\" which the billionaire inscribed during the visit: \"To the greatest real estate lawyer in the world, best wishes, Donald.\", Anyone who has witnessed Trumps meteoric surge to the top of the 2016 Republican presidential field is familiar with that style of Trump Talk - a mix of bullish optimism and hyperbole. It may in part explain his rise in the polls. While his competitors gravely list the countrys ills, Trump tells voters how fantastic everything is going to be once hes president. He has pledged to be \"the greatest jobs president God ever created,\" to be \"better on womens health issues\" than Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, to seize Irans oil reserves, to beat up on China while making \"them like us,\" to force Mexico to pay for a new 2,000-mile (3,219 km) wall along its border with the United States, and to round up and deport 11 million undocumented immigrants. But campaigning for the White House is different than hawking commercial real estate. Trumps penchant for exaggeration could backfire - he risks promising voters more than he can deliver. Trump himself has recognized this risk, calling out in \"The Art of the Deal\" former presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan for overpromising. More recently, this week on Twitter, Trump referenced former President George H.W. Bushs infamous \"Read my lips: no new taxes\" pledge. In a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Trump indicated he understood he would have to tone things down over the long haul of the presidential campaign, saying he would have to be a \"little more selective\" in the things he says. Nevertheless, Trumps over-the-top style has its admirers. For Vincent DeVito, a lawyer who has worked on Republican presidential campaigns, Trumps campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again,\" says it all. DeVito said Trump was trying to address a feeling of malaise in the country. He dismissed the idea that the billionaire was overhyping his abilities. Those trying to gauge how Trumps hyperbole could help or hurt his chances of winning the White House could look at his business record.  Trumps lawyer Michael Cohen said Trumps record of success was \"proof positive of Mr. Trumps character and capabilities.\", , TRUTHFUL HYPERBOLE, Optimistic exaggeration, which Trump called \"truthful hyperbole\" in \"The Art of the Deal,\" is a hallmark of the cutthroat New York real estate world where many developers, accustomed to ramming their way into deals, puff up their portfolios. \"A little hyperbole never hurts,\" he wrote. \"People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular ... Its an innocent form of exaggeration - and a very effective form of promotion.\", For Trump, exaggerating has always been a frequent impulse, especially when the value of his Trump brand is disputed. In some instances, braggadocio has served him well, in other cases it has backfired. In the early 1990s, when a recession swept away large portions of his New York real estate empire, Trump fought with creditors and their lawyers to hold on to his interest in properties like the Plaza Hotel, financed by loans hed had to personally guarantee. In one boardroom packed with bankers and lawyers, according to three people familiar with the scene, Trump tried to argue that his name - which was attached to several buildings that lenders were threatening to possess - was worth more than they were acknowledging. Many multiples, he said. A lawyer for one of the creditors shot back: The cash flow estimates on the properties were demonstrably negative. So, many multiples of a negative number would make a larger negative number, the three sources recounted. Ultimately, Trumps creditors eventually decided not to repossess some of his properties because they werent worth the costs associated with the repossession, one of the sources said. \"Every successful individual throughout history has had at one point in their lives a downturn,\" Trumps lawyer Cohen said. \"Mr. Trumps was the result of a down market in real estate during the 1990s. The true test of a mans capability is how he deals with that adversity and where he is today.\", Since the 1990s, some investors in Trump projects have complained the developer overpromised investors on their potential returns. Investors who bought junk bonds to help finance the Trump Castle casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, filed a class action suit accusing Trump and his company of misrepresenting its financial health when the value of the bonds plummeted. Trump denied any liability, arguing that the investors were fully informed of the risk involved. The suit later settled for an undisclosed sum. More recently, pending suits by condo owners in the Trump Toronto Hotel and retirees who spent thousands to attend courses offered by the now-defunct Trump University accuse Trump and his business partners of promising far more than they can deliver. In the case of the Toronto property, investors in condos complained they were given overly optimistic projections of what they could earn and were not informed that they would have to pay commercial taxes on the property. Trump University customers said in a suit they were promised appearances and instruction by Trump but encountered only a cardboard cutout of the real estate mogul during weekend sessions on business success in a hotel ballroom. In both cases, Reuters obtained and reviewed copies of the lawsuits and subsequent court filings. Trump and his lawyers have said the pending suit over Trump University is baseless. His lawyer Alan Garten called it \"totally lacking in any merit.\" [ID: nL1N1031T2], A judge dismissed Trump from liability in the Toronto suit, saying it was his Canadian partners who had overestimated potential earnings on the property and that Trump had merely licensed his name, but lawyers for the plaintiffs say they plan to reintroduce the claim in an appeal. PRESIDENTIAL SETUP, Washington of course is no stranger to hyperbole. President Barack Obama was criticized for telling voters they would be able to keep their insurance plans intact under his healthcare overhaul, Obamacare, when in fact they couldnt. And Republicans in the House and Senate have yet to fulfill their promise to swiftly repeal the very same healthcare legislation once they took control of Congress, which they did in the 2014 midterm elections. Anger over those failures is partly whats driving Republican voters toward Trump: In surveys, many respondents say they no longer trust elected officials. But Trumps sweeping pledges could also be setting him up for a fall. Trump may be promising too much, said Michael Wissot, a Republican strategist and lecturer at the University of Southern California. \"Convincing Mexico to pay for a fence along our border is unrealistic,\" he said. \"Deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants is a logistical nightmare. These are examples of putting himself in a very precarious position even if he were successful,\" he said. Recently Trump has been talking up his similarities to Reagan. Both were once Democrats. More important, both spent years in front of the camera, honing their images. But almost 30 years ago, Trump viewed Reagan with a more jaundiced eye. \"He is so smooth and so effective a performer that he completely won over the American people,\" Trump wrote of Reagan in \"The Art of the Deal.\" \"Only now, nearly seven years later, are people beginning to question whether theres anything behind that smile.\", , (This version of the story corrects spelling of Jon Mechanics first name in paragraph one), , (Reporting By Emily Flitter and James Oliphant; Additional reporting by Alastair Sharp in Toronto, editing by Ross Colvin)]", "Date": "20150828", "Title": "[Best president ever!

Texas is one of only two U.S. states, the other being Hawaii, that were once internationally recognized sovereign nations, with diplomatic ties to other countries. Although legal experts said it would be unconstitutional for Texas to break away via a primary vote, there is still a spirit of Texas independence among many in the Lone Star State. \"What we are seeing, over and over, is this complete disconnect between the people of Texas, what they want, and what is going on in Washington, D.C.,\" TNM President Daniel Miller told Reuters. \"The people of Texas dont have anything against the United States, they are just tired of being governed by bureaucrats we didnt elect pushing programs we dont want.\", He compared Texas to Scotland, which narrowly defeated a proposal to secede from the United Kingdom last year, and Catalonia, which is pushing to hold a vote on independence from Spain this year. \"We are living in the era of the right of political self-determination,\" Miller said. But there is one rather big problem, according to T. Gerald Treece, a professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston and an expert on Constitutional Law. \"That problem is the Civil War,\" Treece said. \"When Texas and the other Southern states were re-admitted, each of them made a solemn promise that they would never leave the Union again.\", Treece said there are some legislative options available to the Texas Nationalist Movement, short of another civil war. \"You have to have the Texas Legislature initiate a request, and then you have to have the U.S. Congress approve it, and then it could happen,\" he said, adding that with two sovereigns involved, both would have to give their assent. Many states have discussed leaving the Union over the last century, but the talk has been louder in Texas, with some Republicans, including former Governor Rick Perry, floating the idea of secession. Texas would certainly have the clout to become influential on the world stage as an independent nation, with a $1.4 trillion-a year-economy, about the same size as South Koreas.

At a news conference in his own Trump Tower in Manhattan,the property magnate waved the loyalty pledge, signed in a thickblack marker, in the air for TV cameras. \"I see no circumstances under which I would tear up thatpledge,\" he said. Trump had previously refused to rule out a third-party bid,drawing boos from the crowd in Ohio last month at the first fullRepublican debate.

{"Content": "[Sept 3 (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidates were split over whether a county clerk in Kentucky, who was jailed on Thursday, should be forced to issue same-sex marriage licenses despite her religious objections. The U.S. Supreme Courts ruling in June that gay couples have a constitutional right to marry upset many conservatives, who believe marriage should be restricted to heterosexual couples. Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis became a cultural flashpoint for refusing to issue marriage licenses after the ruling, citing her faith. On Thursday, a federal judge held Davis in contempt of court and sent her to jail. Her case has caused a rift among the cadre of candidates seeking the Republican nomination in the November 2016 election, a split that shows a difficult path to attract religious conservatives and other wings of the party that are less focused on social issues. Several of the 17 Republican presidential hopefuls said on Thursday that Davis should not have been punished. \"I think its absurd to put someone in jail for exercising their religious liberty,\" U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky told CNN on Thursday. \"I think this is a real mistake.\", Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, said on Twitter he would travel to Kentucky to support Davis.

{"Content": "[By Susan Heavey, WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leading Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump showed again on Friday he will not easily be bound to party orthodoxy, breaking from many of his rivals policy stances on issues from the Iran nuclear deal to the gay marriage fight in Kentucky.    , In an interview with MSNBC, one day after signing the partys loyalty pledge to not run as an independent, Trump said he would work with the Obama administrations nuclear agreement with Iran, nevertheless calling it \"a disastrous deal\" and \"a horrible contract.\", Many of the 16 other Republicans seeking the partys nomination for the 2016 presidential election have vowed to undo the agreement. But Trump, a wealthy businessman, reiterated his view that too much money was at stake and his rivals were wrong to say they would rip it up. \"I love to buy bad contracts where key people go bust, and I make those contracts good,\" he said, adding that he would strictly enforce the Iran deal. Trump took a different tack on the Kentucky battle over gay marriage. Some Republicans loudly backed Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis, who opted for jail time rather than issue any marriage licenses after the U.S. Supreme Courts June ruling in support of gay marriage, which goes against her religious beliefs.  , \"We are a nation of laws,\" Trump said. \"You have to go with it. The decisions been made, and thats the law of the land.\" , Davis could authorize her deputies to sign the paperwork instead, he said. Her office began issuing licenses on Friday. Public opinion polls show Trump leading rivals by double-digits. \"Im not taking anything for granted,\" he told MSNBCs \"Morning Joe\" program, acknowledging the wide Republican field. \"I understand ... it is a marathon.\", On the European refugee crisis, Trump said while the United States had its own border and immigration problems, the situation was \"horrible.\" Few Republican presidential candidates have spoken out on the crisis, and even the White House has acknowledged it without announcing any action. The leading Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, also on Friday called for United States and other nations to act. Asked whether the United States should accept more refugees fleeing violence in the Middle East, Trump said: \"Possibly yes\" but noted limited U.S. options to help. On that point, he and other Republicans agree. \"We have our own problems; we have so many problems to solve,\" he said. \"Our country is broken.\", ,  (Reporting by Susan Heavey; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Diane Craft)]", "Date": "20150904", "Title": "[Trump, after Republican pledge, breaks from pack on Iran, gay marriage]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150904_Reuters_Report_KCN0R41HN_Trump__after_Republican_pledge__breaks_from_pack_on_Iran__gay_marriage.html\n", "Author": "[Susan Heavey, Reuters]"}

{"Content": "[By Steve Holland, PITTSBURGH (Reuters) - Vice President Joe Biden on Monday gave a glimpse of what a Biden race for the Democratic presidential nomination would look like should he decide to make a late entry into the race after a highly public period of soul-searching. In a speech and walkabout at a rally in downtown Pittsburgh, Biden marked Labor Day with a full-throated appeal for steps to fix income inequality and gave a picture of the personal touch he would offer on the campaign trail. Biden, 72, looked energetic and eager. He jogged back and forth across a downtown Pittsburgh street to greet people who met him with cheers of \"Run Joe Run.\", He seemed to be genuinely enjoying himself as he snapped selfie photos and waded into the crowd to shake hands. Biden is conflicted about entering a Democratic race for the November 2016 election dominated thus far by Hillary Clinton, the partys favorite, and self-described socialist Bernie Sanders. Speaking to members of the United Steelworkers as he ended his Pittsburgh visit, Biden praised Sanders as \"doing a hell of a job.\" When a worker shouted \"Biden for president,\" Biden dodged the issue. \"No... Youve got to talk to my wife about that. Ive got to talk to my wife about that,\" he said. Biden said last week he is not sure he has the emotional energy for a candidacy following the death of his son Beau in May from cancer. He has given himself variously until later this month and possibly as long as until November to act on an appeal earlier this year from Beau to run for president. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who accompanied Biden in walking the parade route, said he did not know if Biden would run, but added:, \"If youre looking for energy, this is a great place to get energy today.\", An eye-opener for Biden boosters was a fresh NBC News/Marist poll over the weekend that showed Biden gaining strength in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire race in spite of not being a candidate. In introducing Biden for his speech, Trumka and United Steelworkers union chief Leo Gerard gave strong praise to Biden, who was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania. \"He has never let us down,\" said Gerard. Biden, in his rally speech, said the tax code is to blame for the rich getting a bigger piece of the economic pie. \"It used to be when productivity went up in America, everybody got a chance to share,\" said Biden. \"They got a piece of the action...

{"Content": "[LACONIA, N.H. (AP) - Jeb Bush wanted to run for president as a joyful front-runner, above the fray of the pack. Instead, he heads into the fall campaign as a fighter with a foil: Donald Trump. Theres a new urgency in Bushs tone as a candidate. Its moved from frustration and annoyance with Trumps constant needling to a willingness to confront the brash billionaire and call him out for his antics. And though he still relies on the policy-driven arguments that suit his wonkish style, the son and brother of former presidents is also acknowledging whats powered Trumps rise: outrage with the political class his family embodies. Such anger alone, he says, cannot prevail. \"I believe that a conservative can win, campaigning with his arms wide open, with joy in his heart, speaking about the hopes and aspirations of the people, being on the side of the people that right now dont see their lives in the future being better than what they have today,\" Bush told a crowded hall in New Hampshire late last week. Bushs aides argue there was no \"aha!\" moment for the former Florida governor that triggered a shift in strategy. Instead, they say, the threat posed by Trump - who has held steady atop polls nationally and in the early voting states for the past six weeks - has awakened an instinctive sense of drive. \"Its something about Jebs makeup,\" said spokesman Tim Miller. \"He is an extremely competitive person, in all aspects of life. He recognizes that this is a race he has to earn.\", Bush remains viewed by many in the party - as well among his opponents - as the most likely candidate to emerge from the unwieldy GOP field to win the nomination. Thats due in large part to the more than $114 million Bush has raised for his campaign and allied super PAC - far and away the most of any 2016 White House effort - and the television advertising that money buys. The super PAC is scheduled to begin $21.8 million in advertising in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina this month. \"Hes still the front-runner, though others could compete\" said veteran GOP presidential adviser Charlie Black, who isnt aligned with any 2016 candidate. He predicted the ads will change public opinion. Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton often mentions Bush by name, although she has taken to talking about Trump more often in recent weeks. In doing so, shes tried to link Bush to Trumps policies on immigration - an issue on which the two men have vastly different ideas. And while Trump is an equal opportunity belittler, fighting back against anyone he deems \"not nice,\" he, too, focuses more often than not on Bush. \"As far as Jeb is concerned,\" Trump said, \"I watched him this morning on television and its a little bit sad. Dont forget, he was supposed to win. And he just doesnt have the energy.\" He made the comment on a day when he pledged to remain a Republican. Bush displayed plenty of energy during his run through New Hampshire last week. More than 200 voters got a taste of the new approach, and some uncharacteristically blunt language, after a woman asked Bush during a campaign stop in the states northern lake community if hes afraid that contrasting himself with Trump will turn off voters. \"Im going to push back when he says things that are ugly,\" Bush replied. \"I sure as hell am going to, when he attacks me personally or disparages my family. Damn right, Im going to fight back.\", But, he added to whoops and cheers, \"Im not going to participate in some reality TV show.\" During the same trip, after Trump suggested Bush should only speak English while in the U.S. the bilingual candidate defiantly told factory workers the GOP should campaign with \"brazos abiertos\" - or open arms. While Bush engaged with Trump in a contest of snarky Instagram videos last week, he also tried to short-circuit Trumps appeal by joining in bemoaning the failures of those in power. Referring to a Colorado veterans hospital project that has ballooned in cost, Bush said, \"no one accepts responsibility,\" his voice rising as he jabbed a finger into the air punctuating his words. \"Fix the damn thing. Thats what people want.\", While some supporters are sold on Bushs grittier approach, others are eager to see how it plays out in the months ahead. \"Theres no worry, yet,\" said Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois. \"It might be a little different if we get too late into the fall and things havent changed.\", Bush voiced confidence they will. \"Maybe were in the first quarter,\" Bush said, making a football reference. \"Theres a long haul to go.\", ___, Associated Press reporters Lisa Lerer in Washington and Serio Bustos in Pensacola, Florida, contributed to this report. ___, Follow Thomas Beaumont on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/tombeaumont]", "Date": "20150908", "Title": "[Trump surge challenges Bush to fight, yet keep the 'joy']", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150908_ap_dbe030cbcdcf429cb4fd094444ecca76.html\n", "Author": "[THOMAS BEAUMONT, The Associated Press]"}

{"Content": "[GETTYSBURG, Pa. (AP) - The Pennsylvania Democratic State Committee elected Marcel Groen as its chairman on Saturday, ending months of uncertainty that fractured the state partys leadership. Groen, a lawyer who has headed the Montgomery County Democratic Committee for more than two decades, was unopposed in his bid to serve as the partys leader for the nearly three years left in the second term of former chairman Jim Burn. Burn resigned Saturday prior to the state committee vote, fulfilling a promise he made in July to step down in the interest of party unity. \"I see this as the best solution ... to get the focus back on the candidates and the Democrats,\" rather than on internal disputes, Burn said Friday. Burn, who is from western Pennsylvania, was first elected chairman in 2010. He refused to step aside last year after Wolf won a four-way Democratic primary with 58 percent of the vote and tried to replace him with Katie McGinty, who finished last in the primary. The state committee granted Burn a second term and Wolf formed his own political committee, the Campaign for a Fresh Start, and put McGinty in charge. She later served as the governors chief of staff and is now a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate. Wolfs spokesman on Friday declined to discuss the leadership change, which could provide smoother sailing for the Democrats at a critical time. This years election battle for control of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court could assure Democrats a majority on the states highest court for more than a decade if they win all three open seats. The crucial 2016 election will bring the Democratic National Convention to Philadelphia and decide slew of national and state races: the presidency, the U.S. Senate and House, the three state row offices and the state Legislature. \"Theyre all important,\" said Groen, 70, who will serve as chairman through at least June 2018. Groen, who has been active in Democratic politics since 1971, said he wants to involve more rank-and-file party members in the candidate endorsement process and encourage potential rising stars. Groen, a partner in the Fox Rothschild law firm, is the son of Holocaust survivors from Amsterdam who emigrated to the United States with his family when he was 9. \"When I got off the boat, I spoke no English,\" he said Friday.]", "Date": "20150912", "Title": "[Pennsylvania Democrats elect Groen as new state chairman]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150912_ap_d3186ac1b8ba4ff985a24e8573454cde.html\n", "Author": "[ The Associated Press]"}
{"Content": "[KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa. (AP) - Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey is preparing to face what could be his biggest political test yet as he runs for another term in 2016, a presidential election year, when Democrats tend to have more success getting elected in the primarily Democratic state. Toomeys announcement Sunday at a suburban Philadelphia hotel that he is running for a second term was a formality. His campaign has been up and running for months, raising millions of dollars and airing a TV ad to tout his work on legislation to make it more difficult for would-be child predators to get jobs in schools. The event, with endorsements from people in law enforcement, business and child protection advocacy, gave a look at how Toomey will characterize his four and a half years in office. As a campaign video played at the event put it, Toomey is \"getting things done for Pennsylvania\" and often working with Democrats to do it. Toomey told a crowd of more than 100 people in the hotel ballroom about his experience in the Senate, saying hes learned its difficult to get things done in Washington partly because of a polarized political environment. \"Its a challenging environment for all of us,\" he said. \"But Ive learned that it is possible to get things done if youre willing to stick to your principles but look for common ground at the same time.\", Accomplishments, according to the campaign, include working with Democrats on a package of 2012 legislation that relaxed regulations on small- and medium-size businesses to help them raise capital and grow. Toomey, 53, is popular with business, anti-tax and free-market advocacy groups. Hes framing his fiscal conservatism as a populist and bipartisan fight against wasteful spending of tax dollars and corporate welfare. That will compete with the Democrats version of a fiscal conservative who has opposed their efforts to increase the federal minimum wage and backed Republican plans in Congress to halt federal dollars for Planned Parenthood and overhaul traditional Medicare coverage into a subsidy-based health insurance option on the open market. The American Conservative Union gives Toomey a lifetime 94 rating through 2014, ranking him the second-most conservative Pennsylvania member of Congress in office last year, after U.S. Rep. Joe Pitts. After Toomeys 20-minute speech, he downplayed the notion that 2016 will be markedly more difficult for him than 2010. In 2010, Toomey narrowly won his first term, beating Democratic former U.S. Rep. Joe Sestak by 2 percentage points, when a midterm Republican wave helped the GOP pick up 69 seats in Congress. \"This is Pennsylvania, so I assume this is going to be a very competitive race,\" Toomey said. \"But we will be prepared for it. We will run strong, and Im confident were going to win.\", In a presidential election year, more registered voters turn out at the polls, and Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 4-3 ratio in Pennsylvania. Democrats believe the higher voter turnout means a better shot at winning for their candidates. The state has supported Democratic candidates for president in six straight elections. Toomey, who lives in the Allentown area, is unopposed for the Republican nomination and has a unified party behind him. A Quinnipiac University poll in June showed him leading Sestak, 47 percent to 36 percent. Including Sestak, Democrats have a field of at least three challengers seeking the partys nomination in the April 26 primary election. Sestak, a former Navy vice admiral, declared in March that he would seek a rematch with Toomey. Katie McGinty, who has held high-level posts in state and federal government, joined the hunt in August. Braddock Mayor John Fetterman said Friday that he will run. Before joining the Senate, the Harvard University-educated Toomey helped start a restaurant chain, worked in investment banking and headed the Washington, D.C.-based Club for Growth, which advocates for free markets, less government regulation and lower taxes. He also served three terms in the U.S. House, representing the Allentown area, and ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate in 2004, losing narrowly in the GOP primary to the late Arlen Specter.]", "Date": "20150913", "Title": "[Toomey's 1st re-election bid could be his biggest test yet]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150913_ap_76366c3b140743d7b782f31f253832e4.html\n", "Author": "[MARC LEVY, The Associated Press]"}

{"Content": "[MADISON, Wis. (AP) - Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker is hoping to pull his campaign off the mat by taking on unions - a familiar foe for the Wisconsin governor - in a sweeping plan to upend pillars of organized labor nationwide. Walkers plan calls for eliminating unions for employees of the federal government, making all workplaces right-to-work unless individual states vote otherwise and scrapping the federal agency that oversees unfair labor practices. Union leaders are livid. Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union that represents 150,000 federal workers, said Walker is \"declaring a war on middle-class workers.\" And Democratic presidential contender Hillary Rodham Clinton accused him of bullying union members. One of Walkers Republican rivals challenged the plan, too, saying it is the wrong message for the GOP to send to unionized workers. \"Instead of treating all union members like they are the enemy,\" said former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, \"its time we invite them to give some of us in our party a try.\", In an interview with The Associated Press on Monday, Walker said no one should be surprised. \"I think people would be shocked if the governor who took on big government special interests wouldnt do it at the federal level,\" Walker said by telephone as he waited to board a plane to Nevada. In his speech spelling out his \"Power to the People\" proposal at a Las Vegas manufacturer, Walker said he didnt back down against union protesters in Wisconsin and he was ready for the national fight. \"Collective bargaining is not a right, it is an expensive entitlement,\" he said, speaking with his sleeves rolled up, in between a pair of oversized construction vehicles and in front of a large American flag. Bob Denoto, a 53-year-old electrician and union recruiter, was in Las Vegas from New York for a union conference and decided to stop by Walkers event.  He didnt like what he heard. \"I know what the union has given me and my family,\" he said. \"Some day, when Im old and broken down, Im going to be able to retire without government assistance.\", Walkers move comes as he tries to gain traction heading into the second GOP presidential debate, being held Wednesday in California. A weak performance in the first debate and a series of missteps has contributed to his tumble from the polls after his strong start months ago. \"I think its a good move,\" said Richard Schwarm, a former GOP chairman in the early caucus state of Iowa who is uncommitted in the 2016 race. \"It gets a lot of attention on him in the next day or two.\", Walker won nationwide recognition for eviscerating public-sector unions in Wisconsin and becoming the first governor to prevail in a recall election, which followed huge protests against his anti-union steps. Now hes proposing to go national with an effort to curb union clout. \"Its reminding people of the reason they liked us in the first place,\" Walker said in the interview, brushing aside with laughter a question about whether the move was a sign of desperation. The reaction from labor groups and Democrats, their traditional political ally, was fierce. \"Scott Walker can now add one-trick pony to his resume, right underneath national disgrace,\" said AFL-CIO spokesman Eric Hauser. \"His campaign is floundering and so he does what he always does when he cant think of real solutions. He attacks workers.\", J. David Cox, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union of federal workers, representing about 750,000 people, said its a last-ditch effort by a failing candidate. \"It appears to me that Scott Walker is pretty much desperate in his campaign right now as hes sinking to the bottom of the polls,\" Cox said. \"This is desperate action on the part of a very desperate candidate.\", Clinton said on Twitter that unions make families strong. \"Scott Walkers attacks on unions and workers rights arent leadership - theyre bullying,\" she said. Her main Democratic rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, said Walkers plan would only make rich people and corporations even wealthier. \"If we are going to rebuild the crumbling middle class we need a stronger trade-union movement, not a weaker one,\" he said in a statement. Labor law experts were taken aback by the scope of Walkers proposal, which seeks to undo decades of law and would gut the landmark National Labor Relations Act - adopted in 1935 and signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the height of the Great Depression. \"Ive never seen anything like this,\" said Ann Hodges, a professor at the University of Richmond who has studied labor law for more than 40 years. \"This will take the breath away from anyone whos worked in labor relations for any length of time. ... Its pretty draconian.\", Walkers plan also calls for prohibiting the automatic withdrawal of union dues to be used for political purposes and forbidding union organizers from accessing employees personal information, such as their phone numbers. While Walker could enact some of the proposals via presidential executive order, the most far-reaching ones would require an act of Congress, a major barrier by any measure. ___, Associated Press writer Kimberly Pierceall contributed to this report from Las Vegas. ___, Follow Scott Bauer on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/sbauerAP]", "Date": "20150914", "Title": "[Fierce response to Walker plan to bar federal public unions]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150914_ap_9608f343fcae476db6fbe89238b2f3c7.html\n", "Author": "[SCOTT BAUER, The Associated Press]"}

{"Content": "[WASHINGTON (AP) - Republican presidential candidates not named Donald Trump have raised hundreds of millions of dollars for their campaigns and allied groups. Yet none of that money is being targeted against the celebrity real estate mogul, the partys front-runner through the summer. Now the first well-funded anti-Trump volley is coming, though not from another candidate. Its from the Club for Growth, a Washington-based tax-cutting advocacy group that just months ago asked Trump for a contribution. The group said Tuesday it will spend $1 million assailing Trump on TV in the early caucus state of Iowa. Its 30-second commercials, which begin Thursday, call him \"the worst kind of politician,\" highlight some of his most liberal positions and say hes playing voters \"for chumps.\", Trump would seem a ripe target for any conservative organization: Hes said in the past that he identifies \"more as a Democrat.\", For now, though, Club for Growth is going it alone. Some of the largest pro-Republican political groups - including the Koch brothers-led Americans for Prosperity, GOP strategist Karl Roves Crossroads groups and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce - say they have no immediate plans to swat at him. Fred Malek, a longtime Republican presidential fundraiser who isnt aligned with a specific candidate, said the approach of many has been to \"let Trump beat Trump.\", \"Im not aware of any organized effort to attack Trump,\" Malek said. \"Rather, the best-informed Republicans feel the American people are smart enough to figure this out and wont nominate Trump.\", Similarly, the candidates themselves, and the super PACs trying to help them win, havent put any money into a Trump-defeating effort on television. Instead, their strategy appears to be to wait for the star of the political summer to fade on his own. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who last week became the first candidate to leave the 2016 race, was one of the feistiest Trump combatants, but his super PACs never paid for any ads to amplify that message. \"Our plan, which I think is where a lot of folks are, was to wait as long as possible to do contrast ads or attacks on Trump,\" said Austin Barbour, leader of a trio of super PACs that supported Perry. \"Theres a feeling that his poll numbers are vastly inflated and will start coming down on their own, so no one wants to spend valuable resources doing what may just happen naturally.\", Club for Growth, which is paying for the ads through its super PAC, is no longer willing to wait. The clubs resident, David McIntosh, said he at first assumed that Trump wasnt a credible candidate but the candidates continued rise in the polls showed otherwise. \"Weve realized weve got to take Donald Trump seriously and really show what his record is,\" McIntosh said. Club for Growth may not seem the perfect Trump-slayer; it unsuccessfully solicited a $1 million contribution from him in June. Indeed, Trump wrote Tuesday on Twitter that the club is \"little respected\" and, having been spurned by him, is \"spending lobbyist and special interest money on ads\" against him. With the second GOP debate this week and voting in the earliest primary states less than five months away, the candidates and groups helping them are beginning to spend money on TV ads. Through the end of June, donors backing Trumps Republican opponents had given about $300 million, Federal Election Commission reports show. So far that money is helping the candidates define themselves rather than tear down Trump. Right to Rise, a super PAC created to help former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, is on the air beginning $24 million worth of ads casting the former Florida governor as a \"proven conservative\" with \"real results.\" The ads are in Iowa and New Hampshire and spread South Carolina next week. Trumps meteoric rise has come not after a slew of pricey, well-crafted advertisements, but with the benefit of intense media coverage, which costs him nothing. The Trump phenomenon \"in a weird way is showing the diminishing importance of money in politics,\" said John Jordan, a California winery owner and major Republican donor. \"And because of that, I think the flow of money is slowing to a trickle.\", Through the end of June, Trump had mostly paid his own way, lending his campaign nearly all of the $1.9 million it reported raising. The billionaire candidate has pledged to spend whatever it takes to win the GOP nomination, meaning that even the best-funded opponents or Republican groups could find themselves financially overmatched. ___, Associated Press writer Thomas Beaumont contributed to this report from Des Moines, Iowa. ___, Follow Julie Bykowicz on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/bykowicz]", "Date": "20150915", "Title": "[Club for Growth to spend $1M on TV ads going after Trump]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150915_ap_8b9569d930a24db59c0d7755014055c0.html\n", "Author": "[JULIE BYKOWICZ, The Associated Press]"}
{"Content": "[WASHINGTON (AP) - Vice President Joe Biden lashed out at Republican front-runner Donald Trump on immigration Tuesday, accusing him of reverting to \"xenophobia\" to garner support in the 2016 election. Biden, who is weighing a late entry into the Democratic presidential primary, called Trumps message \"sick\" and predicted it \"will not prevail.\", \"This will pass - the Trump stuff and that stuff that youre hearing on the other team,\" Biden said at a Hispanic Heritage Month event at his residence in Washington. Trump has roiled the Republican field with his call to remove the millions of people living in the U.S. illegally before allowing some to return. Hes also accused some Mexican immigrants of being rapists and vowed to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. Bidens comments mark a rare instance of top White House officials singling Republican presidential candidates out by name. On a visit to Iowa Monday, President Barack Obama avoided mentioning individual candidates even as he drew distinctions between Democratic and Republican positions, including on immigration. But while Obama definitely wont be on the ballot in 2016, Biden is still contemplating a run. Hes spoken movingly in recent days about the impact of his son Beaus death earlier this year and how his decision rests on whether he can make the emotional commitment to running for president. If Biden runs, his remarks Tuesday could serve as a template for his argument against Republicans in a general election. Both parties will be fighting for support from Hispanics, a fast-growing voting bloc that overwhelmingly supported Obama in the last presidential election. Biden, a Catholic, drew a distinction between Trump and Pope Francis, who is visiting the United States later this month. The popular pope has been a vocal advocate for humane treatment of immigrants and has spoken specifically about the conditions facing people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. \"Watch the response that Pope Francis gets,\" said Biden, who called the pontiff \"the single most popular man in the world.\", As Biden closed his remarks, participants yelled \"Run, Joe, Run.\", \"Oh, no, no, no, no,\" Biden said, brushing their cheers aside and offering no new insights on his political future. __, Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC]", "Date": "20150915", "Title": "[Biden: Trump's view on immigration 'will not prevail']", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150915_ap_b098e5ec089042498ae96d3549d77160.html\n", "Author": "[JULIE PACE, The Associated Press]"}
{"Content": "[LOS ANGELES (AP) - Taking aim at his potential political opponents, Vice President Joe Biden railed Wednesday against Republicans who \"deny climate change\" and want to shut down the federal government over funding for Planned Parenthood, and pleaded with them to \"just get out of the way.\", Biden came to California, a national leader on clean energy, to tout solar technology and ramp up pressure on the U.S. and other nations as the Obama administration presses for a successful finish to global climate talks. Yet his visit was infused with 2016 overtones, and he playfully mocked Republicans who reject mainstream climate science that says humans are contributing to warmer temperatures. \"I think if you pushed them, theyd probably deny gravity as well,\" Biden said. The California swing brought Biden to the same corner of the state as the pack of Republican presidential candidates, who descended on the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library for their second televised debate on Wednesday night. Addressing a solar power summit in Anaheim, Biden offered a prediction that viewers would hear more skepticism about climate change from the pack of GOP candidates participating in the debate. He also called out the billionaire Koch brothers - the Democratic Partys preferred boogeymen - for leading efforts to stymie renewable energy development, though he added sardonically that they were \"fine guys, as I understand it.\", \"We need to set an example for the whole world by eliminating these wasteful, unnecessary subsidies,\" Biden said, arguing that special interests are fighting to preserve federal tax benefits that the energy industry enjoys. As he considers a late entrance into the 2016 presidential race, Biden has started to speak out more directly against the Republican candidates he would face if he won his partys nomination. Addressing Hispanics at a reception on Tuesday night, he lashed out at GOP front-runner Donald Trump and said his \"sick\" message of xenophobia \"will not prevail.\", Bidens California trip was designed to give a boost to a key element of President Barack Obamas agenda. World leaders are working feverishly to finish a global climate treaty by December, and the vice presidents next stop in California was a U.S.-China Climate Leaders Summit in Los Angeles, where the worlds two largest polluters are aiming to ramp up pressure on other countries to match the ambitious pledges to cap or curb emissions that the U.S. and China have already laid out. Taking the stage in Los Angeles, Biden cast himself as having been ahead of the curve on climate, citing a bill he introduced in 1986. Calling the U.S.-China relationship critical to fighting climate change, Biden invoked his longstanding relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping, whom Biden courted when he was Chinas vice president. \"Tell him I miss him,\" he told visiting Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi, who met with Biden at the summit to prepare for Xis state visit to the White House next week. While in Los Angeles, Biden made time for dinner with late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel and Showtime network President David Nevins at the home of L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti. He also squeezed in a session with the secretary-treasurer of the Culinary Workers Union, whose endorsement is key for presidential candidates in the competitive state of Nevada. The vice president is deeply immersed in deliberations with his family and advisers about whether to enter the 2016 presidential race. In recent days, Biden has opened a window into those deliberations, describing his lingering doubts about whether he has the emotional strength to mount a viable campaign just months after his son, Beau, died from brain cancer. At the same time, Biden has kept up an intensive travel schedule, crisscrossing Florida, Georgia, New York and now California, stops that have done little to quell speculation that hes laying the groundwork for a potential campaign. On Thursday, Biden planned speeches on transportation and sexual assault in Ohio and Michigan - two battleground states that will play key roles in electing the next president. In tandem with Bidens trip, the White House announced that 11 Chinese cities and provinces would max out their emissions earlier than Chinas national goal of 2030. Biden also announced more than $120 million for new and existing clean energy projects in 24 states. ___, Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP]", "Date": "20150916", "Title": "[As Republicans debate, Biden knocks climate change doubters]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150916_ap_d69c28e9272f4bc8bd5206ec3c7e184e.html\n", "Author": "[JOSH LEDERMAN, The Associated Press]"}
{"Content": "[SIMI VALLEY, Calif. (AP) - The latest on the GOP presidential debates at the Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif. (all times local):, ___, 8:15 p.m. A night of debate between Republican presidential candidates has concluded after five hours of questions, answers and clashes. The conflicts arose over such issues as immigration, tax policy and vaccinations. Billionaire Donald Trump was much less combative than he had been in the previous face-off last month, and declared himself \"very impressed\" with the other candidates. ___, 8:00 p.m. Jeb Bush turns to Donald Trump and says he would have his Secret Service code name be \"Eveready, because Im very high-energy.\", Thats a dig at Trump, who routinely calls the former Florida governor \"low-energy.\" Its a critique that has struck a nerve in the former Florida governor. Asked the same question, the famously self-promoting Trump leans close to his microphone and says his name would be \"Humble.\", ___, 7:50 p.m. Donald Trump is stoking the furor against vaccinations, giving new voice to the widely discredited theory that they cause autism. He says he backs vaccinating children over longer time periods and in smaller doses. Trump says, \"You take this little beautiful baby and you pump - I mean, it looks just like its meant for a horse, not for a child.\", Medical experts have repeatedly rejected any link between the scheduled shots and higher rates of autism. When asked about Trumps theory, former neurosurgeon Ben Carson joked, \"Hes an OK doctor.\", Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee says the U.S. should place greater focus on curing diseases like diabetes. He asks, \"Why doesnt this country focus on cures rather than treatment?\", ___, 7:45 p.m. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio says hes not in favor of environmental policies that will make business more difficult for job creators. Rubio also said during the GOP presidential debate that he is skeptical of decisions Democrats want to make about climate change, saying they will do nothing to end the drought in California. He says President Obamas carbon policies wont change the climate. He says, \"America is not a planet.\", New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says its a \"wild, left-wing idea\" that the U.S. can fix climate change on its own. ___, 7:40 p.m. Jeb Bush is admitting he smoked pot in high school, an acknowledgement that came amid a debate over legalizing marijuana. He says his mother, former first lady Barbara Bush, would not be happy to hear him admit it on television. Bush notes that he opposed a medical marijuana ballot measure in Florida because there were too many \"loopholes\" in the bill. He says there is a \"serious epidemic\" of drugs in the U.S. and is pushing for more treatment and prevention programs. But he says state laws legalizing the drug should stand. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul says Bush has a double standard. While poorer people go to jail for marijuana possession, Paul says, richer users escape punishment. He says, \"America needs to take a different attitude.\", New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says his state is the first in the nation that requires mandatory drug treatment for non-violent offenders. He repeated his assertion that the \"war on drugs has been a failure,\" but said, \"that doesnt mean we should be legalizing gateway drugs.\", ___, 7:35 p.m. Mike Huckabee says \"darn right\" he would have a litmus test for Supreme Court nominees. He says, \"Im tired of the liberals having them.\", Huckabee, a leader among the social conservatives, says he would make opposition to abortion rights a linchpin to a Supreme Court nomination. The former Arkansas governor says he would ask any nominee if he or she believed a fetus is a human being \"or a lump of tissue.\", ___, 7:30 p.m. Texas Senator Ted Cruz says it was a mistake for him to support the nomination of Chief Justice John Roberts to the Supreme Court. Cruz made the admission at the second Republican presidential debate. He was criticizing the record of the Bush family in nominating justices like Roberts. The chief justice has drawn conservative ire for two votes that upheld President Obamas health overhaul. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush pointed out that Cruz had backed Roberts. He said the problem was that the nomination process has become so politicized that presidents put forward people with limited judicial track records like Roberts. Bush says, \"We need to make sure that we have justices with a proven, experienced record of respect for upholding the Constitution.\", Roberts was nominated by Jeb Bushs brother, president George W. Bush. Cruz also cited former Justice David Souter, nominated by Jeb Bushs father, President George H.W. Bush. ___, 7:20 p.m. Donald Trump is pointing out that he was against the 2003 Iraq invasion. Hes linking Jeb Bush to the war, which was ordered by his brother, then-President George W. Bush. Trump says, \"Your brother and your brothers administration gave us Barack Obama because it was such a disaster in the last three months.\", Jeb Bush, who laid out a strategy to fight radical militant jihadists at the Reagan Library last month, has discussed his philosophy of peace through strength and acting through coalitions against global threats. But when Trump attacked George W. Bush, Jeb Bush stopped cold and looked directly at Trump, saying, \"You know what, as it relates to my brother, he kept us safe.\", Its not a new line for Bush. But it earned him one of the biggest ovations of the event. ___, 7:10 p.m. Rand Paul says if voters want a president who will send troops to Iraq, \"you got 14 other choices.\", The Kentucky senator says, \"There will always be a Bush or Clinton for you if you want to go back to war in Iraq.\", Paul says the first war in Iraq was a mistake, it would not be in the United States best interests to start another one and \"Im not sending our sons and our daughters back to Iraq.\", Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says \"political restrictions\" placed on troops already in the Middle East that prevent them from taking on the Islamic State should be lifted. Walker says he will only send in troops \"when our national security is at risk.\", ___, 6:50 p.m. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is suggesting the country cant risk selecting a foreign policy novice like Donald Trump to be president. At the second GOP presidential debate, Rubio rattled off a list of threats. He cited North Korean missiles, Russian incursions into the Ukraine and China cyberattacks. He said people need to ask candidates like Trump about foreign policy because \"these are extraordinarily dangerous times.\", Rubio added that the next president had \"better be someone that understands these issues and has good judgment about them.\", Trump acknowledged he has a lot to learn about foreign policy but vowed to be up to speed in time. ___, 6:48 p.m. At a media filing center in Hillary Rodham Clintons campaign headquarters, aides put up posters of Donald Trump, Jeb Bush and other GOP candidates with quotes from Ronald Reagan that contradict the current fields policy positions. Speaking to the staff before the start of the debate, campaign manager Robby Mook gladly recited South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Grahams line from the first event, \"Hillary Clinton has a list a mile long to help the middle class.\", He said every Republican on the debate stage would support defunding Planned Parenthood. \"If Hillary Clinton is president that will never happen and thats why were here,\" Mook said. Later, Mook told reporters it was \"disturbing\" that Jeb Bush \"allowed himself to be shushed by Donald Trump.\" Mook said Trump was \"driving the show here. He has a completely out-of-date and out-of-touch philosophy and I think thats a scary prospect in the general election.\", Asked about Carly Fiorina, Mook said she got her biggest applause \"when she went on a tirade\" about defunding Planned Parenthood. ___, 6:45 p.m. Chris Christie has had enough of the criticism and counterattacks between billionaire Donald Trump and former tech company CEO Carly Fiorina. Fiorina was fired. Trump has declared bankruptcy. Christie says Americans dont care. Christie says: \"While Im as entertained as anyone by this personal back-and-forth about the history of Donald and Carlys career, for the 55-year-old construction worker out in that audience tonight who doesnt have a job, who cant fund his childs education - I gotta tell you the truth - they could care less about your careers.\", Continuing his appeal to the middle class, Christie added: \"Youre both successful people. Congratulations. The middle class in this country whos getting plowed under by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, lets start talking about those issues tonight and stop this childish back-and-forth between the two of you.\", ___, 6:40 p.m. Billionaire Donald Trump is advocating for a progressive income tax, speaking out against a flat tax where everyone pays the same percentage no matter how much they earn. Trump says during the second Republican presidential debate that its not fair for someone who makes $50,000 a year to pay the same percentage in taxes as a millionaire. Trump also promises to release a tax reform plan in a couple weeks that hedge fund managers wont like, but that those in the middle class will. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul disagrees, saying a flat 14.5 percent tax on everyone is the way to go. ___, 6:35 p.m. Carly Fiorina and Donald Trump are trading barbs about their business records. Fiorina says the roughly 30,000 layoffs she oversaw as CEO of Hewlett-Packard from 1999 to 2005 are an example of \"tough calls\" the next president will have to make. She argues the job cuts took the country from \"lagging behind to leading.\", Trump called the technology firm a \"disaster,\" blaming another 30,000 layoffs announced by the company this week on Fiorinas leadership. He says, \"She cant run any of my companies.\", Fiorina has fired back, pointing to debt and bankruptcies stemming from Trumps casino investments. She retorts, \"Why should we trust to you to manage the finances of this nation any differently than you manage the finances of our casinos?\", ___, 6:25 p.m. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina says President Obama and Democrats dont want to solve the problem of illegal immigration. She says Obama and Democrats want to have the issue as one to use against Republicans. Republican positions on immigration were a focus of the second GOP presidential debate. Donald Trump says he agrees with Fiorina that Democrats dont want to solve the immigration problem. Trump also defends his position that citizenship should not be given automatically to children born in the United States. He says the U.S. is \"dumb\" and \"stupid\" for allowing that through the 14th Amendment. He says as president he would end birthright citizenship. Fiorina says, \"You cant just wave your hands and say the 14th Amendment is going to go away.\", ___, 6:20 p.m. Jeb Bush says Donald Trump needs to apologize for attacking the background of his wife. Columba Bush is an American citizen born in Mexico. Trump has suggested Bush is too soft toward immigrants because of his marriage. At the second GOP presidential debate, Bush demanded that Trump apologize to her. Trump said he hears \"phenomenal things\" about Columba Bush but wouldnt apologize. He said his words have been misconstrued and stood by his criticism of Bush for answering some questions from reporters in Spanish. He said people in the United States should speak English. Bush said hes showing respect to people who speak both languages. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio jumped in and said its important to speak Spanish to communicate with immigrants who may become Republican voters. He recounted stories of his grandfather, a Cuban immigrant whose English was shaky but who idolized Ronald Reagan. ___, 6:15 p.m. Fiorina was asked to respond to one of the most biting insults of the 2016 campaign: \"Look at that face,\" Trump had said of her recently, going on to appear to say she didnt have the looks to be president. Fiorina used another of Trumps comments as a comeback. On the stage, he had just called out Bush for trying to walk back comments on funding womens health care. \"You know its interesting to me, Mr. Trump said that he heard Mr. Bush very clearly in what Mr. Bush said. I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said,\" she said, drawing loud applause from the live audience. Trump, looking sheepish, said, \"Shes got a beautiful face, and shes a beautiful woman.\", On the split screen on CNN, Fiorina didnt visibly react. ___, 6:10 p.m. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina says Republicans in Congress should stand fast on defunding Planned Parenthood even if it triggers a government shutdown. Fiorina spoke at the second Republican presidential debate. She said undercover videos of Planned Parenthood officials purportedly selling fetal organs make it a moral imperative to do anything possible to stop the organization. Planned Parenthood says it provides fetal tissue for medical research, charging a minor fee to cover costs. Fiorina said, \"This is about the character of our nation.\", She won the first standing ovation of night when she added, \"If we will not stand up and force President Obama to veto this bill, shame on us.\", Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush also condemned Planned Parenthood and defended his statement that the federal government should spend less on womens health care. He said he was talking specifically about Planned Parenthood but he has been attacked repeatedly by Hillary Clinton for the line. ___, 6:05 p.m. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is touting his anti-abortion rights record but stopping short of saying hed shut down the government to defund Planned Parenthood. Asked three times whether he would press to defund the womens health organization even if it results in a government closure, Christie punted on the question. Christie says hed put it \"on the list\" of issues that Republicans should use to force a compromise from President Barack Obama, along with tax legislation. Christie has described the past government shutdown, which Republicans forced over the health care law, as a political misstep for the GOP. ___, 5:55 p.m. In an exchange on gay marriage and religious liberty, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee argued forcefully for the right of Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis to defy the Supreme Courts decision legalizing gay marriage. \"I thought that everyone here passed ninth-grade civics. The courts cant legislate,\" he said. \"I thought we had three branches of government.\", Huckabee declined to criticize former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush for saying Davis does not have the right to deny gays marriage licenses. Bush said he supports defending the rights of religious people to refuse to endorse gay marriage, but he said someone else in Davis office should sign the certificates since the Supreme Court ruling is the law of the land. \"I think there needs to be accommodation for someone acting on their faith,\" he said. __, 5:53 p.m. Donald Trump says President Barack Obama doesnt have courage. The billionaire, asked whether Congress bears responsibility for the Syrian refugee crisis, says he would have gone in with \"tremendous force\" when the Syrian regime attacked its own people. That was in response to a question about whether Congress is responsible for backing Obama, who refused to order military action after the Assad regime attacked Syrians. Trump says: \"Somehow he just doesnt have courage. Theres something missing from our president.\", ___, 5:51 p.m. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush say the next president should not immediately reverse the nuclear agreement with Iran. The Republican party was staunchly against the deal cut by the Obama administration. Several GOP candidates have vowed to overturn the agreement, should they win the White House. Paul took a different approach, saying it would be \"absurd\" to \"cut up the agreement immediately.\", Bush echoed that position, saying \"its not a strategy to tear up an agreement.\" Instead, he would strengthen ties with Israel, a move he says will create \"a healthier deterrent effect than anything else I can think of.\", ___, 5:45 p.m. Donald Trump says as president he would get along better with world leaders, including Russias Vladimir Putin, than President Obama and that will make the world more stable. Trump says Putin has \"absolutely no respect for President Obama.\", Florida Sen. Marco Rubio says Putin is \"trying to replace us as the single most important power broker in the Middle East.\", And former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina says Russia is a bad actor and the only way to stop Putin is to show \"strength and resolve.\" She says she would rebuild the U.S. missile defense system as part of her foreign policy strategy. ___, 5:40 p.m. Jeb Bush and Donald Trump are mixing it up over big-money donors influence. Trump has contended that Bush and others are puppets of their campaign contributors. At the second Republican presidential debate, Bush shot back. He said Trump once gave him money hoping to expand casino gambling in Florida while Bush was governor there. But Bush stood firm. Trump denied he wanted the gaming expansion. The two men began to argue. Bush noted that Hillary Clinton attended Trumps most recent wedding and said the developer has praised House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Trump said he had to get along with all politicians and quipped that Bush has \"more energy.\" He has been making fun of what he calls Bushs low-energy presentation for weeks. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson jumped into the exchange. Hes risen in polls to just behind Trump and boasted he has refused to court big donors. Carson said he would not \"lick the boots of billionaires.\", ___, 5:32 p.m. Ohio Gov. John Kasich figuratively is waving his arms at the start of the debate, which has quickly turned into a group attack on Donald Trump. Kasich says anyone tuning into the debate would see it and change the channel. He says with desperation in his voice: \"People want to know what were going to do to fix this place. It may be buzzing out there. But I think its important that we get to the issues.\", ___, 5:35 p.m. Neurosurgeon Ben Carson is declining to single out his rivals for attack, saying hes running because he concerned about the countrys divisiveness and fiscal state. He says, \"I dont want to really get into describing whos a politician and whos not.\", Carson has cast himself as an outsider running above the political fray. ___, 5:29 p.m. Scott Walker is asserting himself early in the second Republican presidential debate by going after front-runner Donald Trump. Walker tells Trump: \"We dont need an apprentice in the White House. We have one right now.\" And he says Trump has put projects into bankruptcy and he cant do that to America. Trump says he would do better than Walker has leading Wisconsin since 2011, saying the state is losing $2.2 billion. The state faced that shortfall heading into this year, but Walker signed a budget in July that eradicated it. Walker says he is someone who will take on the special interests in Washington and fight for average Americans. ___, 5:28 p.m. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is unveiling a new line of attack against Donald Trump at the opening of tonights debate: Hes too brash to lead. Paul is arguing that Trumps temperament would make him untrustworthy in high-level international negotiations. Paul says hes worried about having Trump in control of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, citing his \"careless language\" and attack on peoples appearances. Trump quickly shot back with a slam on Paul: \"I never attacked him on his looks and believe me theres plenty of substance right there.\", ___, 5:25 p.m. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina isnt saying whether she trusts Donald Trump in control of the countrys nuclear arsenal. Fiorina punted on the first question posed in the second Republican presidential debate, about whether she felt comfortable with Trump having access to the nuclear launch codes. Instead, Fiorina calls Trump a \"wonderful man,\" adding that \"all of us will be revealed over time and under pressure.\", She says whether Trump can be trusted with nuclear weapons is for voters to decide. ___, 5:20 p.m. In introducing themselves, several Republican candidates for president are genuflecting at Ronald Reagans tomb, not far from the library where they are debating. Ohios John Kasich points behind him at the Air Force One: \"I actually flew in that plane.\", Floridas Marco Rubio credits Reagan for inspiring his public service and \"love of country.\", And Wisconsins Scott Walker says he is in the mold of Reagan, whom America needs \"now more than ever.\", ___, 5:18 p.m. Gov. Chris Christie is kicking off the second GOP presidential debate by saying Barack Obama has drained America of hope. The New Jersey governor used his introduction to ask CNN to turn the camera from him to the audience. He asked the crowd in the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library to raise their hands if they believed their children had a better future due to Barack Obama. No hands went up. Christie promised to reverse that. ___, 5:12 p.m. The debate between top-tier Republican presidential candidates is under way. Eleven candidates are opening the debate with introductions. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee took a shot at Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton and her use of a private email server while secretary of state. Former neurosurgeon Ben Carson says hes in the race because hes concerned about the future for Americas children. Front-runner Donald Trump reminds the crowd hes \"made billions and billions of dollars.\"]", "Date": "20150916", "Title": "[The Latest: GOP marathon turned on immigration, tax issues]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150916_ap_ebe543c0fd2348b2a6dfd9958f8fef7a.html\n", "Author": "[ The Associated Press]"}
{"Content": "[LOS ANGELES - Amid all the bombast in the Republican race for president, Ben Carson comes across more like a whisper. He is, in some ways, the anti-Trump - a gentle candidate who lets his record as a renowned brain surgeon speak for itself. The bragging about his resume and place in the polls, on the rare occasions it comes, is delivered with none of the superlatives that Donald Trump cant seem to go without. Yet the 63-year-old Republican, the only African American seeking the White House in 2016 - has tapped into the same wave of antiestablishment outrage fueling the billionaire reality TV stars rise. \"The likelihood of someone like me getting through this process and making it to president is virtually impossible,\" Carson said in a recent interview. \"I just have to be myself. And if being myself resonates with the American people, then they will choose me. \"And if it doesnt,\" he said, \"they will choose somebody else.\", Like Trump, Carson was dismissed early as a gaffe-prone novice lacking a national profile and any significant political network. But he appears to be connecting with Republican voters at a rate that even his closest aides didnt predict. Heading into Wednesday nights second debate of the GOP contest, Carson finds himself alongside Trump atop the field. A New York Times/CBS News poll released Tuesday shows Carson favored by 23 percent of likely Republican primary voters compared with Trumps 27 percent. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, meanwhile, have plummeted to 6 percent and 2 percent respectively. It should be noted the poll found that 63 percent said they could change their minds before the primaries begin with the Iowa caucuses in February. Yet it was just one of several in recent days that feature the political rookies Trump and Carson leading a field of veterans of elected office, offering the clearest example yet that GOP voters have deep frustrations with the political establishment. It shows in Carsons fund-raising, too. His campaign says it has raised $5 million so far this month, adding to the $9 million it pulled in during July and August - a strong performance at what is typically one of the hardest times for candidates to raise money. Wednesday night offers Carson a new chance to build on that momentum. A stage full of GOP candidates will face off at the Reagan Presidential Library for the partys second formal debate. Carson emerged from the first as a surprise success, his popularity fueled by his nice-guy image on a night when his competitors came out swinging. Yet he remains rough around the edges and has little experience with issues beyond health care and business, particularly foreign policy in an election where international affairs are a major part of the discussion. \"Hes memorized every nerve in the body, he can memorize the top 12 terrorists in the world,\" said Carson campaign manager Barry Bennett, dismissing any concerns. ]", "Date": "20150916", "Title": "[Low-key Carson gains in the Republican race]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150916_Low-key_Carson_gains_in_the_Republican_race.html\n", "Author": "[Steve Peoples, Associated Press]"}
{"Content": "[WASHINGTON (AP) - The Democratic leaders of the House and Senate huddled with President Barack Obama on Thursday to discuss strategy as Congress prepares for some momentous decisions on how best to keep the federal government operating. A partial shutdown will occur Oct. 1 unless lawmakers provide money to keep the federal government functioning. A few weeks later, Congress likely will need to vote to raise the debt ceiling so that the government can borrow money to meet its existing financial commitments. The White House, in a statement Thursday evening, said Obama \"reiterated that threats by some Republicans to shut down the government and eliminate access to health care for men, women and families across the country is a game of chicken with our economy that we cannot accept.\", Obamas meeting with Sen. Harry Reid and Rep. Nancy Pelosi occurred as the Senates top Republican, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, is promising there will be no government shutdown. McConnell reiterated Wednesday that there will be a negotiation with the White House over easing cuts to both the Pentagon and domestic programs, a key demand of Obamas. And he predicted for the first time that they would \"crack\" budget caps set by a 2011 budget-cutting law. The White House has repeatedly threatened to veto any spending bill that keeps the automatic spending curbs, also referred to as sequestration. In a speech to business leaders Wednesday, Obama told Congress to aim higher than just passing a budget. \"If we dont reverse the cuts that are currently in place, a lot of the drivers of growth that your companies depend on - research, job training, infrastructure, education for our workforce - they are going to be reduced effectively at a time when other countries around the world are racing to get ahead of us,\" Obama told members of the Business Roundtable, a group of CEOs from large companies. Obama made clear in his speech to the Business Roundtable that he will blame Republicans for any impasse that results in a government shutdown or leads to the impression there will be one, creating stress in the markets. \"Youll recall two years ago Republicans shut down the government because they didnt like Obamacare. Today, some are suggesting the government should be shut down because they dont like Planned Parenthood,\" Obama said. \"Thats not good sense, and its not good business.\", The president followed up his speech with a fundraising email to Democratic supporters Thursday. In it, he urged contributions to help elect Democrats to \"a Congress that wont play politics with peoples lives,\" and called the current budget standoff \"unacceptable.\", To reach a deal, the GOP-led Congress must take steps that include overcoming opposition from some lawmakers who want to block federal funding for Planned Parenthood, amid controversy about the organization providing fetal tissue from abortions for research. Some conservatives also face pressure to keep government spending within the levels agreed to through the 2011 legislation. \"Hard-working Americans deserve to have their policymakers live up to their promises on spending,\" said a letter to members of Congress signed by numerous conservative groups, including the Club for Growth, Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce and Americans for Tax Reform. The letter said that \"even with these modest spending limits, discretionary spending will still increase in 2016 and every year thereafter.\", Going into the budget showdown, Obama is trying to make the case that the economy has greatly improved and that Congress shouldnt do anything that would jeopardize economic growth. \"Americas winning right now. Americas great right now. We can do even better,\" Obama said. _____, Associated Press writers Nancy Benac and Andrew Taylor contributed to this report.]", "Date": "20150917", "Title": "[Obama, Democratic leaders huddle as shutdown threat looms]", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150917_ap_ed5756882aa54a1b83692a67fd6d466b.html\n", "Author": "[KEVIN FREKING, The Associated Press]"}
{"Content": "[COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - In any other year, a pair of speeches by Vice President Joe Biden on transportation and sexual assault would raise few eyebrows in the political world. This isnt any other year. Bidens visits to Ohio and Michigan on Thursday were closely watched for signs hes gauging his support in two states that typically play a key role in electing the next president. As he considers making a late entrance into the 2016 presidential race, his usual vice presidential appearances have taken on the air of campaign stops, with supporters cheering for him to run. The vice president didnt tip his hand at either stop, eschewing talk of the presidential race for wonkier discourse about infrastructure upgrades and economic development. The closest to a reminder of the political speculation swirling around him came, ironically, at an event in Columbus on the scourge of sexual violence on American college campuses. At Ohio State University - where President Barack Obama kicked off his victorious re-election campaign three years ago - more than a thousand students packed into a gymnasium and chanted \"Joe, Joe, Joe\" as they waited for Biden to take the stage. When he did, he was met with thunderous cheers as he saluted students and showed off his scarlet tie evoking the schools official colors. He got a bit of celebrity boost, too, from \"Hunger Games\" star Josh Hutcherson, who flew from Los Angeles with Biden aboard Air Force Two to attend the rally. \"Every single woman on the plane all of a sudden had no interest in talking to me,\" the vice president quipped. The sprawling public university of more than 60,000 students announced new steps to prevent sexual violence, including mandatory awareness training for all freshmen starting next year. The school plans to dedicate a team to investigating allegations of sexual misconduct and to partner with a local sexual assault hotline. Biden told the students it was never appropriate to ask a domestic violence victim what she said or did that led to being victimized. \"The question we as a nation have we to ask is what made him think he had a right to raise his hand,\" Biden said, his voice rising to a roar. Its a theme resonating in this years Democratic presidential primary. Earlier this week in Iowa, Hillary Rodham Clinton put forth her plan to try to end sexual assault on campuses. Like the rally at Ohio State, Bidens visit to Detroit tapped into an issue that has long been central to Bidens identity as a political leader - and could play an equally important role in his message to voters should he choose to run for president. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan joined Biden at the citys transportation headquarters, where the vice president got behind the wheel of one of the citys new hybrid and clean diesel buses, purchased with help from federal grants. Standing in front of the extra-long bus with a city driver, Biden said hed once been a school bus driver - but wasnt sure he could handle one like this. \"This is cool, man,\" said the vice president. Ohio and Michigan are among a handful of states that are competitive for Democrats and Republicans, although Michigan has trended Democratic in recent presidential elections. Obama won both in 2008 and 2012. The vice president has been deeply immersed in deliberations with his family and advisers about whether to enter the 2016 race. In recent days, Biden has described his lingering doubts about whether he has the emotional strength to mount a viable campaign just months after his sons death. Hes also started to speak out more directly against the Republican candidates he would face if he won the nomination. After denouncing front-runner Donald Trump on Tuesday for promoting a \"sick\" anti-immigrant message, Biden mocked Republicans who question global warming during a visit to California. \"I think if you pushed them, theyd probably deny gravity as well,\" he said. ___, Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP]", "Date": "20150917", "Title": "[In key 2016 states, Biden hears chants of 'Joe, Joe, Joe']", "Link": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20150917_ap_fd6f8ebba4bb41ef91d36af3917be38d.html\n", "Author": "[JOSH LEDERMAN, The Associated Press]"}
