Michelle demonstrates a real interest in the opportunities and challenges facing District 113 by attending board meetings, meeting with administrators and teachers, and holding discussions with current and former board members. Michelle is a Deerfield resident and should she fail to earn a seat on the board, Deerfields representation will consist of only one seat. Debbie has served our communities as a member of the District 113 board for four years and as a member of the District 112 board for 12 years. She is a lifelong learner, with a passion for our students, teachers and administrators and maintains a constant presence at student events, staff institute days and community events.

{"Content": "[When it comes to kids and food, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is pragmatic: \"Give kids a choice between French fries and green beans, theyre going to pick French fries because theyre delicious.\" Last summer, the junior senator from New York and mom to two young boys spoke about the need for more healthful school-lunch standards at a Senate committee hearing. She believes all kids deserve healthful, fresh, well-prepared foods so they can develop a taste for them at an early age. Gillibrands mother was an attorney. Her grandmother worked for the New York State Legislature. She observed from both women that \"doing it all\"  raising kind, empathetic children; nurturing a marriage; running a household; and helping people in need, while working full time  was not easy, but possible and fulfilling. In the mid-1990s, a speech by Hillary Rodham Clinton, then first lady, spurred Gillibrand, a corporate attorney, to become politically active, first as a volunteer, then as a Democratic candidate. In 2006, voters in upstate New York elected her to Congress. When Clinton became secretary of State in 2009, Gillibrand was appointed to fill her Senate seat. She later won a special election and, in 2012, was reelected in a landslide. As Dartmouth College undergrads, Gillibrand and actress Connie Britton studied together in China. At the time, did Gillibrand, now 48, think the two might become the most famous members of their class? \"Definitely not!\" she says with a laugh. Gillibrand considers longtime friendships with Britton and other women to be a vital complement to her work and family life. How have you introduced your sons, Theo, 11, and Henry, 6, to exercise?, My husband and I hike with them. I encourage them to play sports and not give up early.

How did you approach post-pregnancy weight loss?, I wanted to be healthy and fit, so I started playing competitive sports again.... I joined the womens softball team in Congress. At a public gym I started playing squash and tennis again. I run outdoors wherever I am. [Exercise] is my \"me\" time. It keeps me sane and well centered. What foods do you make?

{"Content": "[The surprise retirement of Sen. Harry Reid, the gritty top Democrat in Congress, risks unraveling perhaps the biggest accomplishment of his combative decade in leadership: keeping unruly Democrats united in support of President Obamas agenda and rebuffing an overtly divided GOP. As recently as a few weeks ago, the former amateur boxer gave every indication he would seek reelection in 2016, despite a New Years exercise mishap that left him nearly blinded in one eye. On Friday, the Capitol Hill veteran called it quits, suggesting he preferred to leave a legacy while still in his prime rather than overstay his effectiveness. Somebody should go when theyre still pretty good, Reid said in an interview Friday morning at his home near the Georgetown neighborhood. The 75-year-old Nevadan made it clear that he was leaving on his own terms  not because of his accident, Senate Democrats new minority status or worries about his upcoming reelection campaign. I want to be remembered for when I was able to bat third or cleanup a lot of the time, he said, sitting on a comfortable couch dressed in khakis, a gray cardigan and uncharacteristically colorful striped socks  his special sunglasses still protecting his injured eye. For Democrats, the challenge ahead is whether the post-Reid party can tamp down the growing ideological differences between liberal and more centrist Democrats, navigate a rare transfer of party leadership, and avoid the kind of infighting that has all but paralyzed their Republican colleagues. The timing is particularly sensitive as Democrats look toward the 2016 election, when they have a chance to regain the Senate majority after the Republican takeover this year. There hasnt been an active campaign for the top Democratic leadership position in either the House or Senate since Reid won his current post in 2005. Eager to avoid a leadership fight, Reid promptly anointed the No. 3 Democrat, Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York, as his successor. Schumer, in 22 months  if he plays his cards right  should be able to do it, Reid said. I said, If you need my help, you got it. If Im going to be in your way, Ill get out of your way., Admired for his Wall Street fundraising skills and political savvy, Schumer has made no secret of his desire for the job. But the New Yorkers bold personality is more polarizing among Democrats than Reids. The long-running joke in Washington is that the most dangerous place to be is between Schumer and a television camera  leaving some wary of elevating a leader who could be seen as an East Coast version of another divisive Democrat, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco. On the other hand, Schumer could be a natural bridge for Democrats if Hillary Rodham Clinton were to occupy the White House after 2016. She and Schumer served together for eight years when Clinton was the junior New York senator. Reids choice jumps over the partys current No. 2, Assistant Minority Leader Sen. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois. But an aide to Durbin said he threw his support to Schumer. Reids endorsement is important, but may not resolve the matter. Activists immediately began drafting liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) for the post. Though her ascent seems to be a long shot, her influence will continue to register in the party. Reid told Obama of his decision during a long conversation late Thursday. He said the men recounted their political battles together and reflected on what still needed to be accomplished before both leave office after next years election. There are things we need to do, Reid said, pointing to the military campaign against Islamic State militants, climate change and other issues. Obama has leaned heavily on Reid to implement his policies, most notably with the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Even when Reid at times disagreed on strategy or tactics, he frequently served as a buffer for the president, protecting him from Republican attempts to undercut the administrations policies. Harry has become not only an ally, but a friend, Obama said Friday in a statement. Im proud of all we have accomplished together, and I know the Senate will not be the same without him. With Reid now positioned as a lame duck for the next two years, Obama may be losing a trusted ally if the minority leaders political influence begins to wane. At the same time, Reids decision to bow out in 2016 could leave other senators feeling less inclined to stick to a unified party position. For Obama, that could help advance some of his priorities, such as providing the few Democratic votes he needs to pass the 12-nation Asian trade pact. The accord is opposed by most Democratic lawmakers but supported by most Republicans. Republicans are certain to try to capitalize on the moment of potential Democratic disarray. Hit the road, Harry, cheered a fundraising appeal from Tea Party Express, a political action committee. Conservative groups had made Reid their No. 1 target last time he ran, in 2010, and intended to do so again. News of his retirement brings us great pleasure, the PAC said. Reids retirement provides Republicans with what is likely to be their best opportunity to pick up an additional Senate seat in 2016. A race that was considered close but leaning in Reids direction suddenly has become a toss-up and will be among the most closely watched and probably hardest-fought in the country. Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval is the overwhelming favorite of the Republican establishment to succeed Reid, though he seems to have all but taken himself out of the race. Reid has endorsed Catherine Cortez Masto, a former state attorney general now serving as executive vice chancellor of the Nevada System of Higher Education. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said that Reid was underestimated often, noting that his distinctive grit and determined focus  continue to make him a formidable opponent today. Even some Democrats have bristled at Reids tight-fisted style as Senate majority leader from 2007 to 2015, including his refusal to allow amendment votes. Reid had been increasingly blamed for Senate gridlock and dysfunction, which some Democrats said may have contributed to the partys losses in the November election. In Washington, Reid may be most remembered for changing Senate filibuster rules to allow approval of Obamas nominees. In the end, a man who pulled himself up from the forlorn little mining town of Searchlight, Nev. said he felt he had done all he could do. The senator had made a preliminary decision over the Christmas holiday that he was ready to retire, an aide said, but then the accident brought out his fighting instinct. He wanted to regain his footing before moving forward with such a momentous decision. Even with its many gray-haired statesmen, the Senate can be unkind to lawmakers who cling to office. Reid would be in his mid-80s by the time another term came to a close, and the senator, who grew up listening to radio broadcasts of baseball games and always imagined himself playing the outfield, said he didnt want to finish his career as a designated hitter. In Nevada, Reid has left his imprint  not just on the few buildings bearing his name, but on policies to develop renewable energy resources that have sometimes caused controversy. Some credit  or blame  him for single-handedly stopping the nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain outside Las Vegas. The senator said that he had no interest in becoming a lobbyist or a high-powered lawyer, but that he might write another book. The one thing thats not on my to-do list is: Im not going to spend more time with my kids, said Reid, who is known for his crusty way of saying what others may think but not express. He said he and his wife, Landra, talk to their children every day and have a pet peeve about citing that reason for retirement. We just think thats obnoxious. lisa.mascaro@latimes.com, michael.memoli@latimes.com, mark.barabak@latimes.com, ]", "Date": "20150327", "Title": "[Sen.

{"Content": "[As we prepare to vote in this historic Naperville municipal election, one of the things that strikes me is the contrast between our present slate of candidates and the slate of presumptive candidates for the 2016 presidential election. I honestly believe I could live with any number of the former, but none of the latter. That is not to say we should simply throw darts at the list of candidates, although that is often the way cynics suggest our elections have been conducted in the past. We may be fortunate that any of our candidates could do a decent job, but we should want more than that. This time we have the opportunity to elect a council in which the temperaments and experiences of the entire membership can be complementary. This time we can elect a council with a shared vision of the future and the collective will to lead us there on a road that is paved with creative compromise. I have argued that to select the right mix of candidates we must question them a little less politely than we usually do. Because this is being written on Thursday, I have obviously not heard the third forum run by the Naperville Homeowners Confederation, but believe it will be similar to the others, concentrating on increasing revenue, attracting business, and personal motivation. Thats fine, but if youre a long time resident north of the downtown, you might want to see a little more pointed questioning about overlay districts and residential buffers. If you work for a licensed taxi company, you may want to know what the candidates really think about the fact that the ride sharing service Uber plans to offer free rides around the Fourth of July next summer. Napervilles involvement with the Illinois Municipal Electricity Agency is a ticking time bomb. The Prairie State Energy Campus plants have design and construction deficiencies, have never run at their promised capacity, and use dirty, high sulfur coal that may be strictly regulated in the future. All the municipal agencies that invested in it will be paying well above market rates far into the future. All but one councilman voted for this thing at the time. Why dont we ask these candidates what they think we should do?, Since reputable dog breeders never, ever sell their dogs to pet stores or on the Internet, candidates who take refuge in the legalese defining a puppy mill are being evasive. Maybe Naperville doesnt have the money to defend a legal challenge to an ordinance, but there should be no doubt how each candidate feels about this despicable business. And its the same with tearing down the Central Parking Facility. Its the wrong thing to do in the near future even if it werent so expensive. Also, has anyone else noticed that, in all the discussion of our terrible parking problems and downtown traffic congestion, not one candidate has mentioned public transportation?, I can see why a candidate wouldnt want to talk about all the hoops we make business owners jump through to open a business here, which may explain our empty strip malls, or how black people feel they are being treated by our citizens and the police. It may be that they dont know anything about such things, but if theyre going to serve on the council they should find out. If you dont know how your candidates feel about these and other issues, you still have time to ask. They all have web sites, and most of them will accept phone calls. Youll find out eventually, and better now than after theyre elected.

{"Content": "[John Greuling, president of the Will County Center for Economic Development, is urging Gov. Bruce Rauner not to \"stick a fork\" in the Illiana Tollway project, despite its apparent financial challenges. A six-page report issued by the center this month says the need for the toll road between Interstate 57 near Wilmington to I-65 near Lowell, Ind. \"has never been greater than today\" and would be a catalyst for economic growth. But it also points out that the \"state was unable to obtain an investment grade rating\" last year from Fitch Ratings, a major bond rating agency, indicating a high risk of default on the projects financing plan through a private-public partnership  information that was not previously disclosed publicly by the Illinois Department of Transportation. Rauner issued an order soon after taking office in January, putting on hold all major public works projects in Illinois until his administration could review their cost effectiveness. He has expressed skepticism regarding the need for the Illiana Tollway but has not come out against it. Under the existing plan, the 47-mile road would be built and operated by a private company or consortium through a partnership with the state and financed in part with a bond issue that would be paid off by the toll income. The project has been highly controversial, with its advocates saying its badly needed to relieve increasing truck traffic on I-80 related to Will Countys large intermodal centers and opponents contending that the high tolls required would discourage use of the road  leading to insufficient toll revenue to cover the bond debt and requiring taxpayers to help cover it. IDOT last year asked the Illinois Finance Authority to hire Fitch Ratings a year ago for $112,000 to seek a bond rating for IDOT, which was necessary to sell low-cost bonds under federal law. IDOT spokesman Guy Tridgell said the department was informed verbally by Fitch, when is unclear, that the financial plan for the estimated $1.5 billion toll road \"would not receive a favorable rating due to the financial position of the state of Illinois.\" There was no written report issued with supporting documentation from Fitch, Tridgell said. State Rep. Jack Franks, D-Woodstock, chairman of the House Committee on State Government Administration, doesnt understand how or why there would be no written report. \"No one in the real world would pay $112,000 for a verbal report. Its crazy,\" Franks said, adding that hes demanding that IDOT put the report in writing. \"Maybe they did not want something people could discover.\", The legislature \"entitled to know,\" Franks said. \"Id like to know what we spent $112,000 on. I know nothing. This sounds more like politics than policy.\", \"Fitch Ratings apparently concluded that IDOTs Illiana Tollway financing plan could not receive an investment grade rating but instead amounted to the proverbial junk bonds,\" said Howard Learner, of the Environmental Law and Policy Center, which has strongly opposed the tollway as not needed and a potential financial sinkhole. \"In short, the proposed Illiana Tollway is not financially viable for most investors to be interested,\" Learner said. \"By the numbers, the ... (tollway) does not come within the proverbial 50 country miles of making any financial sense. Its a financial boondoggle.\", Under the administration of former Gov. Pat Quinn, who was defeated for re-election, the plan was to finance Illinois $900 million share of the bi-state road through the states first public-private partnership with state money and the bond sale, with the debt repaid with toll revenue. The report by the Will County Center for Economic Development says that after Fitch issued its rating, IDOT increased its financial commitment from $200 million to $400 million, with $250 million more from the private partners, and $250 million from the bond issue. Greuling said he is not second-guessing Fitch Ratings, and if the plan is not acceptable to the bond market, the state should pursue other financial proposals. \"We have time,\" he said, noting that the federal decision approving the project has a 7 to 10 year shelf life. \"Im interested in moving forward no matter what. Federal and state governments do not have the money for it, that has been the premise all along,\" Greuling said. \"The leaders of the two states have to decide what is acceptable.\", Delays and a lack of an alternative financing plan have left private investors with a \"great deal of uncertainty\" and will make it difficult for the state to pursue a public-private partnership in the future, according to the Will County centers report. Greuling said other funding sources could include impact fees from adjacent land development or even getting the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority to build and operate the tollway. \"Everything is on the table. Our goal is to put a financing package together that works,\" he said. \"IDOT is telling us they are seriously looking at the project. I could not ask for anything more.\", Greuling said he has met with Rauners staff, telling them the Illiana is \"economically viable to the entire state.\", \"They said, show us. So we went back to information we had collected and gave it to them,\" he said, explaining why the centers report was produced. The recently disclosed Fitch Ratings evaluation was included, based on documentation from the Illinois Finance Authority, Greuling said. The economic development centers report says that without the new toll road, there will be a 21 percent decline in accessibility to jobs, a 324 percent increase in truck traffic diverted to local roads and a \"significant level of congestion\" on I-80, which would \"choke economic growth in the region and state.\", The tollway also would support 3,270 jobs per year from 2015 to 2018 and an average of 872 jobs over a 30-year horizon, according to the report. It also concludes that the Illiana Tollway will generate toll revenue that \"in the long run will result in a positive return on investment and create additional money\" for future infrastructure projects. slafferty@tribpub.com]", "Date": "20150327", "Title": "[Ratings firm's undisclosed report sees Illiana as financial risk]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com//suburbs/daily-southtown/news/ct-sta-illiana-financing-st-0329-20150327-story.html\n", "Author": "[Susan DeMar Lafferty]"}
{"Content": "[Mayor Rahm Emanuel has reduced spending and increased fines, fees and certain taxes to shrink the chronic budget deficits left over from his predecessor, Richard M. Daley. But four years after taking office, Emanuel still at times resorts to Daleys questionable budget tactics as the mayor struggles to manage the debt he inherited without raising property taxes. Documents show the mayor has used long-term bonds to put off paying $235 million for short-lived expenditures  and is making plans to borrow up to $255 million more to postpone payment of new bills coming due. Marathon campaigning continues after Thursday evenings debate. Marathon campaigning continues after Thursday evenings debate. Many of those new bills, $170 million worth, are principal payments on bonds issued years ago. Finance officials said they expect to use the citys short-term borrowing authority, akin to a city credit card, to make the payments by mid-April  then issue another long-term bond to pay off the credit. The remaining $85 million in bills, which stem overwhelmingly from Daleys failed Olympic bid, his privatization of the citys parking meters and other Daley-era deals, has already been paid with credit. Finance officials said they may repay that credit with long-term bonds as well  though they said it would be a last resort. Their strategy buys immediate relief, but deferring bills costs more over the long run  and saddles future taxpayers with the extra expense. The alternative  paying the bills with operating revenues  would require painful tax hikes, officials said in statements and interviews. About 16 percent of the citys $7.3 billion budget already goes to debt payments, squeezing funding for core services like public safety. Chicagos difficulties \"cant be reversed overnight,\" city spokeswoman Kelley Quinn said in a statement, repeating a common refrain of the mayors. \"It took decades to build the mountain of debt and substantial structural budget deficit that Mayor Emanuel inherited.\", As the city heads into a mayoral runoff, Emanuels continued reliance on borrowing for short-term costs offers a sobering reminder of the long shadow Daleys buy now, pay later budgeting strategy has cast over city finances. How well the mayor has handled that challenge has become a subject of debate as Emanuel prepares to face challenger Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia in the April 7 runoff election. Through cost cuts, revenue hikes and steps to streamline City Hall, Emanuel has reduced the citys budget deficit and slightly increased reserves. But hes struggled to pay off debt as it comes due, extricate the city from complex Daley-era financial deals known as derivatives, pay off land purchased in connection with Daleys 2016 Olympics bid and cover legal settlements related to police conduct during Daleys 22-year tenure. The Emanuel administration laid out details of past and future borrowing this month in filings and in response to Tribune questions after Moodys Investors Service downgraded the citys debt rating in February to two notches above junk status. Garcia has cited the decision by Moodys and a recent downgrade of Chicago Public Schools as signs of poor financial stewardship. Emanuel points to his success in shrinking the city budget deficit and contends hes better prepared to guide the city through its financial problems. Emanuels financial strategy to date has relied in part on the citys short-term borrowing authority, which takes the form of either a line of credit arranged with a bank or short-term loans known as commercial paper. The city pays $5 million a year  plus interest on any outstanding short-term debt  to maintain access to that credit. Though Emanuel has issued far less long-term debt than Daley did in his final term, the mayor has twice increased the limit on how much short-term debt the city can have outstanding, raising the ceiling from $200 million to $1 billion. Cities typically use this type of short-term borrowing to tide them over for a few months until revenues, such as property taxes, come in. Thats how Emanuel will repay $205 million in outstanding credit that he used to cover costs like back pay for police and running the library system, finance officials said. But unlike New York City, Houston or even cash-strapped Philadelphia, Chicago also uses taxable 30-year bonds to pay off short-term credit. The fact that Chicago uses expensive, taxable bonds for that purpose is an acknowledgment of sorts that the costs covered by the short-term credit do not benefit the taxpayers who will repay the debt in the future. Cities are allowed to borrow at much cheaper tax-exempt rates to fund projects that have some long-term use, such as a bridge or a school. The $235 million in long-term taxable debt that the Emanuel administration has already used to pay back short-term borrowing is 23 percent more than the $191 million used that way during Daleys last term. Emanuel is \"trying to hang on while hes adjusting other parts of the citys spending habit,\" said Michael Pagano, dean of the University of Illinois at Chicagos College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs. But credit will not solve the problems Emanuel inherited, he said. \"These are  I wouldnt say Band-Aids because that usually means the wound is going to heal,\" Pagano said. \"These are short-term bridges to get us to some other point, to some other long-term solution. What will that solution be? is the question.\", The $235 million that Emanuel converted to taxable bonds includes $86 million that was already on credit when Emanuel took office in 2011, finance officials said. They said Daley had used the credit to cover retroactive pay increases after contract negotiations with firefighters. The remainder included more than $100 million for legal settlements related to police conduct under Daley and a 2013 payment to the company that now holds the lease on the citys parking meters. Because Daley underestimated how often disabled drivers would park in metered spaces for free, the city now must compensate the parking meter company annually for lost revenue. A state law change will drastically reduce that cost beginning this year, but the city has paid about $20 million for the past few years. Chicagos debt management policy says \"long-term debt will not be used to fund city operations.\" City finance officials said they dont consider costs like legal settlements or even the annual payments for disabled parking to be operating expenses, referring to them instead as \"legacy costs.\", Craig Johnson, an associate professor at Indiana Universitys School of Public and Environmental Affairs, said a government unable to cover such costs with revenues should make lasting changes, such as raising taxes or cutting services. Paying those bills with short-term credit and taxable bonds simply delays those changes, racking up interest costs in the process, he said. For example, Chicagoans will pay 30 years worth of interest  at a rate of 6.3 percent  on legal settlements paid out in 2013. \"Youre turning a short-term problem into a long-term budgetary problem,\" Johnson said. Emanuels mayoral campaign has said he views a property tax increase as \"the very last resort.\", A \"last resort\" is also how city finance officials described the idea of using taxable bonds to repay the $85 million in outstanding credit from the Olympic bid and other expenses. But they said they have not ruled out the possibility. The citys outstanding debt includes more than $20 million in interest on a loan used to buy the site of the former Michael Reese Hospital as the potential location of an Olympic Village, $18.5 million for the 2014 disabled parking payment and more than $40 million in 2013 to terminate burdensome Daley-era derivative deals known as interest rate swaps. Ending the deals brought an end to costly annual payments but required the city to pay out the full value of decadeslong contracts. The finance department expects to use taxable debt to repay $170 million in credit used to cover upcoming bond payments, a strategy analysts have nicknamed \"scoop and toss\" because it scoops up todays debt and tosses it  plus interest  into the future. Emanuels finance department is committed to ending the practice of scoop and toss by 2019, officials said. The appeal of short-term credit will likely continue to grow as the city prepares to face what may be the most burdensome liability the Emanuel administration inherited. After years of underfunding, the citys pension payment, which is $557 million for 2015, is expected to more than double next year. Neither candidate has laid out a solution that doesnt involve action by the General Assembly, which is not assured. Emanuels finance department said it will not put the expected $600 million pension increase on short-term credit. But having hundreds of millions of dollars in credit available to cover other city costs could help free up room in the budget for pension costs, said Richard Ciccarone, president and CEO of the municipal bond analysis firm Merritt Research Services. \"The city is between a rock and a hard place,\" he said. \"Theyve got to have the flexibility to deal with the many issues in front of them, including the requirement to come up with the money and the pressure to not raise taxes.\", hgillers@tribpub.com, hdardick@tribpub.com, Twitter @hgillers, Twitter @reporterhal]", "Date": "20150327", "Title": "[ Emanuel uses borrowing to cope with Daley's debt burden]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com//news/local/ct-chicago-borrowing-emanuel-met-20150327-story.html\n", "Author": "[Heather Gillers, Hal Dardick]"}
{"Content": "[WASHINGTON -- The recent series of events involving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus speech to the U.S. Congress, his election-eve disavowal of a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israel dilemma and his subsequent election backtracking on it have brought a new low to U.S.-Israeli relations. They have produced an uncommon rebuke from President Obama of Netanyahu as an instrument of the disintegration of that longtime objective to achieve peace between the Palestinians and Israelis. They have also dealt a blow to the historic and solid alliance between the United States and Israel. The American presidents celebrated coolness was tested in his latest news conference with visiting Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, but not over anything involving the visitor. Rather, the White House session was dominated by reporters questions to Obama about how Netanyahus behavior would affect the U.S. relationship with Israel, and the state of Palestinian peace talks. The president harshly said that Netanyahus temporary abandonment of the two-state solution, by saying it would not happen on his watch, would require a re-evaluation of \"how we manage Israeli-Palestinian relations over the next few years.\" The prime ministers glaring flip-flop to gain the votes of security-minded Israelis was credited with enabling him to survive his re-election challenge. Obama went on to say the outlook for a successful outcome in the peace talks \"seems very dim\" in light of Netanyahus original comment. The president he took the prime minister \"at his word that thats what he meant\" on blocking a Palestinian state, adding, \"I think that a lot of voters inside of Israel understood him to be saying that unequivocally.\", Obama pointedly noted that Netanyahu \"didnt say never, but there would be a series of conditions when a Palestinian state could potentially be created,\" and \"of course the conditions were such that they would be impossible to meet anytime soon.\", He continued: \"So even if you accepted, I think, the corrective of Prime Minister Netanyahu in subsequent days, there still does not appear to be a prospect of a meaningful framework established that would lead to a Palestinian state.\", Obamas use of \"corrective\" was a diplomatic way of saying the prime minister had welshed on his commitment to a two-state solution. The president also suggested that Netanyahus off-again, on-gain observations on the matter could set off \"a reaction by the Palestinians that, in turn, could elicit a counter-reaction by the Israelis\" and \"end up leading to a downward spiral of relations\" that would turn out to be \"bad for everybody.\", Before all this, the personal relationship between Obama and Netanyahu never seemed to be a cordial one, and the president described it a \"very businesslike.\" But the prime ministers speech to Congress undercutting Obamas nuclear weapons deal with Iran clearly rankled the White House. In the press conference, Obama dismissed the idea that atmospherics was the problem. \"The notion is, well, if wed all just get along, everybody cools down, then somehow the problem goes away,\" he said. He still believed the two-state solution was the best way to go, he said, and \"Prime Minister Netanyahu has a different approach, and so this cant be reduced to a matter of somehow, lets all hold hands and sing Kumbaya. \", At the same time, the president went out of his way to note that in re-evaluating the relationship between their two countries, \"it is not in reference to our commitment to Israels military edge in the region, Israels security, our intelligence cooperation, our military cooperation. That continues unabated. ... Thats not going to stop.\", But Netanyahu ought to be having some second thoughts about his decision to hijack Congress and take on Obama against the pending nuclear deal with Iran. His further willingness to scuttle the long-term effort of both Democratic and Republican administrations to bring peace between Palestinians and Israelis for domestic political purpose goes beyond the pale. In the 67 years after the United States first formally recognized the creation of the state of Israel, the ties between the two democracies has grown ever stronger. The current difficulties will pass, but maybe not before the current prime minister leaves the leadership he connived so calculatedly to retain.

{"Content": "[Now that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has thrown his cowboy hat into the ring for president, its time to start handicapping the candidates, even if some of us may wish we had more choices. Thats OK, my fellow Americans. You vote for  or against  the choices you have. Do you hear me, progressive-wing Democrats begging Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to challenge Hillary Clinton?, Clinton, who hasnt run for office since 2008, could use the competition to sharpen her pitch. But nobody on the left appears to be ready, viable or well-funded enough to take her on. So lets focus on the elephants, whose herd of presidential wannabes seems to grow larger by the day. In the past, I have predicted yet another \"Bush versus Clinton\" race in 2016, as in Jeb versus Hillary. Im sticking to that prediction. I also caution that eight years ago at this time I, like many others, was predicting a Hillary Clinton vs. Rudy Giuliani ballot. Thats why I am not going to rule out any dark horse. The unpredictability of the American voter reigns supreme, reassuring us all that big money, strategists and spin doctors have not completely taken over the process. With that in mind, Cruz is noteworthy for setting the terms of debate within the Republican Party as it tries to return to the White House after eight years out of office  and after losing the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections. To paraphrase a popular song, Cruz is all about that base  the Grand Old Partys conservative base. In announcing his campaign at Liberty University, founded by the late Rev. Jerry Falwell, who was a leader in the rise of the religious right as a political force in the 1980s, Cruz declared his own war against the \"mushy middle.\" Thats his shot at the pragmatic conservatives who favor former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whose record only looks moderate next to hard-liners like Cruz. Of course, what Cruz denounces as the \"mushy middle\" is what most people would call a \"winning majority.\", By setting his kickoff at Liberty University, Cruz surprised many Republicans because he had not previously presented himself as a social or religious conservative like Mike Huckabee or Rick Santorum. Even Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, our most conservative presidents in modern times, left room for themselves to tack back toward the middle after their nominations to appeal to moderate swing voters. Instead of reaching out toward the political middle, Cruz is digging in with the far right. To compete with the well-funded business and country club establishment that boosted John McCain and Mitt Romney and now favors pragmatists like Bush or Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Cruz appears to be turning to the populist foot soldiers of the tea party and religious right. They will turn out to knock on doors, work telephones and raise millions through lots of small donations. Yet despite all the hoopla that has been raised by Cruzs announcement, it has an aroma of desperation about it. His polling numbers have slumped, and resentments are rising among many of his fellow Republicans about his grandstanding. A Quinnipiac University poll in late February of likely Iowa Republican caucus participants put Walker ahead of the pack with 25 percent, about twice as high as his nearest rival, Rand Paul, who had 13 percent support. Close on Pauls heels was physician Ben Carson and Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, with 11 percent each, and Jeb Bush with 10 percent. Only 5 percent of respondents favored Cruz. Cruzs popularity may have peaked during his filibuster and revolt against the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, more widely known as Obamacare. He boasts about his bold stands but is much less eager to bring up how little his grandstanding accomplished, except for a 16-day government shutdown. With that in mind, Cruzs rivals already are murmuring that a vote for Cruz is a vote for Hillary Clinton. For GOP voters who miss having one of their own in the White House, an old question returns: Do you want to make a point or elect a president?, Clarence Page, a member of the Tribune Editorial Board, blogs at chicagotribune.com/pagespage. \"Culture Worrier,\" a collection of his best columns, is available in print and at chicagotribune.com/ebooks. cpage@tribpub.com, Twitter @cptime]", "Date": "20150327", "Title": "[Ted Cruz is all about that base]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com//news/opinion/page/ct-ted-cruz-page-perspec-0325-20150327-column.html\n", "Author": "[Clarence Page]"}
{"Content": "[Like a suitcase on the worlds longest luggage carousel, Hillary Clintons all-but-assured presidential candidacy is now drifting back toward us, begging to be claimed whether or not we still want  or even remember  what is packed inside. Oh, right. Dirty laundry. Some of it dating back decades. And much of it so stained it damages everything it touches. Though Bill Clinton may represent the gold standard in political scandals, Hillary Clinton was getting into trouble as early as her husbands first presidential run in 1992. That was the year she found herself in hot water with country music fans by responding to a question about her husbands alleged infidelity by saying, Im not sitting here as some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette. Clinton later apologized to Wynette, just as she had to atone for another campaign trail quip  I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was fulfill my profession  by entering a cookie recipe in a Family Circle magazine sponsored bake-off. Youd think shed have learned her lesson, but once the Clintons got to the White House, she managed to knock out tempests in various-sized teapots as readily as Wynette knocked out singles in the late 1960s. If you were a sentient being during the Clinton presidency, surely you remember some of the greatest hits from the repertoire of scandals, many of which were perceived as bugaboos of a Hillary-specific nature. There was Whitewater and Travelgate and all that business about her talking to Eleanor Roosevelt through psychics. There was Clintons insistence that the Monica Lewinsky story and Kenneth Starr investigation were products of a vast right-wing conspiracy. Then theres Hillary Clintons Greatest Scandals, Volume Two, which starts, arguably, with her magic carpet ride to New York, where she set up camp in order to run for Senate, and ends with the modern classic of Clintonian scandals, Benghazi. But of course thats not the end. Now that its come out that Clinton used a private server for official work emails during her time at the State Department, we have (yes, its really being called this) email-ghazi. Even as Clinton explained herself at a news conference, insisting that all relevant messages were saved and turned over to the State Department when she left her post as secretary, Republicans were crying foul. I dont know about you, but given that Clinton is a 67-year-old grandmother, Im just impressed that shes not still using AOL. Over the years, Clinton has been likened to any number of cultural (and often female) archetypes: the schoolmarm, the shrew, the doormat, the ambition-soaked megalomaniac. But as the prospect of another presidential bid inches ever closer on that luggage carousel, its increasingly clear that the role she returns to most often is that of a partner in an abusive relationship. In her case, a relationship with the public. No matter how hard Clinton gets knocked down in the press and in the polls, she stays with us. No matter how badly her would-be supporters treated her in the past by switching their allegiances to Barack Obama (or, today, by flirting with Elizabeth Warren), she still wants our approval  particularly the ne plus ultra of our approval, which would be election to highest office in the land. Of course, true to form, Clinton is an equal partner in this abusive dynamic. To many of her longtime supporters, her hawkishness and unapologetic embrace of Washington business-as-usual has felt at times like a right cross to the left cheek. That so many have nonetheless hung in with her  her unspoken campaign slogan sometimes seems akin to Hillary: Weve Waited This Long, So Why Give Up Now?  suggests that Clinton takes a perverse pleasure in all the abuse. Otherwise, why wouldnt she have just used common sense along with email at State?, Maybe because she already knows something that most commanders in chief dont find out until they reach office. She knows that the relationship between the president of the United States and the citizens of the United States is largely an abusive one, or at least a tortured one. Full of empty promises on one side and constant dissatisfaction on the other, youd have to be a glutton for punishment to venture into it at all. Which is why Clinton, that ever-hopeful suitcase, may be perfect for the job. No matter how roughly shes handled, shes still waiting patiently for us to claim her. mdaum@latimescolumnists.com, Twitter @meghan_daum]", "Date": "20150327", "Title": "[Why we are sorting through the Clintons' dirty laundry]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com//news/opinion/commentary/chi-hillary-clinton-bill-dirty-laundry-20150319-column.html\n", "Author": "[Meghan Daum]"}
{"Content": "[Rahm Emanuel and Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia clashed in an argumentative second debate Thursday night, a face-to-face meeting in which the challenger tried to put the mayor on the defensive by mocking his leadership of Chicago. With early voting underway ahead of the April 7 election, Emanuel tried to counter Garcias aggressiveness by warning that the challengers lack of a financial game plan for the city would lead to \"red ink\" and a loss of companies and jobs. The hour-long debate, held at the downtown studios of WFLD-Ch. 32, found both candidates frequently talking over each other as they were asked about the serious financial challenges facing both City Hall and Chicago Public Schools. , Several times, Garcia laughed and smiled as he ridiculed Emanuels positions as an example of failed leadership. When the mayor talked about closing a coal-fired plant in Little Village, where Garcia lives, the challenger responded: \"You singlehandedly closed that? People have been working on that for 10 years. You were still in Washington.\", At another point, Garcia was asked about his opposition to the use of lakefront land between Soldier Field and McCormick Place for a museum to display the collections of movie mogul and \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas. The challenger accused Emanuel of deciding to award the land for \"a monument to Darth Vader\" through mayoral \"fiat.\", \"Youre not the king of the city,\" said Garcia, who added, \"If you want to put it there, ask the voters.\", But Emanuel countered, saying Garcias vacillating over the use of city parkland for a proposed Barack Obama presidential library was emblematic of the problem in the Cook County commissioners governing style. Emanuel, who served as Obamas first White House chief of staff, said he has been \"clear and consistent\" on bringing the Obama library to the presidents hometown against competing bids from institutions in New York and Hawaii. Emanuel said he showed what business leaders are looking for from a mayor. \"They bet on leadership thats consistent, and if youre not consistent, you can put all those economic gains and jobs at risk,\" Emanuel said. Garcia said he always supported bringing the Obama library to Chicago, and when it was clear that parkland would be necessary, the challenger said he backed the decision. The challenger criticized Emanuel as more invested in the citys downtown business district than in the outlying neighborhoods. Emanuel said bringing new businesses and jobs to the downtown \"gives us the resources to invest in the neighborhoods.\", On another front, Garcia criticized Emanuel for closing 50 schools and a half-dozen mental health centers which the challenger said provided \"another clear example of bad choices being made by a mayor who does not understand the impact of the policy decisions.\", \"Im saying that the mayor doesnt listen to people. He doesnt get around to the neighborhoods. He doesnt address people in a natural fashion,\" said Garcia, who added that he had \"neighborhood networks and relationships.\", CPS faces a $1.1 billion deficit, and negotiations on a new teacher contract are underway. Emanuel said he was confident that he could find a budget resolution to avoid a repeat of the teachers strike that happened in his first term. \"Were going to work through all those issues. We shouldnt be distracted from our priority, our children,\" said Emanuel, who added that kids \"dont get a do-over\" on education. Emanuel said three-quarters of the citys schools money shortfall involves teacher pensions. He reiterated that city residents should not be forced to pay for CPS pensions through property taxes and also pay teacher pensions for districts outside Chicago through state income taxes. Chicago taxpayers \"are not an ATM for teachers in Naperville, Schaumburg,\" Emanuel said. Garcia contended that the citys schools under Emanuel were riddled with conflicts of interest. \"Once we have audited what will be there, well have to go to the legislature to see how much money we can get to balance the budget,\" Garcia said. Garcia, who is receiving major financial backing from teachers unions, acknowledged \"difficult decisions, hard decisions are going to be made,\" but said they would be done without the \"issue of animosity\" Emanuel had created with unionized teachers. In his closing statement, Garcia referred to Emanuels first TV ad of the runoff in which the mayor acknowledged his style can turn voters off. \"The mayor said that sometimes he rubs people the wrong way because of his passion, but thats not why people on Feb. 24 voted for change in the city of Chicago,\" said Garcia, alluding to Emanuel failing to win re-election outright last month. \"They voted for change, because theyre tired of the broken promises, theyre tired of the bad choices and theyre tired of the wrong priorities of this administration.  I will be a mayor that will be inclusive.\", In a reflection of how the Emanuel camp viewed his performance, the mayor made a rare visit to the post-debate spin room, where he said of Garcia: \"Attacking somebody is not an attack on the challenges facing the city of Chicago.\", While Emanuel didnt go on the offensive much during the debate, he did afterward. The mayor criticized Garcia for only recently coming around to the mayors idea of backing an expanded state sales tax on services to shore up the citys finances. \"Hes now come over and supported my position,\" Emanuel said. \"Leadership requires being concise, consistent and steady.  If you dont know where you stand, nobody else knows where you stand and you cannot get the job done.\", The debate culminated a day in which Karen Lewis, the Chicago Teachers Union president and the person behind Garcias candidacy, made her first public appearance with him before the runoff election. \"I am shocked at how people have responded to the stache,\" Lewis said as she sat a table with Garcia and sipped raspberry iced tea at Pearls Place Restaurant in Bronzeville. But in a conversation in which Lewis complimented Garcia on his TV ads by saying \"commercials alone make a difference in many ways,\" the challenger acknowledged the need for more money to keep his message on the air. About the same time, Emanuel looked to shore up support among black voters by joining a luncheon with Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White and African-American ministers. Emanuel said he was working to avoid the need for city property tax increases while Garcia has not taken \"any reforms off the table\" in pitching a post-election task force to recommend budget fixes. Before the debate, roughly 200 CPS teachers rallied outside the Thompson Center after union leaders submitted a lengthy set of labor contract demands to schools officials. Among them: diverting tax-increment financing revenues into schools, freezing charter school expansion and suing banks over some of the districts financing agreements. CTU has not yet submitted its expectations for future wages and benefits. Union Vice President Jesse Sharkey said whoever wins the mayoral election will have to confront teacher demands and a dire CPS financial picture. \"The political choice that the city is grappling with, about whos going to become mayor, winds up tying into the question of what kind of schools we can afford,\" Sharkey said. The final broadcast debate of the runoff campaign is scheduled for 7 p.m. Tuesday, one week from Election Day. It will be on WTTW Ch.-11.

{"Content": "[Mokena voters will elect three village trustees in the April 7 election, choosing from a field of six that includes three incumbents and three new but somewhat familiar faces. Seeking re-election are trustees Don Labriola, running for a fourth term; Debbie Engler, seeking a third term, and James M. Richmond, trying for a second term. But the three are not running together. Engler, Richmond and Joseph Budzyn, chairman of Mokenas police and fire commission since 1994, make up the Friends of Mokena slate. Theyre opposed by the Mokena Vision Party candidates  Labriola, retired village employee Marietta Kafka Glass and businesswoman Debbie Fox. All said they are independent candidates who are running together because they share similar views and ideas  and because its more economical. \"We are concerned about the whole community,\" said Engler, 57, a 24-year resident of the village and an administrative assistant for a national industrial parts distributor. \"Things are going so well in Mokena. We want to continue to be fiscally sound and keep it on track.\", Mokena withstood rather well the economic recession and managed to increase its sales tax revenue  bringing in a Meijer store, one of 64 new businesses that opened in 2014, The Friends of Mokena candidates said. They said the village has the lowest municipal property tax rate of 23 surrounding communities, decreased its debt and earned a AA+ bond rating, which saves money on interest rates. They plan to focus on core services while being pro-growth and fiscally conservative, the three said, and touted their varied backgrounds and skills. They also have been active volunteers in Scouting and the chamber of commerce. Engler was chamber president in 2005 and president of the Lincolnway Area Business Womans Organization for eight years. She also ran Mokenas French Market for eight years. Budzyn, 60, is a retired federal agent and volunteer admissions liaison officer for the U.S. Air Force Academy. A 37-year resident, he served two years as village trustee in 1983-84 and has been a member of the police and fire commission since 1991. \"Voters need to look at the skills we bring,\" he said. \"We have managed people and managed projects. We can reach consensus and provide customer service.\", Richmond, 54, a 15-year resident, served four years on the Mokena Park District board before being elected to the village board in 2011. He has 25 years in information technology, was a director of a Fortune 400 company and owns his own business. He said he wants Mokena to be \"developer-friendly\" as well as \"community-friendly.\", \"We want to bring in development that will make the community better,\" he said. Richmond said hes a fiscal conservative who wants to limit spending, conserve resources and prepare the village well for the next generation. \"As trustees we have to look at the bigger picture,\" Budzyn said. \"We three know that time is money. We do not want to waste citizens and developers time.\", The three candidates cited as areas ripe for business growth U.S. 30 and Wolf Road and 191st Street and LaGrange Road. They also said they want to see occupied the former Ace Hardware store on LaPorte Road. As for the downtown area, the village plans to demolish a vacant building at McGovney Street and Wolf Road and is looking for a developer \"with a great idea,\" Richmond said, but the village is limited by the Metra tracks there. Economic development also is the focus of the Mokena Vision Party. While the village has had some success in bringing in new businesses, \"you are never finished with economic development. You have to be vigilant about it,\" said Labriola, adding that the village has about 100 vacant storefronts. He said several businessmen have expressed concerns to him about the level of business growth in Mokena and are supporting the party slate. \"They are not happy with the pace. They feel things could be run more efficiently,\" he said. Labriola said he, Fox and Glass believe the village board has not pushed hard enough for development along Front Street downtown. They propose that the soon-to-be vacant downtown corner be used for a multi-level parking garage to eliminate parking on the south side of Front Street and make room for businesses on both sides of the street. \"We need to bring in smaller businesses, especially on Front Street,\" said Glass, 68, who retired last year after working 15 years with the village and now serves as the part-time assistant executive director of the Mokena Chamber of Commerce. A chamber member for 15 years, she wants the village to hire a full-time economic development director, a position now combined with the community development director. Neighboring towns are overpowering Mokena in terms of economic development, said Fox, a mother of four teenagers whos making her first attempt at public office. As a 14-year business owner in the village, she wants to make Mokena more business-friendly and would welcome all businesses, large and small, she said. The current board \"shoots down everything. Our process takes forever,\" she said. In addition to attracting more businesses, Fox wants to get more residents involved and offer more activities for youth. \"Mokena is broke, and it is time for us to fix it,\" she said. \"I care about what people think. I believe I can make a difference.\", Glass said her 15 years of experience working in the village as a customer service clerk and assistant to the economic development coordinator, coupled with her 15 years on the chamber board, gives her a \"good working knowledge of the village. \"As a resident, I know what I would like to see changed, and the only way is to get on the board,\" she said. During his 12 years as a trustee, Labriola said he opened village board meetings up to public comment and had meetings broadcast live over the Internet. He said he worked to bring lake water to Mokena and is now trying to cap water rates. He was a member of the board that built a new Lincolnway 911 dispatch center and created a task force to increase funding for dispatch centers. slafferty@tribpub.com]", "Date": "20150326", "Title": "[Mokena trustee race centers on economic development]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com//suburbs/daily-southtown/news/ct-sta-mokena-trustee-st-0327-20150326-story.html\n", "Author": "[Susan DeMar Lafferty]"}
{"Content": "[Chris Trzeciaks seemingly ordinary decision to file as a candidate for Evergreen Park trustee was anything but ordinary. Turns out that he created a rare situation in the village  its first contested race for the village board since 1987. Thats not a misprint. There are four candidates seeking three four-year seats. The other three have more years on the board collectively than Trzeciak, 28, has been alive. But hes confident of winning. Trzeciak was 20 when he was elected to the Evergreen Park High School District 231 board and is now board president. \"I think it worked out pretty well,\" he said of his service on the school board. His term on the board expires this year, and hes not seeking re-election. So on April 7, its the village board or nothing for Trzeciak. And thats OK with Trzeciak, who said hes running because he thinks its time for the village board \"to have a younger person.\", Trustees Mark Marzullo, 57, Jim McQuillan, 55, and Mary Keane, 52, said they dont mind the competition but think their experience is invaluable. The three are running together on the United Homeowners Party slate. When asked why it has been nearly 30 years between contested races, Marzullo offered that \"maybe when youre doing a good job, people recognize it.\", McQuillan and Keane also subscribe to the \"if it aint broke, dont fix it\" philosophy. \"I dont consider myself old,\" McQuillan said. \"As far as getting younger people involved, Id agree with him if the town was stale, but were far from being stale.\", McQuillan noted the villages impressive run of attracting major retailers such as Meijer, Menards and Marianos in the past few years. And hes pleased, as are all the candidates, about the recent announcement of a plan to demolish The Plaza, the all-but-vacant indoor mall at 95th Street and Western Avenue, and replacing it with a smaller open-air mall. The incumbents spoke highly of the leadership provided by longtime Mayor Jim Sexton, with whom theyre closely aligned politically. Sexton is not up for re-election this year and is back running the village after a near-fatal bout with West Nile Virus. The three said Sexton is one reason they enjoy being on the village board. \"Hes the quarterback, and were running some great plays,\" Marzullo said. \"Some say were his puppets, thats totally untrue. We have our disagreements. We talk things out because were all here for the good of Evergreen Park. We put politics aside, and we get things done that way.\", Trzeciak appreciates their efforts, adding that \"if I didnt think Evergreen Park was a good community, I would not live here.\" He and his wife are expecting their first baby this year. But he thinks more can be done to improve the village. Hed like to see an indoor athletic center, but the others arent sure thats a good idea. Trzeciak didnt offer any cost estimate for such a center, but Marzullo said its not the right time to build something that may prove costly and would eat up valuable green space in the land-locked village. Trzeciak said he approves of plans to redevelop The Plaza but hopes for more higher-end stores. So do the other candidates. \"Ive heard Whole Foods mentioned for that site, but Id want to look at what effect that may have on Marianos, which just opened on 95th Street, \" Trzeciak said. \"We need to bring the right businesses in here. I want to make sure we dont create a hyper-competitive situation.\", Trzeciak believes that eight years on the school board has prepared him well for dealing with village issues, noting that he has been through two teacher contract negotiations \"with positive outcomes.\", Marzullo, who owns a supply company, said he appreciates Trzeciak running for office but thinks it would be better for him to serve on a village commission or two to learn more about the village government. McQuillan, 55, owns a heating and cooling company with his brother. He bought the company when he was 18 and a senior at Brother Rice High School. McQuillan cited Evergreen Parks business growth in recent years as a big reason to return the incumbents to the board. \"For businesses to open up their pocketbooks and come to our town, theyve got to feel strong about our community,\" he said. \"It starts from the top. We have a lower crime rate, and were on the border of the city (Chicago). Our tax structure is a little lower than the city, which helps, but it all starts with Mayor Sexton and works its way down.\", Keane, a volunteer coordinator for Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, said the 28-year run of non-contested village board races is a direct reflection of the job done by trustees over the years. \"Our races are never contested, and theres low voter turnout because people are pretty happy with the way things are happening here,\" she said. \"Like any other community, residents dont want their taxes to go any higher. We combat that by bringing in new businesses that bring us more tax revenue. I think our residents are pretty happy.\", If re-elected, Keane hopes to create a flying disc golf tournament at the village park that used to be part of the Evergreen Country Club golf course. Part of that land was used to bring in the Meijer store and other retailers. \"The beauty of our administration is that all six (trustees) represent our entire community,\" she said. \"Were not broken up into districts, and we dont fight for one area or another. We focus on Evergreen Park.\", Asked about the need for youth on the board, she replied, \"we have a young person on the board, me. As a matter of fact, according to the 2010 Census, I represent the largest age group in our community.\"]", "Date": "20150326", "Title": "[A rarity in Evergreen Park  political competition]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com//suburbs/daily-southtown/news/ct-sta-evergreen-trustees-race-st-0327-20150326-story.html\n", "Author": "[Steve Metsch]"}
{"Content": "[Cart before the horse, The Antioch Village Board has no idea what to do. First they get rid of an operating rescue squad and then have no money to fund a new one  e.g. cart before the horse.

Try getting the priorities in order for once at least. So far, under the leadership of the mayor, things have been going downhill fast with fees and taxes going up. Transfer funds, I will preface my remark by saying the Waukegan Park District does an outstanding job in Waukegan. Given that, with the city being in budget deficits for basic services, currently and in the past, would it not be wise to divert some funds, temporarily, from the Park District to the city treasury, since both are derived from real estate taxes? The park district has excess funds, as is evidenced by the past construction of the sports complex and the field house without an additional tax levy. The referendum to support those capital investments was passed in 1997 and is still applying taxes to our real estate bills today. Just wondering. We hate the mans policies, In reference to the article about irrational people who hate President Obama. We dont hate Obama, we hate his policies.

Too much snow, In response to the comments in the TOTC about the people that dont shovel their sidewalks. Leave these quiet tax-paying citizens alone.

Violation of HIPAA laws, Im not sure what the HIPAA requirements are but I do know that I get a copy of it after every doctor visit. Recently, I was at the Vista emergency room in Waukegan and the only privacy they provide is a small cotton curtain between each stall. When people enter the stall, theyre asked questions and you can hear their name, birth date, symptoms and what theyre being treated for. I would think that would be a violation of the HIPAA laws.

{"Content": "[Selecting a new superintendent, dealing with the potential loss of state funding and negotiating a new teachers contract are some of the issues facing candidates for the Community School District 99 school board. Four candidates are vying for three four-year terms on the seven-member board in the district that has two high schools: Downers Grove North and Downers Grove South.The candidates are Nancy Kupka of Woodridge and Donald Renner, Keith Matune and Michael Davenport, all of Downers Grove. The election is April 7. A new board will have the task of replacing Superintendent Mark McDonald, who will retire at the end of the 2015-2016 school year after 14 years with the district. \"Our current superintendent has been a good manager and given us good guidance. Wed be looking for someone similar and a good communicator,\" said Davenport, 49,, who has served on the volunteer board the past four years. The district is in the process of hiring a search firm to help them find candidates for the superintendent post, he said. Renner, 36, who serves on the board of the District 99 Education Foundation, is the only non-incumbent trying to win a board spot. Renner said there should be public meetings and other ways to get community input on filling the role of superintendent. \"The district could facilitate an online forum for residents to voice their opinions and concerns with the search for a superintendent, and the board could host a town hall meeting if there is interest from the community to discuss the search,\" he said. Besides hiring a superintendent, Kupka, 58, the board president, said the greatest issue the district faces is how to maintain an excellent education while dealing with the possibility that the state might require school districts to take on the burden of funding teachers pensions. \"We have a lot of big issues facing us,\" she said. \"The most important (issue) is the great unknown. Are pensions going to come back to the district? Are there going to (be state) cuts to the schools?\", Kupka said the district might have to look for ways to save money. \"Were going to have scrimp and save somewhere,\" Kupka said. Kupka said a new board will need to work with the superintendent and business manager to identify what costs could be cut. Matune, 45, is another of the three incumbents seeking to return to the board. He said the new board should consider needs as opposed to wants as it makes financial decisions. \"We should make long- and short-term plans and then determine want versus need with input from all stakeholders,\" said Matune, who is a licensed teacher, in an email. Davenport said he wants keep a lid on student fees. He supported issuing Chromebooks to all students next school year, but opposed charging fees for them. It will cost parents about $100 a year per device. \"I dont think public education ought to come with a tuition,\" he said. Like all the other candidates, Renner said hes worried about possible losses of state funding to the district, but his work as an attorney for a Chicago firm that includes school law as one of its specialties would be helpful to the district. \"Im familiar with school finance issues, and I think thats something unique I will bring to the board,\" he said. Renner said that expertise also will be useful in collective bargaining. The current contract for the districts 324 teachers expires in 2016. The average teachers salary in the district is $89,652, according to the district website. Matune said it bothers him that all of the other candidates  Kupka, Davenport and Renner  have received support in the form of yard signs from the Downers Grove Education Association, which represents the teachers. \"In my opinion, it represents a severe conflict of interest and lack of judgment on the part of the DGEA (teachers union) by outwardly supporting candidates who will in turn be voting on their contract within the next year,\" he wrote in an email. Matunes opponents said they have no control over whether the association wanted to purchase yard signs for them. Both Davenport and Kupka said the associations support will not affect any decisions they might make that affect teachers, including a new contract. \"The teachers union has taken it upon themselves to print up signs, but they arent giving me any money,\" said Kupka, adding that she would not accept any money from the association. Renner did not respond to an emailed question about the yard signs. As a final issue, Davenport said hes concerned about the condition of district facilities. He said neither high school is fully air conditioned, and the districts office also is in need of work. \"Its practically embarrassing the way its set up now,\" he said. The district is in the process of developing a master facilities plan to help guide any changes or upgrades to facilities, he said. Davenport and wife Shelly have four children, Wesley, 17, Abby, 15, Andrea, 13, and Mary, 12. Matune and wife Dawn also have four children, Drew, 10, Quin, 8, Megan, 4 and Bryce, 4. Renner and wife Heidi are parents of three children, Hannah, 7, Rebecca, 4, and Caroline, 2. Kupka is a single mother of two daughters, Zoe, 18 and Adien, 14. District 99 has 5,055 students and serves Downers Grove, Bolingbrook, Woodridge, Darien, Lisle, Oak Brook, Westmont and Woodridge. amannion@tribpub.com]", "Date": "20150326", "Title": "[District 99 candidates say new superintendent top priority]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com//suburbs/downers-grove/news/ct-dgr-district-99-election-downersgrove-tl-0402-20150326-story.html\n", "Author": "[Annemarie Mannion]"}
{"Content": "[Five people likely to become leaders soon in Elgin-area politics and volunteerism gathered Tuesday with eight teenagers for a bowling and pizza party. The parties organizers were among the 2014-2015 class members of Elgin Area Leadership Academy, a group that the Elgin Area Chamber of Commerce assembles every two years to train how to be an Elgin-area leader. The kids attending were participants in the Boys and Girls Club of Elgins after-school activities held at the two Elgin high schools and four Elgin middle schools. Chamber of Commerce President Carol Gieske said this years Leadership Academy class numbers 23 people. Their class activities included viewing a play put on by Elgin Community College students that explored the social and political aspects of the deadly 1995 Chicago heat wave. The group will graduate in May. But before then, Gieske said, each member is required to participate in some kind of team service project. Toya Webb, one of the academy students, said that as they discussed possible projects, she and four other students realized they were \"passionate about working to empower youth.\" So they decided to hold what they called the \"Spring Break Bowling Bash\" at Elgin Lanes to reward some of the Boys and Girls Clubs top-performing kids and to do some one-on-one mentoring with them. Webb is a certified life coach and works in the community relations department at Elgin Community College. Other Bowling Bash organizers included Arisleyda Taylor, an international logistics planner who already is running for the School District U46 Board in the April 7 election; Raquel Robelo, an administrative assistant in District U46s early-learning office who also is president of Lords Park Schools parent-teacher organization; Aliana Aquino, the human resources and payroll coordinator at the Petroliance fuel dealership in Elgin; and Theresa Higaredo, a part-time case manager at the Elgin PADS shelter who does substance-abuse counseling with homeless people. \"I want to work with families, especially within the Hispanic community, and get them more involved in their childrens education,\" Robelo said. For their service project, a second team of Leadership Academy students is preparing a checklist of requirements and resources for anyone who wants to start a new business in Elgin. A third team is preparing a list of opportunities for teenagers and young adults to volunteer for good causes in and around Elgin. Once those lists are completed, Webb said, both will be posted on the chamber of commerces website, elginchamber.com. But as the eight Boys and Girls Club honorees arrived at Elgin Lanes aboard a minibus Tuesday, the first teams effort was more hands-on. The kids and academy people joined in to gobble up several pizzas that had been donated by Nicks Pizza. Then they began rolling black balls toward white pins. The teens and the organizers alike rolled lots of gutter balls. A more seasoned adult bowler at the alley next door used his wicked hook shot to score strikes and spares in nearly every frame, amassing a final score of 224 in his first game. Half of the bash bowlers had not yet scored 20 by halfway through their first game. But the bash was great fun anyway, agreed Ellis Middle School students Jose Perez and Jose Ramirez. Perez said that when he grows up, he hopes to become a forensic pathologist and help solve crimes by analyzing blood splatters and DNA. One of the adults talked to him about having interviewed the pathologist who used to do most of the autopsies at the Kane County Morgue, and some of the real-life mystery deaths that man has explained. Ramirez said he also has a scientific bent and hopes to become a medical doctor, because \"I like to take care of people.\", Sarah Cranmer, director of teen services for the Boys and Girls Club, said the Bowling Bash participants were chosen because of their good grades and good behavior. She said the clubs six after-school sites offer kids homework help plus learning and recreation activities. Some of these kids could become the leadership academys students of tomorrow and the community leaders of the day after that. \"We talk with the kids about the importance of volunteering in your community and being a positive role model for your peers and for kids younger than you,\" Cranmer said. The leadership academy has graduated about 450 people since it started in the early 1990s under the leadership of Dan Fox, Don Waters and Ruth Munson. The chambers Gieske said this years students \"will get lots of calls from the nonprofit organizations. Theyre already calling us and asking, Have the leadership academy students graduated yet?\", DGathman@tribpub.com]", "Date": "20150325", "Title": "[Future Elgin leaders invite high-achieving teens to a bowling bash]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com//suburbs/elgin-courier-news/news/ct-ecn-bowling-st-0326-20150325-story.html\n", "Author": "[Dave Gathman]"}
{"Content": "[Hundreds of civilians, including many children, have been abducted and are being used as human shields by Boko Haram extremists, a top Nigerian official confirmed Wednesday. The news of the mass kidnappings comes as Nigeria prepares for crucial elections on Saturday. Several hundred people were taken captive by the Islamic militants as they retreated earlier this month from Damasak in northeastern Nigeria, Mike Omeri, the Nigerian spokesman for the fight against Boko Haram, told The Associated Press Wednesday. He said he could not specify how many were taken captive but local reports say as many as 500 people were seized. When troops from Chad and Niger advanced toward Damasak, Boko Haram began taking captives, said Omeri, speaking in Nigerias capital, Abuja. \"Boko Haram ... rushed to primary schools they took children and adults that they are using as shields to protect themselves from the menacing advance of troops,\" said Omeri. \"They are being used as shields by Boko Haram.\", Damasak, near the border with Niger, was recaptured from Boko Haram on March 16. The kidnappings of civilians has only been confirmed now. The soldiers who recaptured Damasak found the town largely deserted. Damasak had been held for months by Boko Haram, who used the trading town as an administrative center. The troops from Chad and Niger who now hold Damasak have discovered evidence of a mass grave, Chads ambassador to the U.N. Mahamat Zene Cherif confirmed Wednesday. Almost a year ago some 276 girls were kidnapped before dawn from a government boarding school in Chibok. Dozens escaped in the first couple of days, but 219 remain missing. The case of the missing schoolgirls has gained widespread international attention and spawned the #BringBackOurGirls campaign on social media. Nigerias battle against the Islamic extremists is a major issue for the elections to be held Saturday. The 6-year-old Islamic insurgency has killed thousands, including an estimated 10,000 last year. Boko Haram has vowed to violently disrupt the elections. International assistance desperately is needed for the thousands of Nigerian refugees who have fled the violence, the head of the U.N. refugee agency said Wednesday as he visited a camp in Cameroon. Violence in Nigeria has forced more than 192,000 people to flee to the neighboring countries of Cameroon, Chad and Niger. But the U.N. refugee agency says the crisis hasnt drawn sufficient international support, calling it one of the most underfunded emergencies in the world. At Cameroons Minawao refugee camp, residents arent getting enough to eat or drink, and there arent enough toilets or medical supplies, Isaac Luka, a representative of the refugees, said Wednesday. U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said the agency will funnel more resources to Cameroon, but he noted that they have only received 3 percent of the funding necessary to run Minawao, which is home to 33,000 people. \"Every country in the world needs to understand that Cameroon is not only protecting itself, Cameroon is protecting all of us,\" he said.

{"Content": "[Voters in Warrenville and parts of unincorporated Wheaton and Naperville will go to the polls April 7 to decide if they want to choose the three members of the Warrenville Fire Protection District board directly through elections or if they want the DuPage County Board chairman to continue to appoint them. Warrenvilles fire district serves almost the entire city, along with a swath of unincorporated areas extending from just east of the Chicago Golf Club in unincorporated Wheaton to a portion of Fermilab on the west. On the north, district boundaries extend from Mack Road to south of Interstate Highway 88 on the south. It also takes in small pieces of unincorporated Naperville, including Fairmeadow Lane, Delles Road and 39th Street west of Naperville Road, and Meadow and Sunrise Roads south of Ferry Road. Now, DuPage County Board Chairman Dan Cronin selects trustees, subject to that boards consent. He has been pushing the countys many fire districts to either consolidate or share services in an effort to be more efficient. The effort has been part of what Cronin calls his ACT initiative, which seeks accountability, transparency and consolidation from local governments. Cronin asked Warrenvilles fire district to join the West Suburban Fire/Rescue Alliance to share services and shorten response times. He also encouraged the district to adopt the countys ethics ordinance and sign an intergovernmental agreement subjecting it to enforcement measures. In response, some residents connected to the fire district gathered enough signatures to place a question on whether district trustees should be chosen by voters or the county board chairman. \"This is the only unit of local government that can make residents pay property taxes, but residents cant vote for or against the people who are making the decisions,\" said former fire district Trustee Kate Perkins, whom Cronin appointed in early 2013 but then declined to reappoint in 2014. \"Thats just not right. The city governments in Warrenville and Wheaton are elected, and the park districts are elected. This decision belongs to the people who live here.\", Perkins and other supporters of direct election of trustees collected more than 1,600 signatures, far exceeding the 1,000 signatures needed to place the measure on the ballot. She disputed Cronins assertions about the local fire alliance. \"Weve got a lot of forest preserve between us and other departments, like Carol Stream and West Chicago,\" Perkins said. \"Instead, weve standardized our operating procedures with Naperville, which is closer to us. If Chairman Cronin doesnt understand the issues going on in Warrenville, hes perhaps not the best person to be appointing (trustees).\", Cronin called the ballot efforts \"disturbing.\", \"This seems like a rather curious move on their part,\" he said. \"This west suburban fire alliance works on shared services, and (alliance officials) actually think it could shorten response times for folks in the Warrenville Fire Protection District, as they have a few fire stations that are closer to residents. Ive put some new people  some reform-minded people  on the board, and some of the old guard who had been there in the past during some of (the districts) experiences with nepotism and some of the insider dealings, those folks are the ones out circulating this petition.\", District Board President Bill Mennell called consolidating services \"a good idea,\" but insisted that working with Naperville makes more sense because \"we have common borders.\" He dismissed Cronins concerns about ethics, noting the district has its own ethics policy. \"We didnt sign on with the county because the county would come in and if there were any questions, theyd come in and do the investigation, but they also wanted $150 an hour to do it, and were not opening our checkbook whenever the county comes in,\" Mennell said. \"If they wanted to do it for free or at a reduced price, great.\", Cronin said none of the 12 other local governments that have signed on to the countys ethics ordinance has expressed concerns over investigation costs. He added that he believes \"in democracy with a small d and if folks want to take a vote on whether to elect their fire district board, thats their prerogative. \"But, I would just ask the voters as they are casting their ballots why,\" he said. \"Why are they doing this? With the appointed model, we were trying to move in a direction of reform and change. Do they not want to change, or do they really want to run another campaign over there, and more literature and more signs?\", Perkins noted that Warrenville is one of just three DuPage County fire districts with appointed board members, along with Lisle-Woodridge and West Chicago. The other dozen or so have their trustees elected by voters. \"The people of Warrenville deserve to have a say in the future of their fire district, and the way for them to have that say is if they elect people who are directly accountable to them,\" she said. Cronin said he has \"no other agenda\" other than seeing local governments with \"enlightened, reform-minded people, and new people who are willing to do shared services.\"]", "Date": "20150325", "Title": "[ How to select fire protection trustees on ballot]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com//suburbs/wheaton/news/ct-wht-warrenville-fire-district-referendum-tl-0326-20150322-story.html\n", "Author": "[Bob Goldsborough]"}
{"Content": "[Stan Lutz doesnt get what the fuss is all about. So what if three state senators boycotted the morning prayer at a recent legislative session because a Hindu cleric delivered the invocation? It was anti-Christian, they argued, to have a Hindu bless the Senate. Or as state Sen. Steve Vick explained to the Spokesman-Review: \"They worship cows.\", Who cares that the Idaho Statesman called the \"prayer snub pitiful\" and the incident pushed the Idaho Press-Tribune to publish an editorial headlined, \"Time to end public prayers in Statehouse\"?, This is Idaho, Lutz noted from his usual post at the Northwest Science Museum, Americas newest tribute to creationism thats only a few miles west of the Capitol dome where Rajan Zed got the cold shoulder. On March 3, the Universal Society of Hinduism president prayed to the \"deity supreme\" that Idahos elected officials \"may long together dwell in unity and concord.\", \"I think, if it was me, I would have boycotted it too,\" said Lutz, a 62-year-old retired farmer and museum cofounder. \"I like the culture of Idaho. Politically, I think its more conservative, for the most part.\", Conservative enough that the Kootenai County Republican Central Committee recently considered declaring it a \"Christian state.\" And the Ada County Highway District voted to start public meetings with a prayer  until a few vocal citizens complained that God doesnt have much to do with asphalt. Idaho is conservative enough to embrace the museum that Lutz helped create, an as-yet-modest facility dedicated to the idea that Earth is a mere 6,000 years old. That dinosaurs and men cavorted together. That all those fossils dug up by archaeologists came into being because of the flood. Yes. That flood. The Northwest Science Museums board of directors has big plans here in one of Americas most conservative states  where the population is more than 80% white, the electorate voted for a Republican president in the last seven elections and prayer is top of mind. When the group finally raises the necessary $150 million, its members plan to erect a 350,000-square-foot facility with a full-sized ark that will rise above Interstate 84 somewhere between Boise and Nampa. Lutz and Executive Director Douglas J. Bennett say their museum, which opened in June, is different from the dozen or so others dedicated to Creation Week across the country. Like Chicagos Field Museum of Natural History or the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, its website says, the Northwest Science Museum will focus on natural history  but presented from a biblical point of view and dedicated to the belief \"that creation science can explain the evidence we see in the world around us and that it is not just religion.\", Each exhibit is accompanied by an evolutionary explanation and a biblical explanation, Bennett said, and museum-goers will be able to make up their own minds. \"Because we feel we dont have anything to hide,\" said Bennett, a 54-year-old geologist. \"If we put both out there, a person thats actually seeking the truth will look and say, Ah, the biblical explanation fits what I see in the world around us a lot better than evolution.\", For now, the Northwest Science Museum is housed in a light industrial park hard by Boises auto row in a single room the size of a generous studio apartment. Attendance can range from three or four per week to upward of 100. The museum is a particular draw for home-schoolers and church groups, although the occasional atheist has been known to wander in, along with the simply curious. The center of the fledgling facility is occupied by a Volkswagen-sized skull with soaring tusks. It is a replica of the one that once belonged to the Lone Star Mastodon, which was discovered in a gravel pit near La Grange, Texas, 11 years ago. Fossil-filled cases line the museum walls, displaying slices of petrified wood and nautilus shells, dinosaur eggs and the imprints of ancient leaves. Everything, Bennett says, is about 4,500 years old, \"because they were buried during the flood and fossilized at that time.\", The sauropod egg is of particular importance, he said. Although the cement-colored sphere is the size of a soccer ball, eggs like it produced behemoths that grew to 100 feet long and 100 tons. \"This is the egg that the biggest dinosaur comes from,\" Bennett said during a recent tour of the small facility. \"Theyre not big, so when they hatched, your animals are fairly little.\", The point, he explained, is that \"people say, Oh, on Noahs ark, there wasnt enough room to have all the dinosaurs and other animals., \"Well, if you take a young one thats small on the ark, youve got plenty of room,\" Bennett said. \"You wouldnt want to take an old, fully grown adult, because, after the flood, their purpose was to reproduce and populate the earth again.\", maria.laganga@latimes.com, Twitter: @marialaganga]", "Date": "20150325", "Title": "[Creationist museum feels right at home in Idaho]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com//news/nationworld/la-na-boise-creationism-20150325-story.html\n", "Author": "[Maria L.

{"Content": "[\"The people feared the mayor of Chicago and flinched when he became angry. Later, after proper conditioning, they were told to love him. And this is how we lived through the Festivus of Rahm Love.\" , Thats how I imagine the inscription will read when it is found centuries from now, carved upon the dusty tomb of some unknown Rahmulan from Chicago of 2015. That unknown Rahmulan must be alive right now, and is most likely reading this very newspaper column, perhaps while sipping a latte, eager to learn more about the campaign between Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Cook County Commissioner Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia. It is a mayoral election, yes. And Rahm went negative. But now its the \"Rahm Love\" campaign, or Festivus of Rahm Love. See what millions of dollars can do? The man was once considered positively unlikable  with a big likability deficit, especially among black women  but now theres so much Rahm sugar available that we all might be on the verge of a bad case of political diabetes. And, as the Festivus of Rahm Love continues, remember that Chicago is the most Roman of all American cities. Not modern Roman, but of ancient Rome. The wealthy oligarchs who installed Rahm as caretaker for Daley have bestowed tens of millions of dollars upon Emanuel for TV ads. The oligarchs, most of them Republican, have long subsidized Democratic political bosses to keep order in Chicago. Rahm, or perhaps Rahmulus, is the first of his name on Chicagos iron throne. But historians of the Democratic machine might tell you there were masters of fear and adoration long before Rahm showed up. It has ever been thus:, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel fell short of enough votes to win the Feb. 24 primary, forcing a runoff April 7 with Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia. First the whip of government is applied. Then the hand is extended, to be kissed and adored. And now, clearly, Rahm is being bathed in all manner of adoration. At a South Shore political gathering Tuesday, Rahm was beloved, and loudly, by black ministers from across the city at an endorsement session to which reporters were invited. Charlie Bowen is the guy from City Hall who plays the good shepherd to his flock of black clergy. Hes the Democratic operative who handles them. And for years Charlie has been in the background when ministers endorse the mayor of Chicago, whether the mayor be named Byrne or Washington or Sawyer or Daley. \"Give us this day our Daley, Daley, Daley bread,\" theyd say for Daley father and son. Now Rahm is the boss. And they were full of praise for Rahm. Mayor Emanuel stood in between the ministers, most of them much taller than he, so he was dwarfed by their size and he stood in their shadow. But he was the center of attention. And for a second as they praised him, Rahms eyes were closed. Thats right. In a phone photo taken by reporter William Lee, aka \"Old School\" in this column, you can see the miracle overtake the mayor. Rahms eyes are closed, his face is like an angels and tilted toward heaven. There is a beatific smile upon his lips and what seems to be a spiritual light upon him, as the ministers pledged to get out the vote for their mayor. Praise the Lord. So much for the separation of church and state. The ministers said their \"knowledge and wisdom of God\" led them to endorse Emanuel for re-election. The message from the Chicago holy men was clear: They know Gods mind, and the Almighty wants Rahm, not that Chuy fella. ABC-Channel 7 reporter Charles Thomas asked: Is a vote for Chuy a vote against God?, And, when lightning did not strike Thomas down, the ministers grumbled, muttering, \"No.\" Pastor Jo Ann Long, a big-time Rahmulan, said:, \"Were not saying a vote for Chuy Garcia is a vote against God. Were simply saying we are choice-driven. Our decisions many times are based upon our consideration  after we consider all of the factual evidence, we want the truth. And thats how we made our choice. Our choice today is Mayor Rahm Emanuel.\", I really dont know what that means, but some day shell have to answer to You-Know-Who. And if that werent enough, the hotel workers union is out with a series of emotional \"Rahm Love\" TV commercials. I didnt call it \"Rahm Love.\" The hotel workers did, and they made T-shirts. The 15-second commercials star African-American women saying Rahm really loves them and their kids. \"We wait on people all day long. But we didnt have to wait for Rahm\" says Bertha McGee, a McCormick Place cashier, in a \"Rahm Love\" commercial. \"He came to us and then he fought like you-know-what to help us. Thats Rahm Love,\" McGee said. Thats almost spiritual, as if a bearded Rahm walked out of the wilderness after a fortnight of eating locusts, wearing sandals, ready to battle their enemies. \"Rahm Love,\" said Roushaunda Williams, a bartender at the Palmer House. \"Its how the mayor fights so that hotel workers can earn a decent living.\", \"Airport workers? We call it Rahm Love,\" said Tamekah Shivers, who works at a coffee shop at OHare International Airport. \"Rahm Love feeds the kids and respects my work.\", He loves the kids. He fights the enemies. He respects the people. When will he feed the multitudes?, And the oligarchs drop their millions, and the clergy prays, the Festivus of Rahm Love continues and on your TV screens, some voters all but kiss his hand. Are you not entertained? Its all about love.

{"Content": "[When it comes to the central issues driving their campaigns, Elgin City Council candidates offer a range of concerns  with most focusing on economic matters  when asked, \"What do you see as the main issue driving your campaign?\", Southwest Area Neighborhood President Andrew Cuming said that his main issue is \"a combination of addressing the current tax and spend policies and also the overly complicated and burdensome levels of ordinances, codes and bureaucracy.\", Cuming did not provide a specific example of a \"tax and spend\" policy. He did suggest \"having a simple process where people can get business occupancy permits within minutes online instead of weeks of approvals would help our city immensely. Not having to go get a permit to repair your own fence, just follow the guidelines on fences in the city, would make life easier and cheaper for our residents.\", Hotel General Manager Jason Dusenberry stated, \"the City of Elgin keeps spending more money. City expenditures go far beyond basic services, and more importantly what our citizens actually want. We need good streets, waste removal, and public safety. On the other hand we dont necessarily need three golf courses, more image consultants, yoga classes, or indoor water parks. City Hall should not be the principal patron of the arts in downtown Elgin. And we shouldnt be buying tickets or tables for city workers and politicians to attend high priced fundraisers.\", Cab company owner Jaime Hjelm claims Elgin is \"lacking the economic development or businesses that it needs to run efficiently. When a community loses businesses, or has a lack of, the tax base is eroding. As a result, the tax burden is then shifted to the homeowners. The current plan to bring business in, or even to have open communication lines to the businesses that are currently here, is poor.\" She also claims zoning on some arterial streets has become too restrictive making it harder to buy and sell suitable commercial property in Elgin. Hjelm feels Elgin \"needs a specialized marketing group that will be paid for business recruitment by what they bring in, not being paid regardless if they bring anything in. Quarterly reports are needed to gauge what is new, and what has left, and why the businesses left Elgin...Have round table talk sessions for current small business owners in Elgin.\", Retired corporate counsel Mo Iqbal said his goals are to keep the line on property taxes, reduce spending in city government, nurture economic growth, maintain Elgins quality of life, and promote safe, secure neighborhoods. \"I bring to the table my analytical expertise,\" Iqbal said. \"I will reach across the spectrum to build consensus.\", Valley Creek resident Fred Moulton said that \"working with other organizations we need to bring in our own (economic) development director, either as a regular employee or possible as a contracted employee, to attract and to retain sales tax revenue generating businesses. Elgin lags far behind some of our immediate neighborhoods in this area. Its simple. The more sales tax revenue the less dependence upon property taxes and utility fees.\", Moulton also would like to see Elgin do more to improve its infrastructure, the upkeep on foreclosed homes, and its code enforcement department. Wing Park area resident Julie Schmidt said, \"Im running for City Council to ensure that hard-earned tax dollars are wisely spent with a focus on those priorities which I view as the responsibility of local government  specifically, law and order, infrastructure, and carefully defined and limited community and business development activities,\" she stated. \"Cuts in revenue are inevitable, either from the State, which continues to seek any dollar it can get its hands on, or a declining tax base due to net out-migration in Illinois.\", Far west side resident Kyle Scifert said the focus of his campaign is \"fiscal responsibility tied with economic development. We must stop the culture of spending. In times of budget surplus, our elected leaders need to have the fortitude to not find reasons to spend the money, but rather save it for difficult times that lay ahead. Our economic development needs to just not focus on attracting new businesses to the city, but offering assistance to keeping them successful through benchmarking and training.\", As for incumbents, Tish Powell said the main issue driving her campaign is \"focusing on the successes we have achieved and ensuring that we make decisions that continue to move Elgin forward. With uncertainty at the state level in terms of local government revenue sharing, we will no doubt be faced with some tough decisions. I want to engage the community in that decision making process as we establish priorities and make any needed cuts. I also want to focus on increasing economic development in Elgin, both through attracting new businesses and encouraging the expansion of current businesses.\", She suggested Elgin work with other local institutions and organizations to form a high tech and/or green business incubator. Fellow incumbent Toby Shaw said, \"Taxation and spending continue to be the front and center issue. We continue to face challenges in the following areas: pension liabilities, unfunded mandates such as Obamacare, declining (Grand Victoria Casino) revenues, and reductions in state funding. I will continue to vote against tax increases and find opportunities to reduce expenses within the cities budget.\", If re-elected Shaw said he would work to maintain current tax and fee levels while preserving solid core services. \"Cuts in state funding will force us to make tough decisions and residents can count on me to protect their interests,\" Shaw said. He also would like to see the city \"create jobs and opportunities through growth in retail and commercial activity\" and work to Improve neighborhoods by such means as increasing odd/even parking zones and ensuring the impartial application of code enforcement. Senior Councilman John Steffen said his main issue is \"maintaining budgeting and spending standards that find efficiencies and savings and position the city to avoid the ever increasing costs to provide city services.\", To that end, Steffen would like Elgin to \"implement performance-based budgeting  budgeting for outcomes or aligning our spending to results or outcomes we intend to achieve. Past American Legion Post 57 Commander Rose Martinez was appointed to the Elgin City Council last spring to finish Anna Moellers term. Moeller left her post after being appointed to fill the vacancy left when State Rep. Keith Farnham (D-Elgin) resigned in the wake of a child pornography scandal and his subsequent conviction on related charges. In terms of both safety and economic development, Martinez said she would like Elgin to look at widening Route 20 west of Randall Road. \"There are ways to generate money back to the city that will alleviate our economic problems that might come our way or to help with the unfunded mandates,\" Martinez said. \"We could become the sports mecca of northern Illinois  supported with hotels and restaurants  by developing year-round sports complexes. We can also look into selling our water to more communities besides Bartlett and Sleepy Hollow. We have been in the black in our budgets, and we need to stay there.\", MDanahey@tribpub.com]", "Date": "20150324", "Title": "[Elgin City Council candidates say economic issues shape their campaigns]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com//suburbs/elgin-courier-news/news/ct-ecn-council-candidates-issue-st-0324-20150324-story.html\n", "Author": "[Mike Danahey]"}
{"Content": "[Generating new revenue for Winfield through commercial development and a better partnership with Central DuPage Hospital are necessary for the villages prosperity, hopefuls for the Winfield Board of Trustees said. Eight candidates are seeking three seats in the April 7 election. Two incumbents are running, with one joining two other candidates to form a slate, Seven hopefuls said the village needs to generate new revenue by attracting business development to Roosevelt and St. Charles roads. That money should then be used to bolster the police department, pave roads and support general village services, the candidates agreed. One immediate obstacle is the possible loss of about $500,000 in state income tax money slated to be returned to the village. Gov. Bruce Rauner has bandied about the idea of withholding those monies to shore up holes in the states budget, and if that happens, the candidates said, it would hurt the villages annual budget of about $5 million. Trustees Tony Reyes and Jim Hughes are seeking re-election, while Trustee Tim Allen will step down at the end of his term. Reyes, former Trustee Jay Olson and Rob Hanlon are running as a slate. The ballot is rounded out by Robert Greer, Dennis Hogan, Carl Sorgatz and Robert Borsodi. Seeking his second term on the board, Reyes described Winfield as a \"train wreck\" because of its inability to provide essential services, such as policing. Reyes said the police force has been reduced by 10 officers. \"Winfield deserves to have excellent police coverage,\" said Reyes, who owns a commercial packing business in St. Charles. Reyes, 61, said the village should assist Central DuPage Hospital, the largest property taxpayer, in expanding. He said divisive elements in the community were contributing factors to the hospital building its proton therapy treatment center in Warrenville. He suggested looking at a downtown TIF district that has not been properly used since its creation almost 10 years ago. Olson, an engineer, said his message is simple  more business and less taxation. Village leadership needs to bring in new development to be able to provide essential services to residents, he said, adding that his background in business has put him in touch with a network of professionals who could help develop land on Roosevelt and St. Charles roads. He laid out a two-year timeline, instead of the proposed 10 years. \"We need diverse development, and over the years there has been a hesitancy to allow that development,\" Olson, 57, said. Hanlon, the third leg of the slate, agreed on the need to develop Roosevelt Road and to partner with CDH in its need for office space and parking needs. Hanlon, 49, said the next board needs to implement the comprehensive growth plan that was adopted last year to attract sustainable development. \"We need to create a predictable and stable environment. That will create growth,\" said Hanlon, chief information officer at TreeHouse Foods in Oak Brook. \"Winfield really has an opportunity to work with the hospital to partner together to create the environment to allow them the expansion they need.\", Hughes, 47, said a possible loss of state income tax money emphasizes the need for the village to develop its own revenue sources though new development. The comprehensive plan to develop Roosevelt Road should be followed, he said. Hughes, a computer engineer, also cited partnering with CDH, pointing out that the hospital has proven it can build new developments, such as the Ronald McDonald House, in a short time. \"Theyre the partner who can help revitalize our town center,\" he said. Greer, 61, a retired pastor, agreed that encouraging commercial development is the best way to generate new funds. He suggests involving a consulting firm to plot the correct course for attracting developers. On village finances, he said some savings is possible internally, but acknowledged staff has been streamlined to the point he doesnt know what else could be done there. \"Development is the best way to address our funding issues,\" Greer said. An additional issue for Greer is what he sees as the boards history of secrecy. He would make decision-making more transparent, he said. Like Greer, Hogan, a former newspaper reporter and Army Corps of Engineers real estate director, said hes been sickened by transparency violations, although he said the current board has helped move things in a better direction. Hogan, who served as the chairman of the Comprehensive Plan Steering Committee, said he wants to see \"high-quality\" development that will generate sustained sales taxes. To work with the hospitals need for space, Hogan said he would like to see development in Town Center where ground-floor space would be reserved for commercial tenants and the upper floors could be used for the hospitals parking or office space needs. As village treasurer for five years, Sorgatz said he has a \"good handle\" on Winfields financial situation  a situation that could turn dire if Gov. Rauners withholding plan is adopted. \"That would be a severe hit for us we have to look at how were operating and creating a measure of self sustainability\" said Sorgatz, a financial planner by trade. Like the other candidates, Sorgatz said Winfield needs to move forward with developing Rosevelt and St. Charles roads as well as the villages Town Center. Sorgatz, 62, said he wants to see a development that attracts businesses that bring in the most sales tax dollars per square foot. Sorgatz also wants to build a stronger relationship with the hospital to help them with their expansion needs, while finding a reciprocal arrangement with CDH to infuse more tax dollars into the village.

Parro, a 25-year Bolingbrook resident, had two children who attend Valley View schools and is a district substitute teacher, she said in an email. She said she will resign if elected. Boudouris said in an email that he lives in Romeoville and has no children attending the district. Quigley was first elected to the board in 2007 and assumed the presidency in 2009.

{"Content": "[President Barack Obama agreed Tuesday to slow the U.S. military pullout from Afghanistan at the request of its new government but insisted the delay wont jeopardize his commitment to end Americas longest war before leaving office. In a shift from his previous plan, Obama said the U.S. would leave its 9,800 troops currently in Afghanistan in place rather than downsizing to 5,500 by years end. The size of the U.S. footprint for next year is still to be decided, he said, but he brushed aside any speculation the withdrawal will bleed into 2017 when the next president takes over. \"The date for us to have completed our drawdown will not change,\" Obama declared. Afghan President Ashraf Ghanis inaugural visit to the White House offered a stark contrast to visits by his predecessor, Hamid Karzai, who was viewed by U.S. officials as prickly and unreliable. Ghani went out of his way to thank the U.S. for its sacrifices in his country, offering a window into the efforts by Obama and him to rehabilitate the U.S.-Afghan relationship. \"This visit is an opportunity to begin a new chapter between our two nations,\" Obama said during a joint news conference in the East Room. As for the delayed drawdown of U.S. troops, Obama said he and his military leaders believe \"that providing this additional time frame during this fighting season for us to be able to help the Afghan security forces succeed is well worth it.\", He acknowledged the change of plans will prevent some U.S. troops from coming home when they expected, but he suggested the danger will be minimized because they wont be in combat. The U.S. combat role in Afghanistan officially ended late last year, a down payment on Obamas re-election pledge to wind down the war the U.S. launched in the days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The policy shift followed weeks of White House deliberations about whether to fulfill Ghanis requests to keep more troops in Afghanistan longer  particularly as the tough spring fighting season approaches. Afghan security forces are still struggling to gain the strength needed to protect the volatile country and to fend offIslamicStatefighters whose attempts to recruit in Afghanistan have been cause for regional concern. \"Afghanistan remains a very dangerous place,\" Obama said, noting that insurgents still launch attacks and plot suicide bombings to target civilians. Yet he declared his confidence in Ghani, who he said had \"taken on the mantle of commander in chief in a way that we have not seen in the past from an Afghan president.\", Obamas foreign policy critics, including some hawkish Republicans, have long urged him to leave more forces in the country and have accused him of setting artificial, politically driven deadlines for withdrawal. House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio said he was reviewing Obamas proposal and hoped it would \"meet the requests of our Afghan partners, our commanders on the ground and bipartisan members of Congress.\", For Obama, Ghani represents a last, best hope to make good on a key component of his foreign policy legacy: his promise to end the war before leaving office, keeping a thousand or so troops at the embassy to coordinate security. Ghani, who lived in the U.S. for more than a decade, has been a welcome change for the U.S. administration. Frustration with his predecessor reached a boiling point when Karzai refused to sign the security agreements needed for the U.S. to leave troops in his country. Ghani signed them within days of taking office and has sought to differentiate himself by showing deep appreciation for U.S. investment in his military  more than $60 billion so far. After hotly contested election results, Ghani and chief rival Abdullah Abdullah agreed to share power, with Abdullah assuming the new role of chief executive. The two traveled together to Washington in a display of unity. Yet political tensions have prevented the leaders from putting together a full cabinet, half a year into their term. Ghani is clearly aware that many Americans are exhausted by 14 years of war and are questioning whether its worth the continued investment. He spent the morning laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns. And in his appearance with Obama, he ticked through statistics that put the U.S. sacrifice in vivid terms: more than 2,200 troops killed, and 22,000 others wounded. \"You stood shoulder to shoulder with us, and Id like to say thank you,\" Ghani said. He added, with a wry smile, \"I would also like to thank the American taxpayer for his and her hard-earned dollars that has enabled us.\", Associated Press]", "Date": "20150324", "Title": "[Obama agrees to slow U.S. pullout from Afghanistan]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com//news/nationworld/chi-obama-afghan-us-troop-exit-20150324-story.html\n", "Author": "[]"}
{"Content": "[Red light cameras were once again up for discussion this week in East Dundee. At last weeks board meeting, the Village Board deliberated whether to extend its red light camera contract with RedSpeed Illinois. During that meeting, local resident Bob Kaplow said the red light camera installed at the intersection of routes 68 and 72 in September of 2009 is in violation of Illinois law because the yellow light times are too short for traffic conditions. He told board members the shorter yellow light means the possibility for more accidents. Kaplow asked village officials to remove the cameras and void the illegally issued tickets and refund the fines collected. The villages other red light camera, located at routes 25 and 72, was installed in 2011. The Village Board opted to table the issue for more discussion. At this weeks committee of the whole meeting, Trustee Allen Skillicorn asked board members to delay voting on whether to extend the contract until after the April 7 election. Four candidates are running for three spots on the East Dundee Village Board. Incumbents include Jeffrey Lynam and Skillicorn. Newcomers are former village board president Jerald Bartels and Alan Hall. \"Theres no secret Id be voting against it,\" Skillicorn said. \"But I would like to wait on a vote so the new board could have a decision.\", The village has until Sept. 11 to renew its contract. Some trustees said they would be in favor of tabling the vote until after the swearing in of the new board. According to village documents, East Dundee Police Chief Terry Mee said in follow-up communication with Kaplow after last weeks meeting Kaplow referenced a specific violation notice for the intersection at routes 72 and 68 that a family member received in January. Kaplow told village officials it was studied by video forensic specialist Barnet Fagel of RedLightDoctor.com. Mee said the incident was a clear red light violation and was approved as such when the file was received from RedSpeed. An administrative adjudication hearing was requested for the violation and the owner was found liable for the $100 fine. Trustee Rob Gorman said he was also able to view the video and it showed the villages yellow lights are not in violation. \"We watched the frames and it happens to be exactly three seconds. According to state law it needs to be three seconds so the bottom line is our lights are correct,\" he said. Gorman said East Dundee also throws out more than 75 percent of the tickets. \"It takes an egregious violation for us to ticket,\" he said. \"Im proud to be the lowest percentage ticketed. Were not doing this for the money. Were doing this from the standpoint that folks running red lights are getting tickets.\", According to village documents, from March of 2014 through February of 2015, the revenue generated from the photo red light enforcement was $161,842. Lynam said while he was not in favor or the cameras when they were first installed \"now it has a different flavor to it if we decide to eliminate them.\", \"We would have to come up with a way to make up that revenue shortfall it would create,\" he said. \"And if we add that to Rauners potential 50 percent reduction in our share of the income tax, that puts us up to a $300,000 shortfall so were really going to have to sharpen our pencils to figure out how to go about that.\", Because it was a committee meeting, no final action was taken on the issue.

{"Content": "[In 1982, during one of many visits to Israel, I had the opportunity to speak with Prime Minister Menachem Begin, who told me, \"Israel needs friends.\" He added that in the end, his nation could not trust any nation with its fate and security. The protection of Israel, he said, was ultimately the responsibility of Israelis. Begins comment was prophetic given the petulance of our current president, who behaves like an enemy of Israel when he attempts to impose a Palestinian state on Israel and negotiate a deal with Iran that can only lead to new threats against the Jewish state and further destabilize the chaotic Middle East. In his determination to strike a deal with Iran over its nuclear weapons program (which Iran has denied exists, so what is the U.S. negotiating?), President Obama has traded history, facts and reality for a potential deal with a regime that promotes terrorism around the world and is busy attaching Iraq to its vision of a greater Persian Empire. Last Saturday, Irans Supreme leader Ali Khamenei again called for \"Death to America,\" just one day after President Obama appealed to Iranians in a video message to seize a \"historic opportunity\" for a nuclear deal and a better future. The leader of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, also continues to use inflammatory rhetoric about the ultimate destruction of Israel. What should this tell us?, The president is cozying up to a nation that oppresses women, has an apocalyptic view of the world and believes that if it starts a nuclear war the 12th Imam -- the Islamic messiah -- will emerge from a well and bring peace on Earth and good will, at least to Shia Muslim men. Women will remain subject to male domination and have only the few rights given to them by men. Israel, which embraces Western values of free elections, religious tolerance and pluralism, a free press and equal rights for women is treated by President Obama and his administration as Iran should be treated. Do these people suffer from diplomatic dyslexia, or anti-Semitism?, The coming nuclear deal with Iran, if it occurs, will be a sham from the start. Agreements between nations require at least some trust, but Iran has as much credibility as a double-your-money promise from Bernie Madoff. Why should Israel be forced to surrender more land to an enemy that has sworn to destroy it? A Palestinian state would likely be used as a launching pad for an attack. Gaza is a perfect example. It has been used by Hamas to attack Israel, which unilaterally and foolishly gave it up in hopes of promoting peace. Suicide is not in Israels interests, or that of the United States, but suicide is what President Obama seems to want Israel to commit by pressuring it to return to indefensible 1967 borders and accept a nuclear deal with Iran. That two states is not what Israels enemies want was made clear enough when President Clinton brought then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and PLO leader Yasser Arafat to Camp David in 2000. Barak offered Arafat virtually everything he asked for -- 95 percent by some estimates -- and Arafat rejected the offer. Arafat, his contemporaries and those who have come after him, desire only one state headed by themselves with no Jewish state and no Jewish presence, as evidenced by the wars and terrorist attacks they have launched and continue to wage against Israel. In Deuteronomy 17:7, God instructs the ancient Israelites: \"You must purge the evil from among you.\", In his dangerous pursuit of a problematic nuclear weapons deal with Iran and his attempt to marry a cancerous Palestinian state to the land of Israel, President Obama is not purging evil; hes inviting it to spread. History will judge him for this as it has every other nation that has harmed \"the apple of His eye.\" (Zechariah 2:8), (Readers may email Cal Thomas at tcaeditors@tribpub.com.),  (c) 2015 Tribune Content Agency, LLC.]", "Date": "20150324", "Title": "[Disastrous Iran deal may prove fatal to Israel]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com//news/columnists/sns-201503231400--tms--cthomastq--b-a20150324-20150324-column.html\n", "Author": "[Cal Thomas]"}
{"Content": "[The five candidates vying for three seats on the board of Wheaton Warrenville Community Unit District 200 on April 7 hold divergent views on how to approach a potential upgrade of the Jefferson Early Childhood Center. In 2013, voters in the district, which covers Wheaton, Warrenville and parts of Carol Stream and Winfield, rejected a proposal to raise taxes by $17.6 million to build a replacement for the pre-kindergarten facility, which is a former elementary school built in the 1950s. In recent months, the Engage 200 program has studied how better to understand the communitys views on that failed referendum question, and the district has asked architects for proposals for reconstructing Jefferson and updating other schools. Incumbent Jim Gambaiani of Wheaton, a software company president who is seeking a second term, said he is \"open to having any conversation\" about Jefferson, but stressed that it should be within the context of what the district can afford, particularly given that the facilities planning committee he sits on has identified some $45 million in maintenance needs for district buildings over the next three years. \"Ive been very consistent about my position on Jefferson. I want to make sure people know and recognize the great work that (staff does) at Jefferson, but the referendum to me was not a referendum about Jefferson but about any buildings in this district based on our financial condition,\" Gambaiani said. \"For me, we have a very daunting task here, and (in that referendum) we were looking at spending $17 million in a debt service situation when the district could not afford it.\", Looking ahead, Gambaiani said focusing on any one building \"is inconsistent with what the public has told us, which is to present a comprehensive plan and a 21st-century learning environment for all the buildings.\", Challenger Judith Zapf of Carol Stream, a real estate agent and longtime PTA and Washington Elementary School volunteer, has a very personal tie to Jefferson. Her son began receiving physical therapy and speech therapy there at age 3 and today is a \"Jefferson success story.\", The building is \"outdated,\" Zapf said, and the Engage 200 process offers the district the opportunity to gain stronger community buy-in. \"A lot of people did not really understand Jefferson, and the fact that were federally mandated to provide early childhood education,\" she said. \"So we need to provide more information to the community and find out how that fits. I feel confident that in collaborating with the community and generating understanding, we can come up with a solution that will best serve the needs of the community.\", Zapf added that her hope is for a facilities master plan involving ongoing maintenance to all district buildings and an upgrade to Jefferson. Challenger Gary Tonn began a second career as a special education aide at Wheaton Warrenville South High School a decade ago after a long career in engineering and management. For him, the Jefferson issue boils down to community trust. \"Its obvious\" that something needs to be done with Jefferson, he said. However, voters rejected the 2013 referendum question because they had lost trust in Dist. 200 after a series of events where the public was outraged at board decisions or disbelieved the districts spin, including a massive payout to former Supt. Gary Catalani, the mysterious circumstances surrounding former Supt. Richard Drurys departure and the boards decision not to enforce a $40,000 early-exit penalty in former Supt. Brian Harris contract. Tonn also cited faulty estimates the district gave voters in the successful referendum question to build a new Hubble Middle School. He said very high costs were given to renovate the old Hubble, which ultimately was razed, and an estimated sale amount for that property was inflated. \"The community lost trust in the process,\" Tonn said. \"The community said we need to do something with our pre-kindergarten program. That may mean a new Jefferson, but it may also mean remodeling and expanding an existing facility. I think the public has concerns that certain people want to take this opportunity to build a new facility thats going to win some kind of an award, and in different economic times, we might do that. But people have to realize that our state has got huge problems, we have huge debt and pensions are hanging over our head. Theres a lot of financial uncertainty here.\", Tonn said he believes the district also needs to specify the parameters of any pre-kindergarten program  whether it would be just for special-needs students, for every low-income child or all children. \"In order to sell this to the community, they have to have complete trust, and if they pick up on anything that smells like what they were told before on Hubble or anything else, its not going to fly,\" Tonn said. \"Theyre going to vote it down again. And if were talking about a referendum that means more taxes, (voters) have to be absolutely certain that the district is not wasting one dollar of tax money now and not wasting one minute of instruction time. Right now, I dont believe the community is there.\", Challenger Chris Crabtree of Winfield, a former Whittier Elementary School teacher who has led Monroe Middle Schools PTA and now heads District 200s PTA Council, said she supports a new Jefferson, and that \"the community really needs to understand that something does need to be done with Jefferson. \"When I sat through the Engage 200 process  and we discussed Jefferson, one of the very interesting things about it was, the community truly didnt understand that we have to educate the kids,\" she said. \"Were supposed to be doing this by law.\", For Crabtree, Jefferson work \"in bits and pieces\" isnt sufficient. \"Obviously what we had before was not something that the community supported, so I like  that were looking at this again,\" she said. Incumbent Jim Vroman of Wheaton, a retired attorney and 32-year district resident, said he prefers to wait for the facilities committee to report to the board this fall before advocating for any one option for Jefferson. But, he said, the building \"is totally inadequate for what we need to accomplish\" and \"doesnt meet the special education requirements we need to fill.\", Vroman also disputed other candidates concerns about finances, noting that the Illinois State Board of Education has given District 200 the highest financial status recognition because of balanced budgets and a rainy day fund that has eliminated the need for short-term borrowing. \"Standard and Poors has raised our credit rating twice in the past four years,\" Vroman said. \"Weve put the district on very good financial footing.\"]", "Date": "20150324", "Title": "[ Candidates differ on early-childhood building in District 200]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com//suburbs/wheaton/news/ct-wht-district-200-board-election-preview-tl-0326-20150324-story.html\n", "Author": "[Bob Goldsborough]"}
{"Content": "[Financial challenges and improving communication are the top concerns among five candidates seeking four seats on the La Grange Elementary School District 102 Board in the April 7 election. Candidates said they are alarmed by two proposals in Springfield that would severely impact District 102s finances. Senate Bill 1 has replaced last sessions Senate Bill 16 and would shift more funding to lower income school districts. District 102 stands to lose an estimated $2.7 million. \"We would have to find new revenue and be creative and look at more cuts in our budget,\" said newcomer Jason Kowalczyk. Kowalczyk was slated in November by the District 102 Delegate Assembly, a citizens group, which interviewed and endorsed four candidates from among nine hopefuls. The group also endorsed newcomers Amanda Jandris and Brian Anderson and incumbent Matthew Scott, who is seeking a second term. Jandris said the board would have to look carefully at funding cuts and how to fill the holes. Anderson said the board would need to differentiate between needs and wants and communicate the process effectively. \"Education funding in this state is broken, and this is not the right fix,\" Scotty said. A second measure under consideration in Springfield would require school districts to pay more of teacher pension costs gradually over the next decade. Board member Joyce Easter Fitch said cuts will be needed. Scotty estimated the additional retirement costs could be $1 million to $2 million in 10 years. \"All constituents should be informed and involved. The board cannot make decisions in a vacuum,\" Fitch said. \"Staff needs to play an integral part in this, as well as listing to parents and involving all residents. We need strategic planning.\", If both measures pass, the effect would be devastating, candidates said. They noted the district already is in deficit spending in the education fund with revenue shortfalls being offset by gradually drawing down fund balances. But candidates stopped short of committing to support a referendum proposal to raise more tax revenue as has been suggested by the current board. \"I cant say Im definitely doing that if Im on the board,\" Kowalczyk said. \"We need to do hard work. Its foolish to commit to that now.\", Jandris agreed and said more information is needed before voters are asked for more money. \"Good communication and collaboration is essential,\" she said. \"The only hope of passing a referendum with the voters is transparent communication with residents.\", Anderson said clearer communication with all residents, not just parents, is needed on financial matters. Scotty and Fitch acknowledged the current boards conscious choice to deplete fund balances in order to maintain high quality programs. \"I plan on helping the district makes sure this is a well-informed decision, by promoting the outstanding programs and people within the district,\" Scotty said. \"I would help the community learn more about the financial model that funds elementary education in Illinois.\", Fitch said greater community involvement is needed to determine the need for a referendum. \"The 102 community has always valued education, and I dont expect that to change, but I am sure they will want us to keep within our financial means,\" she said. Fitch suggested forming more citizen committees to promote residents involvement with the district, such as a citizen group to advocate for district needs with lawmakers in Springfield. Candidates said improved communication with residents is essential, as well as a smooth transition with the districts new superintendent, Kyle Schumacher, who starts July 1 after leading a district for four years in Telluride, Colo. jmichaels@pioneerlocal.com, Twitter: janemichaels22, The candidates, Brian Anderson, Age: 43, Home: LaGrange Park, District resident: 14 years, Occupation: vice president of supply chain firm; adjunct business professor Elmhurst College, Education: masters in supply chain, Elmhurst College; bachelors degree in education and business, Illinois State University, Civic experience: volunteer for Greater La Grange YMCA T-ball, and Village Field and Lyons Swim Club swimming programs, Political experience: None, Joyce Easter Fitch, Age: not listed, Home: LaGrange Park, District resident: more than 50 years, Occupation: educational consultant; retired District 102 teacher, director of technology, Education: bachelors degree in English, French secondary education, Knox College; masters degree in educational technology, National Louis University, Civic experience: director of SaltCreek American Art Foundation, Nattie McKinnon Gallery, Political experience: two terms on District 102 Board, currently vice president, Amanda Jandris, Age: 36, Home: La Grange, District resident: 10 years, Occupation: professor, Concordia University, Chicago, Education: doctorate in research methodology, educational leadership, Loyola University; masters degree in secondary education, Saint Xavier University; bachelors degree in biology, Principia College, Elsah, Ill.

{"Content": "[Editors Note: Speak Out is a reader-generated column of opinions. If you see something you disagree with or think is incorrect, please tell us! Call us at 312-222-2460. Stunned by shootings: Has it reached the point in this country where the governor of Wisconsin and the mayor of Madison have to apologize to the parents of the black man who was shot by the police officer because he attacked the police officer, yet its okay for people in Ferguson to riot and shoot officers in the face and chest? Oh well, thats what this country is coming to. Third world. Get used to it. Republicans missing at Selma: Hello, Speak Out. I would like to ask what has become of my Republican friends and neighbors on the subject of Selma. The newspaper is full of news about Selma, but I didnt see any of them going there or speaking about it. I wonder if they have taken an oath or perhaps there is a code of silence. Rising real estate taxes: I see the people in Kane County are going to get a real estate tax bump up. Our lousy officials who are running this state ought to be fired, from the lowest office worker to the top executive. Funny how it never works that taxes go down. They always go up. They assumed that everything was going well. You should not assume anything when taxpayers money is involved. Lets get rid of this whole crowd. We have an election coming up. For anyone who is for cutting taxes, give them your vote. Never mind the rest. Heroin heartbreak: This is about heroin and its effect on families. My sons ex-wife destroyed her family. She didnt work for 12 years. She stole jewelry, and she stole from me. Last time I saw her, she only weighed 80 pounds. She looked like a skeleton. This was a girl who was once beautiful. She chose heroin over her husband and two boys. The kids are going through hell. The 15-year-old is rebellious. This has taken such a toll on my health. We warned my son not to get involved with this woman. Now hes raising their sons. What a life. Keep a close eye on your family and warn them. Roused about Republicans: What is wrong with the Republicans? They are undermining the president. Total disrespect. I have never seen anything like this in the history of the United States. Is this man hated this much? What is Benjamin Netanyahu doing over here? What does he hold over the Republicans? This is the same thing he did with Iraq. He convinced the United States that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. He was set on fighting with Iraq. If the Republicans win the presidency, God help us all. Frustrated about Ferguson: I would like to comment on Ferguson, Missouri. I think I have the perfect solution. All the white police officers should just quit and find jobs in other places. All the white businesses that were burnt down should just be left as they are. All the white residents should just get up and leave and move somewhere else. In about a year, Ferguson will probably look like Detroit. They dont quite understand whats going on. If the guy had just gotten off the street, none of this would have happened. Retaliation situation: Well, look whats happening in Ferguson. Two policemen were shot. Thank God they werent killed. Its a hate crime, but you dont see the white people in Ferguson or nationwide marching or looting. Its called dealing with things in a civilized way. Not stealing. Of course the police are scared to death because of retaliation. Retaliation for what? He committed armed robbery two hours earlier and tried to get the policemans gun. What is not to understand? Its called self-defense. The basic line is the boy broke the law. Someone has to recognize whats right and whats wrong. Steer clear of religious war: Regarding our role in the Middle East, I think we should stay out of it. These people have been fighting each other for a thousand years. One group doesnt like the other group. Its all about religion. They will never get along. We dont belong in the middle of a religious war, and thats exactly whats going on over there. We should stay out of it. Governor guts spending: Thank God we have a governor that says no overspending while we have an enormous debt in Illinois. Democrats have run Illinois into the ground with their overspending ways. Finally we have a governor who has the courage to do what needs to be done despite his critics. Keep up the good work, governor. If you run again, Ill vote for you. Save instead of spend: Im reading the article about the forest preserves and park districts having to suspend work after Governor Rauners decision to suspend funding. It blows my mind to read what some of these forest preserves are spending. There really shouldnt be a need to spend on forest preserves. You buy it to preserve it, but they feel they have to totally redo it. They cut trees down and put up buildings. Everything that is totally against what a forest preserve is supposed to be. They should buy these properties and leave them alone. The park districts are another story, but Im sure they could fund things through other alternatives. Its about time that people think about how government just throws money away on a daily basis instead of whining about not being able to spend it anymore. Dont blame Obama: I would like to say that what Rudy Guiliani said about President Obama has a very racist tone. Everyone wants to blame everything on the president. The fact is that America, under the guidance of former President George Bush, invaded Iraq. The Israeli prime minister also had a hand in it. He said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The reason ISIS happened is because we invaded Iraq. Saddam Hussein had Iraq in check. When we took him out, the region became unstable. Wake up, America.

{"Content": "[The following letter is my personal opinion and is in no way meant to reflect the position of Antioch Township or my position as an elected official. Public bodies or elected officials cannot use their public office to influence the decision of the voting public as it relates to a public question on the April 7 ballot. As a 30-year resident of Antioch, let me say everyone agrees this community needs to have reliable ambulance service. Nobody wants their property taxes to go up and, in my opinion, it was an unfortunate series of events that brought us to having to make this difficult decision. After thoughtful contemplation, I have come to the conclusion that this is not the issue to take a stand on. The question facing voters on April 7 is whether they are willing to pay an additional $82 per $100,000 of assessed valuation on their annual property tax bill for the purpose of providing reliable ambulance service. I hate having to pay this additional tax, but may the alternative be even worse?, The most important thing to me is the well-being of my family and the protection of my property. It occurred to me that in 2015 we are on the verge of an economic recovery and although I may disagree with certain events regarding this issue, if we are to attract new investment into our community and support property values, I have decided to vote \"yes\" on the ambulance funding question. I love this community and respect everyones choice to vote how they want on this important issue. So let me just say that no matter how you feel about it, please go to the polls and make your voice heard by voting.

{"Content": "[Naperville Mayor George Pradel was running late. On the other side of the bustling western suburb, leaders of a nonprofit childrens home had a BLT sandwich and Coke waiting for their esteemed guest, who was scheduled to tour a new wing he helped raise money to build. But Pradels 10 a.m. appointment went long, and then he was waylaid outside his Municipal Center office by a resident before he finally hopped into his lime green SUV and zipped across town to the lunch date at Almost Home Kids. No one seemed to mind the tardiness, however, when the stocky, crinkly-eyed mayor made his trademark entrance: hugs, baby-faced grins and an unmistakable energy that all but required someone in the room to shout \"hooray\" with a pumped fist. In his 20 years as mayor, Pradel has filled his days with lively appointments like these  grand opening parties, charity lunches, ribbon-cutting ceremonies and other celebratory events in a community that went from an emerging suburb to national rankings as a top city for young families, or, more recently, one of Americas \"snobbiest cities.\", Longtime residents and colleagues say Pradels style  which he, himself describes as Napervilles No. 1 cheerleader  suited the suburb well as about 42,000 new residents brought the need for new schools, fire stations and grocery stores during historic growth. Naperville faces a new era now, as Pradel, 77, prepares to step down after five terms in office in May. His departure leaves one of four mayoral candidates with a new task of leading the nearly built-out city through its next set of challenges, from filling empty storefronts to countering an unwanted reputation as a party town after several high-profile, alcohol-fueled incidents downtown. \"The whole climate of the downtown can get really, really nasty,\" said Peg Price, who served as Napervilles mayor from 1983 to 1991. \"Weve become a mecca for partying.\", Against that backdrop, Pradel prepares to bid farewell to his job and to the chapters of Napervilles story that seem to be ending along with it. \"Lets face it, he looks like the mayor of Munchkinland, or the Monopoly Guy, and yet, hes not afraid to kind of rip on that,\" said Naperville Councilman Bob Fieseler. \"Nobodys going to be able to do that without looking like a buffoon.\", Since 1969, Naperville has operated with a council-manager form of government, which uses a full-time city manager to run the communitys day-to-day operations, while the mayor serves as the citys public face, available to grand marshal parades and have dinner with girl scouts. Its an arrangement that Pradel said hes been grateful for since he won his first election in 1995, a victory that caught him by such surprise that he didnt even have an acceptance speech ready. \"I said, Now what am I going to do? Because I dont know anything about being a mayor,\" Pradel recalled. But Pradel did know Naperville. Born in Chicagos Hyde Park neighborhood, his family relocated to the west suburb when he was a toddler in 1939. Naperville had a population of 4,500, he said. As a child, Pradel learned to milk cows and ride tractors from his neighbors. He attended an early one-room school house, the Bronsonville School and graduated from Naperville Community High School in 1955. Pradel credits his parents with giving him and his five siblings a loving, idyllic childhood in the rural environment while instilling a sense of generosity and concern for others that stayed with him as an adult. The family paid frequent visits to a local orphanage, where his father played the violin and his mother played piano and told stories to the children. Pradel relished the feeling of helping so much, he aspired to become the head of an orphanage himself, he said. But when he returned to his parents house in Naperville after two years in the U.S. Marine Corps,, orphanages no longer operated in the design Pradel knew. A friend suggested he look into joining the police force instead. His wife, Pat, whom he had met through his sister and married in August 1960, supported the career choice. She also shared Pradels love of children that later inspired the couple to bring three foster children to live temporarily with them and their own two sons and daughter. Pradel began working for the Naperville Police Department in 1966 and earned his associate degree in police science from the College of DuPage in 1970. \"Id never thought about being a cop, but  I wanted to help people,\" he said. \"So selfishly, I got what I really wanted to do.\", On the police force, Pradel found a niche in reaching out to the young population. He implored fellow police officers to go beyond arresting troubled children and also offer them nurturing guidance that could keep them away from drugs, speeding and other wrongs. The approach earned him the nickname \"Officer Friendly.\", For 29 years, Pradel worked his way up the ranks in the police department. He walked the citys downtown streets at night, then volunteered his daytime hours visiting schools to talk to students about safety. In 1977, he led the charge to build a mini-community known as Safety Town, where children could ride bikes in a simulated town using proper hand signals and miniature street signs. Today, Safety Town still exists, teaching 1,700 students lessons on pedestrian, bike, fire, railroad, bus, animal and other safety each summer. Pradel also helped leaders in several neighboring communities  including Downers Grove, Glendale Heights and Darien  create similar programs. Warrenville Mayor David Brummel, a former teacher at Indian Plains School in nearby Eola, recalled his students being truly engaged by Pradel. \"I remember watching him and seeing how he would interact with the kids,\" Brummel said. \"In a world of manufactured things, George is a real man. He is genuine.\", Pradels dedication to the community took away from his time at home with his own children. But his family grew accustomed to  and eventually learned to appreciate  the civic duty Pradel demonstrated in his work. \"He was never home because he was always playing the downtown Santa, or on Thanksgiving, he was feeding the homeless,\" said Carol Pradel, his daughter. \"As a kid, you dont understand it as well as we do now  Looking at it now, us three kids are amazed at how they did it.\", And few in his family were surprised when leaders of several city homeowners groups encouraged him to run for office in 1995. He won with almost 60 percent of the vote. \"I dont think youre going to find anyone that has more love for this town than him,\" Carol Pradel said. When Pradel took office in 1995, Naperville had a population of about 103,000, according to U.S. Census data, and was in the midst of tremendous growth. Young families, attracted to the citys reputation for good schools and safe streets, were flocking to Naperville at a rate of nearly 10 new residentsevery day, said Doug Krieger, who became Napervilles city manager in 2008. The mayors job started at $15,000 and had no set expectation of hours in a workweek. But Pradel, who retired from the police department when elected mayor and was receiving a police pension, easily spent more than 40 hours each week hopping from one celebratory or symbolic event to the next, Krieger said, adding that the mayors salary is $30,000 today. Pradel read council meeting packets cover-to-cover and met with staff an hour or two before each meeting to stay versed on projects, Krieger said. Yet he also made it clear that he trusted staff and the City Council to deal with the minutiae of planning developments and managing growth, Krieger said. \"He is not one to be running from here and there in City Hall demanding things, or making a lot of noise,\" said Kenn Miller, who served on the City Council from 2005 to 2013. \"What he is is an ambassador for the city, the face of the city. He has done that well, and it has worked well for us.\", Despite the sunny role he chose, Pradel was not exempt from controversy and growing pains that came with the citys exploding population, which today stands at nearly 145,000. Concerned residents packed council chambers to complain about unwanted traffic from a major sports complex developed near neighborhoods in 1999. They picketed outside an Ogden Avenue restaurant called Show-Mes in 2011, which gained city approval to open with short-skirted waitresses serving food. It shut its doors 10 months later. And in 2013, some residents opposed the citys controversial decision to move to smart meter technology, which they argued was a threat to safety and privacy. Two vocal opponents were arrested. The controversies weighed heavily on Pradel, who said he did his best to be fair to constituents and businesses. At one point during a business trip downstate, he convinced the citys public utilities director to go to lunch at a Show-Mes franchise to see for himself whether the servers were as scantily clad and in poor taste as its critics contended. \"I went in there, sat down at this place and we thought: were probably going to be in the newspaper,\" Pradel said. \"But it was just like any other restaurant.\", Perhaps Pradels most difficult role came as head of the citys Liquor Commission, a role that comes with the position of mayor. For each of the many taverns that have opened in the community, especially downtown, in the last two decades, Pradel had to grant liquor licenses. Some residents contend that the lack of communication between downtown taverns and the police department was a factor that led to the stabbing death of Shaun Wild, a 24-year-old elementary school teacher who was killed while trying to break up a fight at a Naperville nightclub in February 2012. Wilds death  for which 30-year-old Daniel Olaska was found guilty of first-degree murder by a DuPage County jury this month  and other publicized incidents in the city have led Naperville leaders to tighten rules for bars. Bars can no longer allow patrons to enter, re-enter or buy shots in the hour before closing. In addition, noncraft beers are limited to 22 ounces, down from 24 ounces; there can be no announcement of last call for shots; bars cannot reduce the price of alcohol by more than 50 percent; and management is strongly encouraged to enroll all security staff in a new, city-endorsed local training course aimed at thwarting trouble. Pradel accepts part of the blame for the restrictions not being put in place sooner. \"I didnt push hard enough to bring the police department and people in downtown together earlier,\" Pradel said. \"I meant to do that. It just wasnt the right time.\", In other areas, Pradel is proud of bringing groups together, including the creation of a Senior Task Force to address the growing senior population. He also led the creation of two new city representatives, Chairmenof Chinese and Indian Outreach, to address notable growth in both demographics. \"His best role was really bringing people together,\" Krieger said, citing how Pradel attracted the DuPage Childrens Museum to the community, and allowed the city to partner on projects with the Chamber of Commerce. \"Hes the most recognizable person in Naperville and has been for a number of years.\", Perhaps this is why many who know him find it hard to believe Pradel  whose likeness has been used in a sculpture downtown, for a bobblehead and on golf balls used at an annual golf outing  will be removed from city affairs once his replacement is sworn in May 3. As Pat Pradel battles advanced stages of bone cancer, the mayor has said he owes it to his family to be with her now. \"She gave her time  with me so that I could serve the kids and residents of Naperville,\" Pradel said. \"I have an honor to pay back. Weve been married 55 years and I love her.\", He admits, however, that it will be hard to stay away from his other love  the city. Pradel has offered to help transition the new mayor into office, and hopes that the new official will call on him as a backup when he is unavailable. His daughter, Carol, who moved back into her parents home to help care for her mom, has offered to take over Pradels daily calendar, which she says is already booked through September with honorary ceremonies, from kicking off charity walks to greeting crowds at Napervilles Last Fling festival. \"I know hes heartbroken about leaving because thats just not him,\" she said. \"If he doesnt have someone that he needs to help, or introduce, or cut a ribbon for, hes not happy.\", For now, hes savoring his busy days, running from one appointment to the next, greeting rooms full of constituents with hugs and delivering his trademark smile before rushing across town  past hundreds of election campaign signs posted along streets  to his next appearance. \"The people that live in our city love me,\" Pradel said, \"and I can feel it.\", Vikki Ortiz Healy is a Tribune reporter.

{"Content": "[This past week, the president who is forcing Americans to have health care coverage suggested maybe they should be forced to vote. \"It would be transformative,\" President Barack Obama told a crowd in Cleveland. It would be transformative. It would transform this country into something its never been. And it will never happen. Australia may make its citizens vote under penalty of fine or even jail, Bolivia may threaten your paycheck, Belgium may threaten your future job prospects, but the U.S. will never hold a sword over its citizens heads. Not for an issue that this country was founded upon. Freedom to choose your leaders. Its no surprise Obama had to retreat from his comments a day after he made them. For one thing, experts now suggest forced voting could prove unconstitutional (free speech, etc.). Moreover, there is nothing that unites Americans more than lawmakers telling them what to do in the few areas they havent done it already. Voting -- or not voting -- is one of them. Which, in a way, is a shame. Because what Obama wants -- 100 percent turnout -- is a worthwhile idea. How much better would this country be if we all voted? How much more vested would its citizens feel? How much more could we say we are \"part of the process\" if we pulled a lever as quickly as we post a nasty comment?, But forcing people, sadly, is not the way. When Obama said, \"If everybody voted, then it would completely change the political map in this country,\" he wasnt incorrect. Poor people, young people and certain minorities are the least represented in voter registration. But it may not be the way you think. Before Obamas critics assume hes trying to get more African Americans to the polls, U.S. Census Bureau figures analyzed by statisticbrain.com show that blacks are just behind whites in terms of voter registration (70 percent vs. 73.5 percent). It is actually Asians, often cited as the major ethnic group most actively climbing the American dream ladder, that have the lowest registration (55 percent, less than Hispanics at 59 percent). And age clearly is a factor. People 18-24 have the lowest registration (58.5 percent), while the numbers climb steadily up to 65-74-year-olds (78 percent). Wealth and education level also matter. The more Americans have of each, the higher percentage of registration. Which suggests that the older, smarter and better off you get, the more concerned you are likely to be about the future of this country. Obama, in his force-them-to-vote idea, might be expressing partisan desires; pundits believe our unregistered masses would largely vote Democratic. (Im not so sure, by the way. There are plenty of conservative minorities and conservative high school dropouts.), But when the president says forcing people to vote \"would counteract (campaign) money more than anything,\" he is being naive. If anything, it might make things worse. As it is, politics is so overrun by money, elected officials only reach office if they are independently rich or are beholden to those who paid to get them there. Forcing everyone to vote would shoot costs to the moon. TV ads would become increasingly important (how else to reach large numbers and keep the message simple?) and TV already costs a fortune. Imagine campaigns needing countless ads in multiple languages? More travel? More appearances? The only savings might be in get-out-the-vote costs, but those would be offset by the huge cost of catering to the uninterested. Because lets face it. Forcing someone to do something doesnt make them engaged. Only 37 percent of eligible Americans cared enough to vote in the 2014 midterm elections. Imagine campaigns pandering to the 63 percent that might be dragging their bodies to a booth? We actually could get dumber, meaner, more cash-draining rhetoric than we have right now -- just trying to get people who really dont care to lean one way or the other. By the way, Australia also allows something called \"informal\" voting, which includes turning in a blank ballot. How many of these might America get if that was an option?, There is one thing we can take from the Aussies: Saturday voting. Over 17 percent of Americans who dont vote say its because of conflicts or inconvenience. Why do we stick to the archaic Tuesday elections -- when work is increasingly precious and less flexible than ever?, Why not try weekend voting? And real -- I mean real -- campaign finance reform that limits the barrage of negative ads that turn voters off. At least thats a beginning. Forcing Americans to vote is not. It feels more like an end.

{"Content": "[In a show of unity, U.S. and Afghan officials laid the groundwork for new relations between the two countries on Monday, including plans to seek American funding to maintain an Afghan security force of 352,000 and long-term counterterrorism efforts. Discussions over future U.S. troop levels continue as the war winds down. In an all-day session at the Camp David presidential retreat in Marylands Catoctin mountains, dozens of U.S. and Afghan officials, including Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Ash Carter, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and chief executive Abdullah Abdullah gathered to relaunch a relationship strained by nearly 14-years of war and often-testy relations with former Afghan President Hamid Karzai. During the meeting, the U.S. agreed to seek funding through 2017 for an Afghan force of 352,000, a level the nation has yet to meet, Carter said. U.S. officials said the Afghan government is trying to improve recruiting to make up for security forces who leave the service. They also agreed to require the Afghan government to complete specific reforms and meet other milestones in order to receive up to $800 million. U.S. officials said the Afghans suggested the incentive-based funding idea. The leaders of the two nations also said they would restart routine ministerial-level Defense and State Department meetings. Ghani is to meet with President Barack Obama on Tuesday, an engagement during which officials expect the U.S. to make clear its decision to slow the pace of the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan. Ghani and Abdullah fought a contentious election last year to replace Karzai, and their power-sharing agreement was lauded by Kerry, who played a key role in brokering it. \"It is easy today to underestimate the measure of courage and leadership and selflessness that was demanded at that moment, and that both of these leaders continue to show in their commitment to a unity government,\" Kerry said. He added that \"huge challenges remain\" but that the agreements to be reached this week will help pave the way for stability and security. Kerry said that the joint appearance at Camp David, along with the White House meetings, should serve as notice to the Taliban that the U.S.-Afghan relationship is back on track and they should negotiate rather than fight. \"All of these underscore to any Taliban, to anybody who wants to engage in violence that we are prepared in the long term to support our friends in Afghanistan,\" Kerry said. Obama has promised to pull remaining U.S. troops out by the end of his presidency. But deficiencies in the Afghan security forces, heavy casualties in the ranks of the Afghan army and police, a fragile new government and fears that Islamic State fighters could gain a foothold in Afghanistan have combined to persuade Obama to slow the withdrawal. Instead of trimming the current U.S. force of 9,800 to 5,500 by the end of this year, U.S. officials say the administration now might keep many of them there well into 2016. Obama has said that after that, the U.S. will maintain only an embassy-based security force in Kabul of perhaps 1,000 troops. Ghani, who has expressed worries about Islamic State militants trying to gain a foothold in his country, has pressed to keep more U.S. troops there longer, but Obama has promised to end both wars in Afghanistan before his presidency ends in January 2017. Both Carter and Kerry acknowledged the importance of the U.S continuing its counterterrorism missions in Afghanistan, even into 2017. Kerry said the U.S. is concerned about reports that Islamic State militants are recruiting in Afghanistan and that some Taliban are rebranding themselves as Islamic State members. He said the U.S. will continue to maintain a counterterrorism effort that is \"focused on al-Qaida at this moment\" but would also have the ability to assist the Afghan forces as they provide security for their nation. During a visit to the Pentagon earlier Monday, Ghani thanked U.S. troops and taxpayers for their sacrifices in nearly 14 years of war. He pledged that his impoverished country will not remain a burden to the West. \"We do not now ask what the United States can do for us,\" Ghani said. \"We want to say what Afghanistan will do for itself and for the world,\" he added. On arrival at Camp David, Ghani emphasized what he called a new phase of the U.S.-Afghan relationship. \"Its time for Afghanistan to reciprocate the gift that the United States has so generously provided over the years,\" he said. \"Reciprocating the gift means owning our problems, solving them and asking of ourselves what we must do for ourselves and for the region.\", Ghanis relationship with Washington stands in stark contrast to that of his predecessor, Karzai, whose antagonism toward the U.S. culminated in a refusal to sign security agreements with Washington and NATO before leaving office last year. Ghani signed the pacts within days of becoming president in September, and he has since enjoyed a close relationship with American diplomats and military leaders.

{"Content": "[Candidates for Lyons Township High School District 204 Board agree possible changes to state funding are the greatest challenges facing the district. Possible changes include a shift of funding to lower income districts and asking school districts to shoulder more of teacher pension payments. \"Were already looking to prepare alternatives,\" said board member John Polacek. \"We would want students education to be affected the least. All of the contracts would have to be renegotiated, and hopefully the Legislature will allow us to raise our levy.\", Polacek and Phil Palmer are seeking re-election to the School Board, facing incumbent Barbara Rosinsky, who was appointed to the board in July, and Anthony Przeklasa, who has 46 years experience as a high school teacher, administrator and superintendent of several districts. Only three will be elected April 7. Rosinsky said LT is fortunate to have substantial fund balances to fall back on. Teacher and administrative contacts also may have to be renegotiated, she said. Przeklasa estimates the district would have to come up with an additional $4.2 million for increased annual pension contributions. \"This is not a reasonable approach. We must engage our legislators,\" he said. Illinois schools are subject to tax cap laws allowing them to raise taxes generally according to an increase in the Consumer Price Index, which was 1.5 percent for 2014 reflected on bills payable in 2015. Unless the tax cap is lifted, School Board members would have to ask voters for more money through a referendum proposal or cut programs. Palmer and Polacek said a referendum to hike taxes is unlikely. \"Its not going to happen in the next four years. I cant imagine that scenario,\" Palmer said. \"The doom and gloom through Senate Bill 1 and pension reform hopefully will come to some sort of resolution.\", Polacek said LT voters havent been asked to approve a tax increase since the 1960s, and he doesnt see it happening in the next four years. He predicts lawmakers in Springfield will modify the tax cap law. Rosinsky said a tax hike would be painful for voters to approve, but they reluctantly would do so. Przeklasa said it would be necessary for the board to explain the need to voters and convince them about a tax increase. Polacek also said he favors continued exploration of a one-to-one student computer initiative to provide efficient delivery of materials and differentiated learning. Palmer said he will continue to press for a law allowing District 204 to withdraw from the Lyons Township School Treasurers Office, which oversees payroll and investments, so LT can manage its own financial affairs, saving the district $245,000 annually.

{"Content": "[With a small number of riders in recent years, the village of Oswego has decided to end its Park-n-Ride transportation service for Metra riders this summer. The Oswego Park-n-Ride has operated weekday rush hour bus service between two locations and the Aurora Transportation Center for the Metra Burlington Northern Santa Fe line. The village has decided to cease the subsidized commuter transportation service when a three-year contract with the Kendall Area Transit agency expires June 30. Village trustees during their recent 2016 budget discussions weighed data for bus ridership with the cost to taxpayers for having to subsidize 100 percent of the transportation program. \"While we have supported the development of public transportation infrastructure to serve the community until the arrival of Metra, sustainable bus ridership has proven to be elusive,\" Village Administrator Steve Jones said in a report to trustees. Jones said ridership peaked in 2008 but has since eroded. The village administrator said ridership has leveled-off from 2011 to the present, likely due to a combination of factors, including an increased availability of daily fee parking at the Aurora Transportation Center, recession-related employment losses in the area and multiple revisions to Pace and Kendall Area Transit bus routes and schedules over the years. Since 2004 the village has provided a commuter bus lot on the West Side at Mill Road and Station Drive. The village on Dec. 1 divided the routes as a way to attract ridership by offering an East Side lot location at Farmington Lakes Drive and Douglas Road. Before Oswego actually expanded service to the East Side, the village issued a survey to gauge ridership interest, during which 133 people responded as saying it was \"very likely\" or \"somewhat likely\" that they would utilize the service. But over the past three months the additional route generated only one to two riders per day. \"Our attempt to develop an East Side rider base has proven to be unsuccessful,\" Jones said, While parking in the lots is free, commuters pay $17.50 for a 10-ride bus pass or $30 per month for the service. The program from 2004 to 2012 was operated as Pace bus Route 907.. The villages three-year contract with the Kendall Area Transit agency came at a cost of $399,084. Jones said the agency has been notified that the village intends not to renew its contract for the program. Staff had offered three options to continue the existing service level, support a reduced level of service by eliminating the East Side lot or eliminating the Park-n-Ride entirely. The villages obligation for essentially three daily routes only on the West Side would have cost the village an estimated $51,000 the first year, but then the annual cost would drop- off for the next two years to about $38,000 and $37,000 because of the amortization of the bus cost. The cost to retain the existing service for both the West and East Sides would have cost the village $210,624 over the next three years. Jones said of the 32 riders in each of the past three months, roughly 35 percent of the riders live in Oswego. The Dial a Ride program at a cost of $45,000 annually to the village will continue. Jones explained the logic of offering the Park-n-Ride service while a study is underway to expand Metra commuter service. Oswego recently authorized the purchase of a 15-acre site for a future Metra commuter parking lot, although the commuter rail transportation system has not made a commitment to an Oswego station. He said the Park-n-Ride service was considered an interim program to await the arrival of a Metra commuter station in Oswego, but the availability of parking in Aurora has diminished the need for the service. Jones said the village remains committed to seeking a Metra station, as demonstrated by its purchase of the 15 acres. \"We will continue working with Metra to ensure this vision becomes reality,\" Jones said Monday. Village Trustee Gail Johnson, a candidate for village president in the April 7 election, said the workplace for an increasing number of people has changed in recent years. \"We have more and more people working from their homes than we have ever had,\" Johnson said during the recent budget discussions. Johnson said the cost to the village per rider is more than it was three years ago which makes it difficult to justify keeping the program in place. \"I find it really hard to justify - we literally could give them the cab money to go to the Aurora Transportation Center - it would be cheaper than the KAT bus. When I look at it like that, it doesnt make sense for us to keep funding it,\" Johnson said. Village President Brian LeClercq agreed. LeClercq several weeks ago said he would like to see the Oswego Senior Center provide some level of bus transportation for seniors needing to make routine physician appointments. \"I would rather see the money be reallocated to support our senior residents,\" LeClercq said.

{"Content": "[Candidates for Oak Brook village trustee say an increasing pension burden is a top issue that the next Village Board must address. \"We need to seriously consider creative, alternative ways to maintain high quality service while at the same time containing this mounting liability,\" said Edward N. Tiesenga. \"With a new village manager, this is an excellent time to do a department by department review to determine what steps can be taken to control costs and improve service levels, while maintaining the high level of village services we enjoy.\", Tiesenga is one of six candidates running for three seats on the Oak Brook Village Board. Incumbents Michael Manzo and Asif Yusuf both are seeking re-election and face Tiesenga, Elisa Templeton, Charles S. Thompson II and Michael Wencel in the April 7 election. Manzo defended the villages pension funding. \"The village of Oak Brook pension contributions have increased by nearly 50 percent, or $2.7 million over the last four years,\" he said. \"Oak Brook has done well to keep up with the ever increasing pension burden, but Springfield must enact real pension reforms to relieve the ill effects of the unfunded mandates passed by the state of Illinois.\", Yusuf believes Oak Brook officials should work to convince the legislature to enact pension reform to bring future pension benefits in line with the private sector, and to reduce future pension costs to a reasonable level. \"We will do this by working closely with our legislators, with whom we have a good working relationship,\" he said. \"We will also combine our efforts with other area communities, as this issue effects every municipality in our state.\", Thompson said village officials need to find creative financial solutions now. \"I dont agree that it is Springfields problem,\" Thompson said. \"It is ours, and Im willing to bring ideas that will keep us from kicking the can down the road. Our children should not have to fix it when the problem has spiraled out of control.\", Thompson suggested doing a 25-year study on Oak Brooks liability versus an annual actuarial estimate. He also wants to bring in an expert on pension underfunding and debt restructuring. \"I believe a board with legal, investment and actuarial expertise can tackle this problem on behalf of our village,\" he said. Tiesenga said the pension problem has been created by the Illinois General Assembly, but he doesnt believe Oak Brook officials can count on anyone in Springfield to solve it. Wencel believes its very important to repair what he called a \"severed and broken\" relationship with the Greater Oak Brook Chamber of Commerce, noting that more than half of Oak Brooks revenue is generated by retail sales tax. The village contributed more than $740,000 since 2006 to the chamber; however, the organization decided in September 2014 to no longer request funding from the village. Tracy Mulqueen, the chambers president and chief executive officer, said the chambers need to operate more efficiently and independently was the major reason for the decision. That decision was made after some trustees questioned where and how village contributions were being used. Mulqueen didnt say those questions were a factor in the decision. Wencel said village officials should support the Chamber because of its supportive role of businesses in the village. \"This is what the chamber wants and needs, compared with some of our board telling them how to run their organization, criticizing their objectives and deliverables and severing relationships,\" Wencel said. Wencel said he also would like to see improvements made at the Bath and Tennis Club. And he suggested reducing the number of Oak Brook polo matches to two larger events a year. Six matches are scheduled for the 2015 season. Candidate Elisa Templeton did not respond to Doings requests for an interview. cfieldman@pioneerlocal.com, Twitter: @chuckwriting, Michael Manzo, Age: 48, Profession: business owner, insurance, Family: married, three children, Current/previous elected office: Oak Brook trustee, 2011-present; former board member, Proviso High School District 209, Volunteer work/community organizations: Oak Brook Caucus; Oak Brook Little League coach; youth football and basketball coach; Kiwanis Club; committee chairman, Taste of Oak Brook, Charles S.

{"Content": "[Sheylla Lopes, a 19-year-old transgender woman, was walking down the street, talking on her cellphone when without warning a man came up from behind and slapped her in the face. Lopes says the daytime attack in central Sao Paulo, which knocked her phone to the ground, was relatively minor, something she expected might happen when she began to dress and live as a woman several years ago. She was more concerned, she said, about what could happen to her while plying her trade as a sex worker. \"We face every type of risk. Weve all heard about attacks on friends or colleagues close by,\" says Lopes, who prefers not to discuss the masculine name she had early in life. \"We all know we could die on the streets.\", Sao Paulo is host to the worlds largest gay rights parade, and during Carnaval, many men in drag gleefully partake in the festivities. Yet despite its international image of sexual freedom, Brazil has a deeply conservative streak and increasing homophobic violence. Gay rights groups said that in 2014, based on a count of news reports and legal cases, the pace of killings in a homophobic or transphobic attacks in Brazil was close to one a day. Transvestites and transsexuals were the victims in almost half of the cases. During her reelection campaign last year, President Dilma Rousseff pledged support to a long-delayed initiative to criminalize homophobia and classify attacks motivated by sexual orientation under the same criminal status as racist violence. But thanks to a recent turn to the right in Congress, powered in part by the rise of politicians tied to Evangelical Christian churches, passage of the bill is now uncertain. Its ultimate fate may help redefine Brazils moral identity. \"Brazil is an extremely contradictory country. On the one hand, we are a pink country, celebrating sexual diversity and showing gay couples easily on our telenovelas,\" said Luiz Mott, founder of the Grupo Gay da Bahia, an LGBT rights group. \"Then, there is another color, the red blood of victims. Brazil has unfortunately inherited deep institutional and cultural homophobia over hundreds of years ... and the country has become characterized by extreme violence and rising numbers of murders.\", According to his groups 2014 homicide report, at least 326 lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals were killed in attacks related to their sexual orientation last year, up from 159 in 2004. Last year, 163 victims were gay men and 134 were transgender individuals. The most deaths occurred in Sao Paulo state, the countrys most populous. Per capita, the deadliest state was Paraiba, in the northeast, where Lopes grew up. The group points out that in addition to the direct attacks listed in their report, homosexual and transgender Brazilians suffer from institutional homophobia that \"pushes them to the margins of society, where violence is endemic.\" Sex work, already risky in Brazil, is much riskier for transgender women, Mott says. Then there are the more minor abuses. At Carnaval celebrations this year in Olinda, in the state of Pernambuco, Magno da Costa Paim said he was kissing his boyfriend during a street party when police approached them. \"The officer slapped me in the face,\" Costa Paim said a few days later. \"He said, Get out of here ... get out of here,\" uttering a slur sometimes used against homosexual men. Proposed anti-homophobic legislation has been frozen in Congress for more than eight years, but Jean Wyllys, Brazils only openly gay legislator, has said he will present a new initiative this month, and hopes Rousseffs support will move it forward. \"Were in a battle to create a law that protects gay and trans Brazilians and that severely punishes those that violate their rights,\" Wyllys said by phone from Brasilia, Brazils capital. \"But Brazil is a very conservative country, and that conservatism has grown in the last few years, especially due to fundamentalist Christians that have become active in politics.\", Both Rousseff and Wyllys suffered a setback early this year when Congressman Eduardo Cunha was elected president of Brazils lower house. Rousseff, politically weakened by a corruption scandal at the state-run Petrobras oil company, was surprised by the unexpected election of Cunha, a conservative member of the ruling coalition and an Evangelical Christian who has spoken out against Brazils gay rights movement. When a telenovela featured two men kissing, Cunha took to Twitter to express his \"repulsion.\" He later said that Brazil was \"living through attacks, from gay pressure, marijuana smokers and abortionists.\", Cunha has the power to decide which bills are voted on. His office did not reply to interview requests or written questions on proposed anti-homophobia legislation, but the new House president used his position after taking over to push a different project: the creation of \"Heterosexual Pride Day.\", Recently, Lopes, who says she became a prostitute because it would have been difficult to get a more conventional job, was working her first Carnaval. It went fine, she said, but shed take any more security offered. \"The more protection we can get, the better,\" she said. \"To us, thats just obvious.\", Bevins is a special correspondent.]", "Date": "20150322", "Title": "[Homophobic attacks increase in seemingly gay-friendly Brazil]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com//news/nationworld/la-fg-ff-brazil-homophobia-20150322-story.html\n", "Author": "[Vincent Bevins]"}

{"Content": "[Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia joined with supporters in Englewood as they walked past abandoned buildings and trash-strewn vacant lots before coming upon one of the few occupied storefronts along Halsted Street between Marquette Road and 68th Street. \"The only place thats open is the casket place,\" Bishop James Dukes of the Liberation Christian Center explained to Garcia. \"The only economic business on the whole street is Illinois Casket, which speaks volumes as to what kind of community we live in.\", Standing near the doorway, next to what used to be a chop suey joint, Garcia asked owner Willis Webb, \"Whats your vision? What would you like to see?\", \"No empty lots,\" Webb replied. \"No empty lots. Thats what Id like to see.\", The single-story masonry building with a small American flag on the roof could serve as a metaphor for the problems plaguing Englewood and some other neighborhoods on the South and West sides where violent crime and a lack of jobs and economic development are ills that span generations. Both Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Garcia are spending a lot of time trying to win over African-American voters ahead of the April 7 election. Who black voters choose  or whether they vote at all  could determine Chicagos next mayor. For Emanuel, the message to black voters has been somewhat of a balancing act as he seeks to show sympathy with the challenges their neighborhoods face while also pointing to improvements he believes represent a long-term strategy that is starting to pay off. For Garcia, the focus has been to seize on Emanuels vulnerabilities  spikes in gun violence, closed schools and a continued shortage of jobs  while also positioning himself as an everyman of the neighborhoods who understands the obstacles minorities face. Four years ago, Emanuel rode significant support in the African-American community to an outright victory, but since then his backing among black voters has slipped. The mayor saw a large drop-off in black support in the February election, and now hes working to rebuild it in a one-on-one contest. Last month, Garcia managed to force a runoff with the mayor largely thanks to strong support from Hispanics and disaffected public employees, including strong backing from the Chicago Teachers Union. Now the challenger is trying to build what hes billed as a \"brown-black\" progressive coalition to capitalize on voter anger with Emanuel. The pitch, Emanuel counters Garcias criticisms by noting that homicides are down, characterizing the school closings as difficult but necessary, and suggesting hes made strides in driving jobs to hardscrabble neighborhoods. The mayor promotes his efforts to reduce food deserts, particularly the development of a Whole Foods in Englewood and the opening of a soap factory in Pullman, as showing his interest in economic opportunities outside downtown. More recently Emanuel announced \"Right to Thrive\" zones, a proposal to create tax-free areas to attract manufacturers to long-abandoned industrial areas. Underscoring the importance the mayor is placing on African-American support, on Friday he gained the backing of the Rev. James Meeks, a former state senator and head of the large Salem Baptist Church on the Far South Side. Four years earlier, during a short-lived mayoral bid, Meeks ripped Emanuel on WVON-AM 1690. \"If hes never done anything for African-Americans, wake up people. What would make us think hes going to sail into town and start doing things for us now?\", But on Friday, Meeks pulled an about-face. \"You cannot turn a city like Chicago around in four years. It takes longer,\" Meeks said. \"We appreciate the job that the mayor has been doing and we believe that he deserves four more years to continue his work.\", The Meeks endorsement does not come without risks for Emanuel, particularly among social liberals. Meeks was an outspoken opponent of the states gay marriage law and even taped automated phone calls to black households criticizing legalization. Earlier he labeled homosexuality an \"evil sickness.\", Meeks also endorsed Republican Bruce Rauner, and the new governor later named Meeks chairman of the Illinois State Board of Education. The gay rights group Equality Illinois was sharply critical of Rauners appointment of Meeks. At the same time, the group has backed Emanuels re-election. The group did not respond to a request for comment on whether the Meeks endorsement affected its backing of the mayor. As he tries to appeal to black voters, Emanuel has employed the twin themes hes used to pitch all voters: Hes the candidate with specific plans and programs and hes a political tough guy who doesnt always listen well, but hes working on it. During a visit to Cedar Concepts, a Back of the Yards plant the mayors office said is the nations only chemical manufacturing company owned by an African-American woman, Emanuel said the working-class neighborhood needs to market its strengths. \"Every area of the city has strengths. We have to have a strategy, know how to mobilize it, market it and then bring to bear the public ability to lift that area up and create economic opportunity,\" he said. But Emanuel, who often has answers to policy questions at the ready, displayed a rare moment at Cedar Concepts in acknowledging he doesnt have all the solutions. Asked by one of the attendees about potential infrastructure improvements related to the railroads, Emanuel responded: \"Thats our homework assignment to come out of here. ... I dont have the answer to that.\", Garcia often has acknowledged on the campaign trail that he doesnt have all the answers, but hes stressed that unlike Emanuel, he cares about all of the citys neighborhoods, which he argues have been \"left behind\" by City Hall. While Garcia could not boast much prominent black support before the first round, hes since picked up support from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, U.S. Rep. Danny Davis, former Illinois Senate President Emil Jones Jr. and businessman Willie Wilson, who finished third and won about 25 percent of the black vote Feb. 24. Historical tensions, Garcias effort to try to create a movement and momentum in the black community in a short time represents a bit of a double-edged sword. A former alderman, Garcia notes that he was a City Council ally of the late Harold Washington, the citys first black mayor and a leading historic figure of a generation ago. While older African-American voters may consider Garcias link to Washington a valuable political asset, its also older black voters who may still harbor some resentment toward the growth of the Latino community and its effect on jobs and contracts. Ald. Roderick Sawyer said Garcia does have to overcome skepticism that some black voters have toward Hispanics, but he said the Cook County commissioner has taken the right steps to be visible in the right neighborhoods. \"I think its horrible, but there is in a certain segment of the community a rift between blacks and Mexicans in particular. I dont subscribe to it. I think its racist and horrible, but it exists out there,\" said Sawyer, who isnt backing a mayoral candidate. \"People should not even talk about that rift any longer, but people do, and I believe they have an agenda,\" Sawyer said, \"because sometimes people dont want different groups to get together, because when they do, they become powerful.\", Garcia acknowledges there are challenges to reaching out to black voters as a Mexican-American. Still, he said that effort has \"not been as difficult as I expected. Ive found people to be very receptive.\", The challenger has portrayed Emanuels school closings as a modern kind of inequality, with shuttered buildings falling disproportionately in African-American communities. While he acknowledges those neighborhoods have endured large population losses, he insists the schools should have remained open because they often served as a lone center of community and source of jobs in impoverished neighborhoods. \"Abandoned buildings, coupled with abandoned schoolhouses that once represented vibrancy, that represented hope, that represented a real spirit for community people to rally around, are now shuttered,\" Garcia said at a recent news conference outside a vacant school building. \"So what I vow to this community is that I will listen. Thats the type of disposition that someone who wants to be leader of the city of Chicago ought to have.\", Crunching numbers, Sawyers 6th Ward, which includes Englewood, West Englewood and Chatham, provides an example of how support for Emanuel has fallen among black voters. Four years ago, Emanuel got 8,947 votes in winning the ward. Last month, Emanuel won the ward, but his total was cut nearly in half, to 4,703 votes  the largest drop-off of votes for the mayor of any majority-African-American ward in the city. As an indication of whats at stake for the candidates, the citys 18 majority-African-American wards accounted for about 40 percent of the ballots cast for mayor in February, the Tribune found, up about 4 percentage points compared with 2011. Yet turnout in those wards was down from the last mayoral race, as was the case citywide. Turnout declines were particularly heavy in the six wards with the citys highest percentage of black population, where voter participation dropped by nearly 21 percent from four years ago. In his first election, Emanuel avoided a runoff in part by winning nearly 60 percent of the vote in majority-African-American majority wards. But in last months balloting, Emanuel support in black-majority wards had fallen significantly, to almost 43 percent. Garcia, meanwhile, collected about a quarter of the vote in those wards. In raw numbers, Emanuels vote total in those wards fell from 122,561 four years ago to 79,284. Emanuel can point to the endorsement of his former boss, President Barack Obama, efforts to bring the Obama presidential library to the city and the backing of Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White and U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, who had long feuded with Emanuel and had backed a rival candidate last time. But there are questions about whether those endorsements will turn into votes. Catherine Beck, 91, a retired Chicago Public Schools teacher who took part in a recent Tribune poll, said she is undecided in the mayors race but said Obamas support of Emanuel will be on her mind. \"He is wise,\" Beck, an Englewood resident, said of Obama. \"And it will affect me when I go to the polls.\", Greg Harris, 54, a former Chicago police officer from Calumet Heights, said Garcias work with Washington appeals to him, as does Garcias ethnicity. \"Hes a minority just like Im a minority,\" said Harris, an African-American. \"He can relate to a minority because he knows what we need.\", Harris said he voted for Emanuel last month because he did not think anyone else on the ballot had a shot of winning. Since Garcia forced Emanuel into a runoff, Harris said he has been leaning toward voting for the challenger. State Sen. Kwame Raoul, a prominent African-American lawmaker from Hyde Park, said the candidates efforts to forge a linkage to prominent black leaders  whether its Emanuels ties to Obama or Garcias to Washington  shouldnt overshadow the need for candidates to speak to real neighborhood concerns. \"Just the reliance on the coattails of other people, I find that personally insulting to the black community in lieu of talking about the substantive issues of interest in the community,\" Raoul said. In a Tribune poll earlier this month, 71 percent of African-American voters said Obamas endorsement of Emanuel had no impact on their vote. Asked if Garcias ties to Washington would affect their balloting, 70 percent of black voters said it wouldnt. Those numbers mirrored the citywide response. Only 18 percent of black voters said they would be more likely to vote for Garcia because of his connections to the late mayor and only 16 percent said theyd be more likely to cast a ballot for Emanuel because of Obamas endorsement. The president came to Chicago to deliver a high-profile endorsement of Emanuel just five days before the February election. A major question for April 7 will be turnout in the black community, absent an African-American contender for mayor. Of the 18 African-American-majority wards, eight also have aldermanic runoff elections that could generate greater turnout than in the wards that have only the mayoral contest on the ballot. Six aldermen are involved in those runoffs, all of them Emanuel allies who got assistance from an Emanuel-aligned super political action committee. But much of that is far from the minds of most voters, including Webb, who owns that lonely casket business on South Halsted. Webb said he voted for Emanuel four years ago, largely because of Obamas endorsement and a sense of dissatisfaction with the tenure of Mayor Richard M. Daley. Now Webb has a \"Chuy\" sign taped in his storefront window and is sold on the candidates neighborhood-centric message. \"Richard J. Daley did wonders for downtown Chicago. Jane Byrne and the rest of them did the same. Richie Junior did the same thing,\" said Webb, 68, noting that his street has seen little development since riots that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s that led to white flight and burned and abandoned properties. \"The point Im trying to make is, nothing has been done in the neighborhoods.\", Tribune reporter Bill Ruthhart contributed. rap30@aol.com, cdizikes@tribpub.com, jjperez@tribpub.com]", "Date": "20150321", "Title": "[African-American vote could be key to Chicago mayoral election]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com//news/local/politics/ct-chicago-mayor-african-american-voters-met-0322-20150321-story.html\n", "Author": "[Rick Pearson, Cynthia Dizikes, Juan Perez Jr.]"}
{"Content": "[With Governors State University now a four-year college, and a new interchange to be completed at Interstate 57 and Stuenkel Road this fall, University Park should be ripe for economic development. But the matter of how to develop the village, bring down its high tax rate, and provide services to 5,500 university students has been a political football in recent years and is being tossed about now in a hotly contested mayoral race. Trustee Larry Brown, who is running against Mayor Vivian Covington and Trustee Joseph Roudez III in the April 7 election, collected enough signatures to put this issue to a vote via referendum. Voters will be asked: \"Shall University Park coordinate with Governors State University in the pursuit of retail/commercial development near the Metra train station?\", GSU spokeswoman Keisha Dyson said the university knew nothing about the referendum. \"Economic development in the region is always welcome,\" and as more people come to campus, interest will increase in local business, she said in an email response. The referendum never went before the village board, either, Covington said, claiming it is for \"political reasons.\", Roudez called it \"political nonsense.\", Referendum supporters, however, said it was necessary to send a message to the village board, which in 2012 voted down 4-3 a plan for commercial and residential development on a Stuenkel Road parcel, east of the Metra station. \"There is no economic development at GSU because they (a 4-3 majority bloc lead by Roudez) voted it down. We cannot do anything because they have the majority,\" said Trustee Milton Payton, one of the referendum supporters, who is also seeking re-election. Roudez bloc includes Trustees Oscar Brown and Elizabeth Williams  who are running for re-election on his slate  and Trustee Keith Griffin, the same four who voted for a salary increase for elected officials, effective after the April election. The minority of three consists of Mayor Covington, Trustees Larry Brown and Payton. \"In this election, we want to involve people and get them interested in this and find out whether they want us to work with GSU,\" Larry Brown said. \"Its not just GSU, but it would also involve the business community and residents so we can make the village what we all want it to be.\", He said he is not looking for a financial commitment from GSU, but wants input from President Elaine Maimon and her students. \"With GSU being a four-year college  this bolsters what we are trying to do,\" he said. \"With the new interchange, the Cicero corridor, Metra and GSU there is potential for growth. It is important to get people involved.\", One GSU student, Rita Smith, a junior from Homewood who lives on campus, said she would love to see a grocery store, clothing store and restaurants nearby. \"I dont have a car and I like to shop, but I hate having to go all the way to Orland Park,\" said Smith, who relies on carpooling to go shopping. There is no doubt the village needs revenue from economic development, Brown and Payton each said. \"We have the one of the highest tax rates in Will County. We have bare-bones services now and will have to cut those if we do not get more revenue. We need to do something,\" Payton said. \"We want people to tell the board this is the kind of thing they want.\", Covington said the village does not need a referendum to work collaboratively with GSU. It is \"misleading\" and \"irresponsible to make empty promises,\" she said. \"We already have a relationship,\" she said, adding that she meets regularly with Maimon and with other area mayors to collectively promote the region served by GSU. \"Were a college town now  this is good for the whole Southland area,\" Covington said. The village and the university reached an agreement last fall allowing the GSU golf team to use the village-owned University Park Golf Club as its home course, beginning with the 2015 golf season, she said. The university now serves as a catalyst for economic development by employing more than 1,000 people and providing programs to prepare students to join a highly skilled labor force, Dyson said. GSU also has a Small Business Development Center to develop, finance and improve the business community through professional services and training, and to develop public and private partnerships to support all aspects of entrepreneurial development, she said. Roudez said the referendum \"forces (the village) to have a relationship with GSU. Neither of us owns the land,\" he said, adding that he is \"insulted\" by the referendum. He would like to discuss a joint effort to build a multi-use sports facility for students and the community. GSU is \"not going to sit still,\" he said. \"President Maimon knows we need places for students to go. We are laid out perfectly to build an economic powerhouse. This is the time  right now.\", Roudez said he also believes that a \"great economic development tool\" would be a marijuana cultivation center. The village board considered a few firms, but none were granted a state license. Roudez has called upon local legislators to review the licenses and reconsider issuing a license to one firm that he supported. \"It would create jobs and revenue,\" he said. \"It would be a great enhancement to the people of University Park.\", slafferty@tribpub.com]", "Date": "20150320", "Title": "[Development near GSU is a political football]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com//suburbs/daily-southtown/news/ct-sta-gsu-develop-st-0318-20150320-story.html\n", "Author": "[Susan DeMar Lafferty]"}
{"Content": "[The Lockport Chamber of Commerce is not a \"shadowy organization\" as some critics have implied, and it plans to become more active in the city this year, according to chamber officials. Chamber president Pete Colarelli, whos also the 1st Ward alderman, said some city officials have used the organization as a \"political football,\" especially after it lost about $150,000 on a 2012 rock concert. But he acknowledged that the chamber needs to do more to promote itself and engage with residents and business owners. In January, Aaron Farmer, vice president of Mississippi-based Retail Coach, which the city hired for $40,000 to evaluate Lockports retail environment,  told the city council that Lockport needs a stronger chamber of commerce. \"You couldve heard crickets when he said that,\" said Ald. Kelly Turner, 2nd Ward, one of the chambers most vocal critics. The chambers financial woes began in August 2012 when it sponsored the Log Jam Concert featuring classic rock legends Eddie Money, Survivor and The Doors. But heavy thunderstorms earlier that day kept away much of the crowd, and the chamber suffered a large loss on the event. The chamber had purchased rain insurance for the concert, but it did not apply to rain earlier in the day, said Andy Coyle, a chamber director and former president. Turner said he became concerned about the citys stake in the venture and questioned how much taxpayer money was going to the chamber. He contended that the city paid $25,000 for police and staff time in connection with the concert. However, Lockport contributed only about $1,705 for Log Jam, according to information obtained by the Daily Southtown from the citys finance department through Illinois freedom of information law. Turner said the city council was close to forcing the chamber board to present its financial records before a new council was elected in 2013 and the will to do that waned. Colarelli, who is government and public affairs manager for the Citgo refinery in Lemont, said the chamber had a public meeting after Log Jam when it revealed its financial records, and Turner was welcome to attend but did not. He said he believes Turner was using the chamber and the concert loss as a political issue in 2012 and early 2013 because his 2013 mayoral opponent, Steve Streit, had been involved with the chamber. Streit defeated Turner in that election. Turner said no member businesses have been listed on the chambers website for some time. The website does include a \"membership directory\" link, but the page is listed as under construction. The website does include other information, such as a listing of its board of directors and a calendar featuring past and upcoming business and community special events. Turner is not along in his criticism of the chambers operations and leadership.  \"You never see them (current chamber board) do anything,\" Dan Rakowski, a past president of the chamber, said. \"Its just not a viable organization like it used to be anymore.\", He said before he left the chamber about four years ago it had about 325 members, but that number has dropped by about 100. Rakowski said he believes the chamber needs a change in leadership. \"You cannot have a politician running the chamber,\" he said, referring to Colarelli. \"You cannot mix politics and business.\", Colarelli is not running for re-election next month and said hes committed to running the chamber. As for the declining membership, Colarelli said the current board has cleaned up the roster and eliminated businesses that had closed or were no longer paying dues. \"Our goal was to have that be an honest number,\" he said of membership. The organization has held several events in recent months, including three ribbon-cutting ceremonies for new businesses since the end of December. One ribbon-cutting was for Perfect Shape Fitness in February. Its owner, Tim Gaba, said about 30 people came, including Streit, and he has seen a \"lot of good things from the chamber so far. It was a really nice event for us, especially being new to the area.\", Since incurring the debt from Log Jam, the chamber has kept active by sponsoring events but was not able to afford a full-time executive director to manage daily operations and give the chamber more visibility in the community, Colarelli said. But he said the chamber is finally close to paying off that debt, and he expects it to begin supplementing the citys economic development efforts, which he said would be crucial, especially if state budget cuts stretch Lockports resources thin.

{"Content": "[Stunned by shootings: Has it reached the point in this country where the governor of Wisconsin and the mayor of Madison have to apologize to the parents of the black man who was shot by the police officer because he attacked the police officer, yet its okay for people in Ferguson to riot and shoot officers in the face and chest? Oh well, thats what this country is coming to. Third world. Get used to it. Sounds of spring: The temperature is milder, the snow is finally melting, and the cars are already blaring their loud music. Welcome to warm weather in Elgin. Republicans missing at Selma: Hello, Speak Out. I would like to ask what has become of my Republican friends and neighbors on the subject of Selma. The newspaper is full of news about Selma, but I didnt see any of them going there or speaking about it. I wonder if they have taken an oath or perhaps there is a code of silence. Rising real estate taxes: I see the people in Kane County are going to get a real estate tax bump up. Our lousy officials who are running this state ought to be fired, from the lowest office worker to the top executive. Funny how it never works that taxes go down. They always go up. They assumed that everything was going well. You should not assume anything when taxpayers money is involved. Lets get rid of this whole crowd. We have an election coming up. For anyone who is for cutting taxes, give them your vote. Never mind the rest. Turned off by utility company: I hope you appreciate the frugality of the utility company. When you get your utility bill from ComEd, remember that the CEO only gets $2.5 million. And Exelon, which owns ComEd, has its CEO earning $17 million. I hope you appreciate their frugality. Heroin heartbreak: This is about heroin and its effect on families. My sons ex-wife destroyed her family. She didnt work for 12 years. She stole jewelry, and she stole from me. Last time I saw her, she only weighed 80 pounds. She looked like a skeleton. This was a girl who was once beautiful. She chose heroin over her husband and two boys. The kids are going through hell. The 15-year-old is rebellious. This has taken such a toll on my health. We warned my son not to get involved with this woman. Now hes raising their sons. What a life. Keep a close eye on your family and warn them. Care for the kids: After I read the story about the slain teenager, I was more concerned for the four children living in a house that was shot at two times in four months. Children learn what they live. Why wasnt Department of Children & Family Services called in to take those children out of such a dangerous environment?, Roused about Republicans: What is wrong with the Republicans? They are undermining the president. Total disrespect. I have never seen anything like this in the history of the United States. Is this man hated this much? What is Benjamin Netanyahu doing over here? What does he hold over the Republicans? This is the same thing he did with Iraq. He convinced the United States that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. He was set on fighting with Iraq. If the Republicans win the presidency, God help us all. Frustrated about Ferguson: I would like to comment on Ferguson, Missouri. I think I have the perfect solution. All the white police officers should just quit and find jobs in other places. All the white businesses that were burnt down should just be left as they are. All the white residents should just get up and leave and move somewhere else. In about a year, Ferguson will probably look like Detroit. They dont quite understand whats going on. If the guy had just gotten off the street, none of this would have happened. Vote for candidates who can cut it: Elgin city council candidates do battle? There should be no battle. Everyone should just cut taxes and payrolls. Let these people who go to the Hemmens and who go swimming and play golf pay for it so the taxpayers who dont use it dont have to pay for it. The library is another thing. The library is just fine the way it is. Less people are using it because everything now is either handheld or on your television or computer. Lets get going on cutting these salaries and pensions. Dont argue about how to spend it. Argue about how to cut it. All of it. Skewed view: Its amazing. There is nothing in the newspaper today about the shooting of police officers in Ferguson until page 27. But if some thug gets shot after attacking a cop, its all over the front page news. Maybe thats half the problem. The media in this country sensationalizes stories on a tilt. The media should really take a look in the mirror and see what angle they are reporting the news on. It might change things a little bit. Retaliation situation: Well, look whats happening in Ferguson. Two policemen were shot. Thank God they werent killed. Its a hate crime, but you dont see the white people in Ferguson or nationwide marching or looting. Its called dealing with things in a civilized way. Not stealing. Of course the police are scared to death because of retaliation. Retaliation for what? He committed armed robbery two hours earlier and tried to get the policemans gun. What is not to understand? Its called self-defense. The basic line is the boy broke the law. Someone has to recognize whats right and whats wrong. Steer clear of religious war: Regarding our role in the Middle East, I think we should stay out of it. These people have been fighting each other for a thousand years. One group doesnt like the other group. Its all about religion. They will never get along. We dont belong in the middle of a religious war, and thats exactly whats going on over there. We should stay out of it. Governor guts spending: Thank God we have a governor that says no overspending while we have an enormous debt in Illinois. Democrats have run Illinois into the ground with their overspending ways. Finally we have a governor who has the courage to do what needs to be done despite his critics. Keep up the good work, governor. If you run again, Ill vote for you. Save instead of spend: Im reading the article about the forest preserves and park districts having to suspend work after Governor Rauners decision to suspend funding. It blows my mind to read what some of these forest preserves are spending. There really shouldnt be a need to spend on forest preserves. You buy it to preserve it, but they feel they have to totally redo it. They cut trees down and put up buildings. Everything that is totally against what a forest preserve is supposed to be. They should buy these properties and leave them alone. The park districts are another story, but Im sure they could fund things through other alternatives. Its about time that people think about how government just throws money away on a daily basis instead of whining about not being able to spend it anymore. Fraud needs to be outlawed: Do all short order restaurants and pizza parlors pay their employees under the table so the employees dont have to show it as income? They then dont have to pay have taxes on the income but can file for financial government support. How does the proprietor file his taxes if he doesnt show the wages? Something doesnt seem kosher about this way of doing business. Maybe its time that these businesses are audited. How do trade companies get away with paying cash to their employees and never declaring it as income? Ones who are guilty of this are lawn services, carpenters and painters. I dont understand how the owners of these businesses pay their taxes. There is a lot of fraud going on in this country, and the taxpayers are being hurt by it. This really needs to be investigated. Dont blame Obama: I would like to say that what Rudy Guiliani said about President Obama has a very racist tone. Everyone wants to blame everything on the president. The fact is that America, under the guidance of former President George Bush, invaded Iraq. The Israeli prime minister also had a hand in it. He said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The reason ISIS happened is because we invaded Iraq. Saddam Hussein had Iraq in check. When we took him out, the region became unstable. Wake up, America.

{"Content": "[Four years ago, controversial Rev. James Meeks skewered mayoral candidate Rahm Emanuel, saying he wasnt out for the best interests of black voters. \"Ask any African-American leaders about that. They will tell you he had a role in keeping African-Americans out of the White House. All of the sudden, he sails into town, into African-American communities with all of this great stuff hes going to do for us,\" Meeks said during a talk show on WVON-AM 1690 at the time. \"Your proof is in your track record. If hes never done anything for African-Americans, wake up people. What would make us think hes going to sail into town and start doing things for us now?\", But on Friday, Meeks stood side by side with Emanuel, endorsing him and saying hes made a difference in black communities. \"You cannot turn a city like Chicago around in four years, it takes longer,\" Meeks said in a resounding speech. \"We appreciate the job that the mayor has been doing and we believe that he deserves four more years to continue his work.\", Emanuel, pressing hard to appeal to black voters, a demographic that could make the difference in his April 7 election against challenger Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia, accepted Meeks backing. \"I am honored by your support. Im humbled by it,\" Emanuel told a gathering of religious leaders. \"But as I said earlier, while this is about the election, I want us to keep our eye on the prize, which is the day after the election and working together building the city of Chicago.\", It was an about-face for Meeks, who was highly critical of Emanuel as the former state senator and South Side pastor mulled his own run for mayor at the end of 2010. Meeks pulled the plug, then backed former U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley Braun for mayor, arguing that a vote for Emanuel was a vote for the status quo. \"Thats why this election is the ins versus the outs. Those who are in, those who are in power, those who are in control of City Hall, they have surrounded the presumptive front-runner and they are giving him money, hand over fist, to make sure that he continues to keep business as usual,\" Meeks said in the WVON interview. \"Those of you who are listening, who want business as usual, thats your candidate.\", By accepting Meeks endorsement, Emanuel could run the risk of alienating gay voters, who have been a consistent base of support. Meeks long has been opposed to same-sex marriage, drawing protest from gay rights activists. Meeks was appointed by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner to be chairman of the Illinois State Board of Education. Though the pastor was confirmed by the state Senate this week, gay rights supporters criticized Rauners appointment of Meeks, citing the pastors same-sex marriage stance. \"We had hoped and expected Rev. Meeks to use the more than two months since his appointment to reflect on and make amends with the LGBT community and other groups for his hurtful and destructive actions,\" said Bernard Cherkasov, CEO of Equality Illinois. \"Instead, weve seen nothing tangible from him.\", During the legislatures debate over Illinois same-sex marriage law two years ago, Meeks recorded automated phone calls to African- American households warning that marriage between a man and a woman was in jeopardy. During his brief mayoral candidacy in late 2010, Meeks faced criticism over previous comments that homosexuality was an \"evil sickness.\", Meeks also is a strong supporter of charter schools, a concept opposed by the Chicago Teachers Union, a leading advocate for Garcias candidacy. Garcia, a former state senator and alderman, favors a moratorium on new charter schools and is a supporter of same-sex marriage. Much has been made of Emanuels friendship with Rauner that started over a business deal and eventually led to the two taking vacation trips together. That hasnt stopped Emanuel from slamming Rauners proposed budget cuts in recent days as being wrong for Chicago. The mayor reiterated that stance Friday, and Meeks was asked to reconcile his role as a top Rauner lieutenant with his endorsement of Emanuel. \"The mayor and the governor will have their own relationship, and that has absolutely nothing to do with me,\" Meeks said. \"I expect both gentlemen to work together for the betterment of the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago.\", Meeks endorsement came at a Pullman community center in which Emanuel touted the support of a dozen black ministers. Meeks is head of one of the citys largest African-American churches, Salem Baptist Church on the Far South Side. It isnt the first time Emanuel has embraced the support of a foe who had harsh words four years ago. International Operating Engineers Local 150 President James Sweeney has been a key union backer in Emanuels bid for a second term. But in 2011, Sweeney lined up behind Gery Chico for mayor, worried that labor couldnt trust Emanuel after he helped former President Bill Clinton pass the North American Free Trade Agreement two decades earlier. Sweeney even called Emanuel a \"Wall Street Judas,\" which Emanuel allies decried as anti-Semitic. Also Friday, Garcia touted the endorsement of freshman state Rep. Will Guzzardi, whose election win last year has made him a darling of some liberals. Garcias event took place near McCormick Place, site of a planned new hotel that liberals have decried because the project is financed in part by tens of millions of dollars in special tax district funds they say should be going to schools and other neighborhood projects. On hand for the Guzzardi endorsement were representatives of Reclaim Chicago, a group of labor unions and other grass-roots organizations that has claimed credit for helping liberal aldermanic candidates score wins and push incumbents into runoffs. \"These are the people who work day in and day out in some of Chicagos most challenging neighborhoods,\" Garcia said. \"They understand what the real priorities of the city need to be, if fairness and equity are going to become the order of the day.\", While hes trying to fire up his base, Garcia is also attempting to close his steep funding deficit against the well-financed Emanuel. The Guzzardi endorsement came a day after Garcia traveled to Los Angeles for two fundraisers. \"Over the past two weeks, Ive received endorsements from a host of spiritual leaders, community leaders, and the most important networks of organizers are all standing with me,\" Garcia said. Guzzardi criticized the hotel construction site backdrop as a failure of so-called trickle-down economics. \"We deserve more than just a trickle. We need justice flowing like water, righteousness like a mighty stream,\" Guzzardi shouted. \"We are living in food deserts and mental health deserts and school deserts. We need more than a trickle, we need a flood of investment and resources. Rahm Emanuel doesnt understand that, Chuy Garcia does.

{"Content": "[For the first time in the two decades since Chicago switched to nonpartisan mayoral elections, the race is going the distance. None of the five candidates won a majority in the Feb. 24 primary, setting up this historic April 7 runoff between Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia. Our choice in February was Emanuel. It still is. Over the last four years, Chicagoans have gained a warts-and-all familiarity with Emanuel. Weve seen him make tough decisions and take unpopular steps to stem the citys financial slide and build a vibrant business environment. More Chicagoans are working. The public schools and community colleges are on a better course. What hes done gives us confidence in what hell do. And Garcia? Weve always admired his political independence and basic decency. With the race down to two candidates, we looked forward to getting a better sense of what hed do as mayor. But that picture hasnt come into focus. Garcia has zigged and zagged on some hot-button issues. He pledged to take down the citys red light cameras, then said hed leave some up, then said theyd all come down on \"day one.\" He has meandered in his stance on where hed allow a Barack Obama presidential library. On crucial questions of how hed repair the citys finances, Garcia has been worse than inconsistent. He has offered no clues at all. Where would he find the $120 million to hire 1,000 new police officers? How would he replace the $70 million generated each year by the red light cameras? How would the city come up with that looming $550 million payment to its police and fire pension funds? What about the $700 million due for teacher pensions? What possible sources of new revenue are on  or off  the table? What would Garcia ask union employees to give up to help rescue their retirement funds, and whats his Plan B for when they say no?, Garcia is asking voters to mark their ballots for him without knowing any of that. Just take it on faith that the committee hell appoint the day after the election will tell him what to do 90 days later. As if Chicago can afford to put those critical moves on hold for even another day. This campaign is more than four months old. The information needed to make these decisions is readily available. Why is Garcia still waffling? As a candidate, he clearly has trouble making decisions and delivering bad news. As mayor, you could expect more of the same from him. Theres no such uncertainty with Emanuel. What you see is what you get. You might not like all of the decisions hes made, but he made them. And Chicago is, on balance, better off. The city is not where it needs to be, but its moving in the right direction.

{"Content": "[Illinois 17 year olds want freedom more than any other group of people under the age of retirement  and they are back in Springfield, demanding more. And, with statistics that show what that voting block has been up to, legislators are listening closer than ever. The Suffrage at 17 law, championed in 2013 by Stevenson High School teachers and students, has a little brother working its way through the General Assembly, which would give more teenagers the right to begin voting before they turn 18. Andrew Conneen, SHSs Advanced Placement government teacher and Political Action Club co-sponsor, spent years pushing his original bill before then-Gov. Pat Quinn signed it. The new measure, though, came from a meeting that involved of one of his club members. \"Its incredible,\" said Rachel Aranyi, the freshman from Buffalo Grove who Conneen called the driving force behind the new effort. \"People like to marginalize us, and make fun of our movies or our music, but we have a vote.\", \"Shes a one-of-a-kind kid,\" Conneen said. The Suffrage at 17 law allows citizens whose 18th birthdays occur in the calendar space between a state or federal primary election (held in the spring) and the general election in early November to have a say, while at age 17, in which candidate a party will put on the final ballot. The bill affects just a small percentage of the teen population  even in the brief two-year term of a representative, only a fraction of new voters will turn 18 after the primary but before the general but Conneen and Political Action Club members fought for years to make it happen, picking up support from state Rep. Carol Sente (D-Vernon Hills) and state Sen. Terry Link (D-Waukegan) that led to its passage. On July 3, 2013, Quinn came to Lincolnshire to sign the bill on SHSs football field. Big as it was, though, no one noticed at the time that it overlooked one genuinely small detail: townships. The most local level of partisan politics was unaffected by Suffrage at 17. \"I dont know how it was left out,\" Conneen said. \"My understanding is that this is unusual, to go back and clean up previous legislation.\", Thus, the creation in this legislative session of House Bill 3145, written by Sente. The new measure would allow 17 year olds who would turn 18 by the general to vote in \"consolidated primary elections,\" which are primaries for townships, and the few municipalities that allow partisan politics. \"It was always the plan to have all of it together,\" Sente said. \"It really was a little bit of an oversight that we didnt get it included the first time.\", Townships are the level of government between the county and municipalities. They often maintain a few roads, provide senior-citizen services and fill in other gaps. Voter turnout for those elections is almost always poor. Aranyi said she was meeting with Sente months ago when the subject came up. Aranyi and fellow Buffalo Grove freshman Maya Parekh are trying to establish the first high school-level chapter of the womens leadership group Lean In, and they spoke with Sente about their idea. Aranyi said it was Sente who brought up the lack of township-level coverage in the Suffrage at 17 law, and the topic grabbed Aranyis attention. The Lincolnshire, Buffalo Grove and Long Grove area is mostly overseen by Vernon Township. Vernon supervisor Bill Peterson, a Republican, said he has never faced a challenger for township control from within his own party. When he served as a state senator, he nearly had to run in primaries twice. \"They never made it on the ballot, because one guy did not collect enough signatures on his petition, and the other guy, I forget what happened to him,\" Peterson said of his General Assembly days. He said he hoped to see Suffrage at 17 extended to the level he now operates on. \"I certainly support it,\" Peterson said. \"Most of the enthusiastic campaign workers Ive had were high school juniors and seniors.\", After the first bills passage, Cook County held a registration drive for 17 year olds who would turn 18 after the March 18, 2014, state and federal primaries. Records show that more than 7,000 responded in time. And while that cold days turnout was anemic overall, about 15 percent of the new laws beneficiaries took advantage of it  better than their parents. Consolidated elections happen on odd years. Should HB 3145 pass the legislature and be signed by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, it would effect the primaries in the spring of 2017. Conneen said he was confident Rauner would sign the bill, should it make it to his desk, which would complete the new freedoms that some 17 year olds are able to use. \"This really affects our most local of local governments,\" he said. It could have a committee hearing in the next few weeks, and Aranyi said she is lobbying legislators to approve it. She is not working toward her own benefit  her 18th birthday is not in the affected calendar space  but she cited studies showing that the younger a person begins to vote, the more likely they are to participate in civics habitually. \"Theyll be lifelong voters,\" she said. \"If you just stand idly by and watch whats happening in your country, you wont make anything happen.\", rwachter@pioneerlocal.com]", "Date": "20150320", "Title": "[Suffrage at 17 could expand to township primaries]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com//suburbs/buffalo-grove/news/ct-lsr-suffrage-tl-0326-20150320-story.html\n", "Author": "[Ronnie Wachter]"}
{"Content": "[Kaneland School District 302 voters will find a slightly different lineup of candidates on the ballot when they go into the voting booth on April 7. Eight candidates are vying for four open seats on the Kaneland School Board. The incumbents seeking re-election are Peter Lopatin, Gale Pavlak, Tony Valente and Teresa Witt, while the newcomers are Jerry Elliot, Dan Nagel, Ryan Kerry and Pam Voorhees. The Kane County States Attorneys Office confirmed Thursday the ballot was changed from what appeared on a sample ballot in a recent Kane County Voter Information Guide. Kaneland District 302 is a rural district with the voting results based on a balanced representation of all or part of eight townships in Kane and DeKalb counties. The School Board cannot have more than three members represented from any one township and five candidates are running from Sugar Grove Township. Valente, Nagel, Elliott, Lopatin and Witt reside in Sugar Grove Township; Kerry resides in Campton Township; Pavlak lives in Blackberry Township; and Voorhees is in Pierce Township. Three board members not up for election next month live in two different townships. Board President Cheryl Krauspe lives in Campton Township, while Pedro Riva and Veronica Bruhl reside in Blackberry Township. Kane County Assistant States Attorney Erin Gaeke said upon a request to review statutes for the Illinois Election Code and Illinois School Code for ballot position, it was decided the candidates would be grouped by townships and the order in which they filed. \"There was ambiguity in reviewing both of the codes,\" Gaeke said. She said the revision to group candidates by township will give voters a clearer idea of where the candidates reside. The original sample ballot listed the candidates based on a lottery. \"We determined the way the ballot is now is the best place to have them listed,\" the assistant states attorney said. Three candidates have different placement on the revised ballot. Lopatin and Witts names were moved up to the fourth and fifth spots on the ballot. Kerry was moved from the fourth to sixth spot and Pavlak was moved down from the sixth to the seventh spot on the ballot. Suzanne Fahnestock, Kane County chief deputy clerk, said other than having to shift the candidates names to group them by township the ballot is essentially the same. \"It was too late for us to change the publication,\" Fahnestock said about the published Voter Information Guide.

{"Content": "[ Editors Note: Speak Out is a reader-generated column of opinions. If you see something you disagree with or think is incorrect, please tell us! Call us at 312-222-2460. Alcohol versus marijuana: We demonize marijuana, but we glamorize alcohol. A lot of people smoke marijuana, but they smoke it inside their homes. Alcohol can be consumed just about anywhere, and it is okay. At presidential balls and governor balls, alcohol is always served. Alcohol kills more than any drug in America, whether through car accidents or barroom brawls. A young man has been convicted of killing a teacher in Naperville in a bar. It all happened in a drinking establishment. You dont see people smoking marijuana and fighting each other. Alcohol makes people violent and causes heart disease and cancer, yet we advertise it on television and in magazines. Dont you think our kids see this? Look at the frat parties. Kids out of control and drinking. We took cigarette ads out of magazines and television. Alcohol kills more than cigarettes. Cigarettes never make you get in your car and kill someone. I leave it up to you. You weigh it out and see what you come up with. Zeroing in on heroin problem: I would like to speak about the heroin epidemic. I lived in Chicago during the 1960s and 1970s. The Latinos and the blacks in the inner city were overdosing left and right and dying from heroin. Nobody cared because they didnt think it would reach the white neighborhoods. Now it is out in the white neighborhoods, and were trying to do everything we can because its killing the white kids. Go figure. One just as bad as the other: I see a lot of people are complaining about Governor Rauner. For all the people who wanted so badly to get former Governor Quinn out, they will find that the grass is not always greener. Phase out performing pachyderms: Im one person who is happy that Ringling Bros. Circus is phasing out having elephants perform. No animal should be forced to perform like they do. They should be free to roam and enjoy life as God intended. Now lets hope other circuses will follow suit. Bummed about bridge: Im watching the ABC special on the bridge collapse in Minnesota a few years back. A giant four-lane highway bridge collapsed into the Mississippi River. They rebuilt that bridge in less than a year. They cant get that debacle at Route 20 and McLean Boulevard done in four years. Something is seriously wrong. Sticking up for shorter version: Am I the only one who liked the shortness of the old newspaper before it went back to the big thing? It was convenient to lay out on my table. I could see everything on it and have room for my coffee and my bowl of cereal. There is too much about Chicago in there. How about featuring some restaurants in Aurora?, Concern about old Copley Hospital: So the City of Aurora is demolishing Copley Hospital? That will be a nice expenditure of $10 million paid by the taxpayers. This building is important to many residents. Why wasnt it ever redeveloped? There was a senior living proposal presented in 1997, but it was to be voted down by the city council. They turned their back on a solid business plan with a sensible economic development incentive. At that time, the building was in good condition. Sadly, it is no longer. Over the past 20 years, why didnt the economic development department ever find a new developer? How about the professional preservationists? That group loves historic buildings. Why didnt the mayor and city council hire a competent consultant? There was enough time. Did everyone fail, or did anyone try? What a misplaced priority. Its easy to come up with incentives for newer sections of the city like the outlet mall and then congratulate each other at council meetings. Its harder to have success with older buildings with troubled ownership. We pay the mayor and his managers not to leave holes in our neighborhood and our hearts. Their failure with Copley makes me glad they will be shown the door in two years. Bobcat caught on camera: Can our news media describe anything that happens without saying what color the man was or what he had in his hand? I understand this bobcat was up in Wauconda. It was unarmed. I understand someone shot it with a camera. Was the guy doing the shooting black or white? Lets get it straight. A good t-shirt for Madison, Wisconsin, would read: Be Cool. Dont Be a Fool. Voter registration situation in Ferguson: Im calling about Anthony Stanfords good column on Ferguson, Missouri. I would like to point out an omission with regards to most coverage of Ferguson. What is happening with voter registration there? I suspect there is discrimination going on with voter registration as well otherwise the black majority would straighten out the situation at the polls. Republicans missing at Selma: Hello, Speak Out. I would like to ask what has become of my Republican friends and neighbors on the subject of Selma. The newspaper is full of news about Selma, but I didnt see any of them going there or speaking about it. I wonder if they have taken an oath or perhaps there is a code of silence. Rising real estate taxes: I see the people in Kane County are going to get a real estate tax bump up. Our lousy officials who are running this state ought to be fired, from the lowest office worker to the top executive. Funny how it never works that taxes go down. They always go up. They assumed that everything was going well. You should not assume anything when taxpayers money is involved. Lets get rid of this whole crowd. We have an election coming up. For anyone who is for cutting taxes, give them your vote. Never mind the rest. Turned off by utility company: I hope you appreciate the frugality of the utility company. When you get your utility bill from ComEd, remember that the CEO only gets $2.5 million. And Exelon, which owns ComEd, has its CEO earning $17 million. I hope you appreciate their frugality. Heroin heartbreak: This is about heroin and its effect on families. My sons ex-wife destroyed her family. She didnt work for 12 years. She stole jewelry, and she stole from me. Last time I saw her, she only weighed 80 pounds. She looked like a skeleton. This was a girl who was once beautiful. She chose heroin over her husband and two boys. The kids are going through hell. The 15-year-old is rebellious. This has taken such a toll on my health. We warned my son not to get involved with this woman. Now hes raising their sons. What a life. Keep a close eye on your family and warn them. Care for the kids: After I read the story about the slain teenager, I was more concerned for the four children living in a house that was shot at two times in four months. Children learn what they live. Why wasnt Department of Children & Family Services called in to take those children out of such a dangerous environment?, Roused about Republicans: What is wrong with the Republicans? They are undermining the president. Total disrespect. I have never seen anything like this in the history of the United States. Is this man hated this much? What is Benjamin Netanyahu doing over here? What does he hold over the Republicans? This is the same thing he did with Iraq. He convinced the United States that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. He was set on fighting with Iraq. If the Republicans win the presidency, God help us all. Frustrated about Ferguson: I would like to comment on Ferguson, Missouri. I think I have the perfect solution. All the white police officers should just quit and find jobs in other places. All the white businesses that were burnt down should just be left as they are. All the white residents should just get up and leave and move somewhere else. In about a year, Ferguson will probably look like Detroit. They dont quite understand whats going on.

{"Content": "[Lets start with this: A central premise of mayoral challenger Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcias new campaign ad on Chicago education is flat wrong. Garcia says Mayor Rahm Emanuel closed 50 elementary schools and \"he took the money from these schools and gave it to elite private schools founded by his big campaign contributors.\", The Chicago Public Schools system doesnt fund private schools, elite or otherwise. It does fund 131 charter schools. They are open-enrollment, tuition-free, public schools. Theyre run by organizations that contract with CPS. They are ultimately answerable to CPS. If they dont perform well, CPS can shut them down, just like any of the systems 664 schools (charters included). Garcia is right that some charter supporters have contributed to Emanuel. The guy is a human vacuum cleaner when it comes to campaign cash. The Tribune reported Thursday on one example: A company connected to former NBA star Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson has contributed $250,000 to Emanuels campaign this year, while last year another company connected to Johnson got an $80 million contract to provide custodial and other services to CPS. Its also true that many of the charter school operators in Chicago are nationally recognized education innovators. There is high demand from students and parents for Chicagos charter schools. So how would CPS be different under a Mayor Garcia?, Charter school expansion would be dead. He has promised to impose a moratorium. Rigorous assessment of student progress and teacher performance would be rolled back. Garcia promises the \"barest legal minimum\" of test assessments. In short, Chicago would trail the national movement to put high standards on school curriculum and make sure that teachers are teaching and students are learning. He would press the legislature to take away the mayors power to appoint the school board and shift to direct election of the board. That might be his most popular position, based on the results of referendums on an elected school board held in 37 wards in February. Wed argue, though, that Chicago should be wary of making that change. Who would really control the school board? Would every community be represented? Keep in mind that many schools cant even find enough candidates to fill out their Local School Councils. Would he reopen all those closed schools? While Garcia used the shuttered Marconi Elementary Community Academy on the West Side as a backdrop for his ad, he said during last weeks mayoral debate that he wont promise to reopen any of the closed schools. Thats a tacit acknowledgment that schools had to close. Which gets us to the most critical questions about CPS:, Will the system collapse before the first day of school in the fall?, Will CPS be able to open its doors?, Will the Illinois legislature have to permit the school system to file for federal bankruptcy protection?, CPS faces a staggering $1.1 billion deficit in its 2015-16 budget, including a nearly $700 million contribution to the teachers pension fund. CPS already has $9.5 billion in unfunded pension obligations. Garcia and Emanuel were asked about this in their debate last week. Voters couldnt take comfort in their answers. Emanuel said he is banking on finding pension relief. Hes counting on the Illinois Supreme Court to rule that the growth in pension obligations can legally be curbed. Hes counting on the Illinois General Assembly either to approve changes in the Chicago teachers pension system or to take the financial obligation for that system. The pension system for the rest of the states teachers now is under state control. Emanuel argues that, in fairness, the state should have the obligation for Chicagos teachers as well. And Garcia? Heres what he said when he was asked at the debate about that billion-dollar deficit:, \"I cant tell you right now how I would solve it. I can tell you I would have the finances of Chicago Public Schools audited so that the citizens know where the money has been going and what kind of risky investments members of the board have engaged in.\", I cant tell you right now how I would solve it. Thats an awfully familiar and troubling refrain from Garcia. We know what Garcia says, and doesnt say, about how he would change schools. We know that Emanuels Board of Education lengthened the school day, closed underused schools, extended prekindergarten and improved teacher and student assessments. We also know that Emanuels Board of Education irresponsibly postponed the financial reckoning until after this election by counting 14 months of revenue for this years 12-month budget. We know what we know. What we dont know is whether Chicagos school system will collapse in a matter of months. Chicago voters must decide whether Emanuel, or Garcia, will contend with this crisis.]", "Date": "20150319", "Title": "[Chuy, Rahm and the Chicago school crisis]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com//news/opinion/editorials/ct-garcia-cps-edit-0320-bd-20150319-story.html\n", "Author": "[Editorial Board]"}
{"Content": "[Big changes have come to fruition at Niles Township High School District 219 this year, with the school boards decision to adopt a new school calendar and change the way it prepares students for college coming under heavy scrutiny, and prompting a large pool of candidates to run in this years election. The school board this year has come under fire from parents and taxpayersmany of whom are angry about spending on unpopular programs and big changes made to the school calendar that cut summer break shorter by a week. The hotbed of issues circulating throughout the Skokie school district this election seasonnew multi-million dollar in-school health clinics, more school days in August, and what some have criticized as an exclusionary partnership with Skokie School District 69have boiled down to an intense school board race. Niles Township voters who are unhappy with the school boards recent decisions have the chance to enact change on April 7 when five of the seven seats on the board go up for grabs. A crowded field of candidates is vying for the four open full four-year terms on the Niles Township School District 219 board that will be filled in next months municipal election. There is one open seat for a two-year term. Carlton Evans, a current board member, is running unopposed for that seat. Eleven other candidates have filed to run for the remaining seats, which hold four-year terms. All four incumbents whose terms expire this year are fighting to keep their seats. They are Sheri Doniger, Jeff Greenspan, David Ko, and Eileen Valfer. The newcomers hoping to steal one of those seats are Jon Heinz, Lateef Farisa Hussain, Linda Lampert, Brian Novak, Franklin A. Sacks, Bennett Santana, and Mark Sproat. Past experience on the board gives the incumbents a natural edge above the newcomers, but the fresh candidates push for change has gained popularity among a solid following of parents who have shown their support at two recent candidate forums. Ten of the 12 candidates running for the school board attended the second of two forums on March 12 at Niles West High School. A crowd of nearly 100 people turned out to watch the two-hour forum, which was organized by the Niles North High School Parent Advisory Council and moderated by a panel of students. The students asked the board candidates to answer a series of questions about the school calendar, partnerships with the feeder districts, and spending. Many of the new candidates expressed similar opinions that the school board lacks transparency and should implement better communication policies that include parents in the decision-making process. One criticism of the current school board is that the Classrooms First Consolidation with Skokie School District 69 was made without the inclusion of parents and taxpayers. A newly-formed alliance of parents, teachers, and taxpayers from District 219 has endorsed four of the 12 candidates running for the school board. The formation of Progress 219an advocacy group of about 30 people who live and/or work in Niles Township School District 219stemmed from growing concerns among what the groups president Catherine Struzynski describes as concerns about a district-wide communication deficiency. Struzynski said that the group will not take sides on issues until after the election, but she did say that Progress219 plans to focus on creating better transparency and open dialogue within the school district. \"The first and foremost initiative after the election, is to see if theres a better process for community outreach,\" Struzynski said. A selection committee appointed by the Progress219 organization selected Lincolnwood educator Lateef Farisa Hussain, Skokie Chiropractor David Ko, attorney Brian Novak of Skokie, and vice president of Skokie Youth Sports, Mark Sproat. The general consensus among the newcomer candidates during the March 12 forum was that the board needs to do more to become better communicators with parents and taxpayers. \"Its very important that the board is involved with the community and involves them in decision-making,\" said Mark Sproat, the vice president of Skokie Youth Sports. Candidate Linda Lampert heavily criticized the school districts partnership with District 69 by accusing the school board of \"bullying the sender school districts.\", \"If you want change you need to vote new people onto the board,\" Lampert said. \"Were overburdened with too many big issues at this point, and the community needs to feel theyve been included instead of excluded.\", Candidate Franklin Sacks echoed Lamperts sentiments about the partnership with only one school district. \"The partnership is discriminatory,\" Sacks said. \"We need to take care of all our [feeder] districts, and parents should be able to trust youre doing the right things for the right reasons.\", Current board member Eileen Valfer defended the school boards decision to partner with District 69, claiming District 69 was the sole school district to bite the bait when Classrooms First was put on the table to all the school districts. \"We had to start somewherewe reached out to all nine feeder districts, and some didnt want anything to do with us,\" Valfer said. \"District 69 expressed the desire to work with us, but the money [were spending] isnt just going to District 69its going to the future of all District 219 students.\", Both candidate forums can be viewed on the school districts web site at http://www.niles-hs.k12.il.us/.

{"Content": "[What has gone wrong with the U.S. government in the past month? Just about everything, from the fundamental to the ridiculous. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the United States to warn Congress about the dangers of a nuclear Iran. He spoke without the invitation of an irritated President Obama, who claimed that he did not even watch the address on television. Obama declined to even meet with the Israeli prime minister, announcing that it would have been improper for him to have such a meeting so close to Netanyahus re-election bid. But if Obama was so concerned about not influencing the Israeli elections, why, according to some news accounts, is a Senate panel launching an investigation into whether Obamas State Department gave grant money to a nonprofit organization, the OneVoice Movement, that sought to unseat Netanyahu with the help of several former Obama campaign operatives?, Then, 47 Republican senators signed an unusual letter to the Iranian theocracy, reminding it that any agreement on Irans nuclear program negotiated with the Obama administration would have to first clear Congress. Obama shot back that the senators letter was undue interference that aided the Iranians. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton agreed that the senators were either empowering Iranian hardliners or sabotaging the diplomatic efforts of their own president. Secretary of State John Kerry concurred. Nonetheless, the Senate may well pass new sanctions against Iran, if it feels Obama has been too lax in its negotiations or usurped senatorial oversight of treaties. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J. bucked the Obama administration and expressed doubt about administration concessions to the Iranians. Other Democrats could join him. But almost immediately after weighing in on Iran, Menendez found himself the target of a federal investigation into purported corruption. And as far as the claim of improper interference in foreign affairs goes, the Obama administration and British Prime Minister David Cameron jointly lobbied U.S. senators not to pass tougher sanctions on Iran. Meanwhile, the aforementioned Hillary Clinton is bogged down in another trademark Clinton scandal. Clinton never used a standard government email account while secretary. And rather than submitting her actual emails to the State Department back in December, Clinton submitted 55,000 printed pages of emails -- making it much harder for those emails to be searched. Apparently, Clinton also wished to decide which of her private-server communications to release to the government -- but only when demanded by congressional investigators and watchdog groups well after her tenure ended. Clintons implausible press conference last week only made things worse. She proved unable to explain her unusual behavior and seemed ignorant about how government email works and is secured. Abroad, Syria, Iran and the Islamic State are battling for what is left of the Syrian-Iraqi borderlands after the United States abruptly pulled out all its peacekeepers from Iraq. All are enemies of the U.S. But as they fight each other, the Obama administration is negotiating with Iran over its efforts against the Islamic State. The administration has also expressed a willingness to meet with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, after not long ago declaring Assad an illegitimate leader who should step down. Obama had issued red-line threats to Assad over the gassing of his own people. Back home, two apparently inebriated Secret Service agents crashed their government car into a security barrier near the White House -- in the midst of an active bomb investigation. Indeed, the reckless agents may have crashed right through the crime scene. This is after the Department of Homeland Security launched an investigation into the culture of the Secret Service following a 2012 scandal in which a dozen agents hired prostitutes during an alcohol-fueled night in Colombia. Meanwhile, in the midst of nightly demonstrations at Ferguson, Missouri, a young demonstrator on parole allegedly shot two police officers. \"Whoever fired those shots shouldnt detract from the issue,\" the president editorialized. But trying to gun down a policeman should amount to something more than a \"detraction.\", Obamas own Department of Justice recently issued a report indicating that the Ferguson Police Department routinely violates the rights of black citizens. But the DOJ also found Officer Darren Wilsons shooting of a charging Michael Brown justifiable. That shooting was the incident that began the Ferguson \"issue\" in the first place. Was Obama worried about the wounded policemen \"detracting\" from the protestors \"hands up, dont shoot\" allegations, which Attorney General Eric Holders investigators, along with a grand jury, had already debunked?, All this chaos has taken amid ongoing IRS and VA investigations, the Supreme Courts impending decision on the constitutionality of Obamacare, and Saudi Arabia arranging to buy from South Korea nuclear expertise to counter Iran. The common thread in all this chaos?, More than the usual partisanship at home and barbarism abroad. No one seems to be in charge at the White House. And that has terrified Americas supporters and emboldened its enemies -- with another two years to go.

{"Content": "[Schock lost touch with average Illinoisan, U.S. Rep. Aaron Schocks decision to resign came as a surprise to many. Less than a year ago, Schock stood out as a rising GOP star with virtually limitless potential. He flirted with a race for governor in the lead up to the 2014 election and was rumored to be eyeing a U.S. Senate run at some point in the future. Schocks indiscretions can easily be misread as an indictment of a millennial generation overly consumed with celebrity and social media and playing fast and loose with ethics. However, this interpretation of the Peoria congressmans downfall leaves out the important lesson that voters should take away from Illinois latest political black eye. Schock, like so many other members of Congress, has a life far removed from the world where the rest of us live. He paid a political donor $750,000 for a warehouse in Peoria without thinking twice. To the congressman, there was nothing unusual about billing taxpayers more than $10,000 for private flights. All of this must have seemed normal to him. Thats the scary thing. The median wealth per adult in the United States sits at about $44,900. Schock entered Congress in 2009 at 27; his disclosed personal wealth was reported to be in a range centered on $1.4 million. Is it any wonder Schock didnt have the good sense not to spend $40,000 of his official budget to redecorate his office in the theme of PBS \"Downton Abbey?\", The lesson to learn from Aaron Schock is not that he was too young to serve, its that he wasnt in touch with the economic reality of most Americans. Voters will be less disappointed if they elect leaders who are of the middle class, so that those leaders will be more likely for the middle class. Joe Carlasare, Joliet, President, Young Democrats of Illinois, Reeder comparison inaccurate, Once again, columnist Scott Reeder misleads the public in an effort to persuade readers to his point of view but fails to do a good job of doing that. He does say correctly that no constitutional right is absolute (something that other conservatives may disagree with regarding things like the 2nd Amendment). But comparing the promise/commitment of the pension protection clause in our state constitution to the First Amendment, or any constitutional right, is like comparing apples to watermelons. Hes right in saying that yelling \"fire\" in a crowded theater is not protected free speech and that speech, like any right, is limited, but violating a specific clause in our constitution is clearly unconstitutional. Those who think that clause should be altered or dismissed should do it through the constitutional amendment process. Otherwise, it sets a precedent to deny or alter any part of the constitution for any reason that those in office at the time might deem worthy. It would make the constitution just a piece of paper. Reeder also states that one out of every 10 state workers in Illinois is paid more than $100,000 a year. Even if true, thats not so out of line with the private sector. The Huffington Post reports that 7.4 percent of Americans make $100,00 or more per year. A study by Washington University found that one of every five Americans will reach that goal at some point in their lives, and another study indicated that 9.5 percent of men currently earn that amount. Considering that the state hires a large percentage of highly trained and skilled workers, that 10 percent figure does not seem out of line. Dennis Gorecki, Orland Park, Hillary email scrutiny excessive, Regardless of the merits or outcome of the case against Hillary Clintons email arrangements while she was secretary of state, I wonder if any political figure in recent decades has undergone the same level of intensive, invasive, pervasive, downright tasteless and insulting scrutiny (can you say \"cankles\"?). Even President Barack Obama, with all the latent ugly fears and prejudices he has forced out of hiding, runs a distant second. I doubt that any white, male Republican presidential candidate could withstand this same level of microscopic inspection and come out smelling anything like a rose. And I think its safe to put your money on the fact that no such fire hose of scrutiny will ever be aimed at any one of them. Pat Langley, Chicago, The Daily Southtown welcomes letters to the editor.

{"Content": "[Astute television viewers know that cable networks have long crunched opening or closing credits on reruns to squeeze more time for ads into an hourlong slot. No harm, no foul, we say. But now comes disturbing word of cable mandarins tinkering with television classics. TBS and other cable channels use computer compression technology to subtly speed up some shows, The Wall Street Journal reports. And viewers have noticed. Author Stephen Cox, for instance, detected that the voices of the Munchkins in \"The Wizard of Oz\" were slightly raised, he told the Journal. \"It was astounding to me.\", And to us. TBS didnt stop at the exalted Oz. It has sped up classic \"Seinfeld\" reruns and other shows. Viacoms TV Land channel has accelerated \"Friends\" reruns, so it takes slightly less time for Ross and Rachel to get together and break up and get together and .... What to make of this?, In general, we applaud the acceleration of American life. We want our Starbucks latte to be delivered even faster. We wont wait more than a few minutes for a restaurant table. Our favorite words: Express lane. We firmly believe there should be a speed lane on sidewalks for brisk walkers. If election campaigns were whittled to weeks, not months or years, who would complain?, There are many TV programs we could rattle off  starting with the entire \"Bachelor\" or \"Bachelorette\" series and a passel of lame-but-somehow-popular comedies like \"Two Broke Girls,\" that would be improved if they were sped way up. An episode of \"The Big Bang Theory\" mercifully should take seven minutes, tops. We wouldnt raise a typing finger if \"Two and a Half Men\" clocked in at One and a Quarter Men. Or fewer. However, tampering with a classic movie on television, sneakily adding an octave to the Munchkins voices, is a maneuver that we cannot endorse. Because what starts on an egregiously padded series (\"American Idol\" reruns?) can easily be deployed to slice precious moments from, say, repeats of the sublime BBC series \"Sherlock,\" or the delightful \"The Mindy Project.\" And what starts as a few shaved seconds can easily snowball into bigger chunks of time, leading to stellar TV episodes that hurtle along at Keystone Kops speed. Theres another practical reason to crush this trend before it gains more momentum: We already have enough trouble following the convoluted plot twists and faster-talking explanations of \"Elementary\" or the British accents in \"Downton Abbey.\" If you accelerate those shows, theres even less time for the brain to absorb and savor every moment. We need a chance to catch our breath and mull the breakneck plot revelations in an intense episode of \"Elementary.\", No, cable mandarins, we will not accept the Alvin-and-the-Chipmunking of classic reruns. We demand to savor every last second of these shows, even if weve seen them a dozen times.

{"Content": "[Transit officials Wednesday laid out a grim scenario of service cuts on buses and trains, fare increases, layoffs and commuters returning to their cars in droves as early as summer if lawmakers approve Gov. Bruce Rauners plan to cut nearly $170 million from Chicago-area mass transit. The CTA, which provides 81 percent of the rides in the area, would suffer the largest funding hit under Rauners fiscal 2016 budget proposal, Regional Transportation Authority officials said. They were to present their findings to the RTA board Thursday. The CTA would face a 45 percent decrease in state funding, or a $130.1 million annual cut, according to the latest numbers crunched by the RTA, based on the governors proposed budget book and discussions with his staff. The projected cut, up from an earlier estimate of $105 million, equals 9 percent of the CTAs operating budget, officials said. To put that in perspective, $130.1 million pays for more than 10 weeks of bus service on the entire CTA system, CTA officials said. Looking at it another way, it represents more than 23 weeks of rail service, or a years worth of service on the Red, Orange and Brown lines, officials said. \"Gov. Rauners proposed cuts threaten the CTAs four years of impressive, hard-fought gains. Now is not the time to try and reverse those gains with shortsighted state cuts, said CTA spokeswoman Tammy Chase. She said it is too early to make public any contingency plans. The threat of a transit doomsday comes at a bad time for Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who faces a runoff election in less than three weeks. During Emanuels tenure, the CTA has wiped out a $308 million deficit and begun a $5 billion modernization plan. \"Right now, our main priority is to work with the governor and the legislature on the importance of preserving transit funding for the nearly 1.7 million rides the CTA provides each weekday,\" Chase said. Officials at Metra, which would lose 60 percent of state funding, or $20.8 million, said service reductions would be unavoidable under the Rauner cuts. Metra raised fares an average of almost 11 percent in February and already plans more increases over 10 years. The commuter railroad would have to increase fares by about another 6 percent to make up for the proposed state cut, officials said. Metra Chairman Martin Oberman said piling on more fare increases \"is just not a practical solution.\", But to maximize savings while doing the least amount of harm to the 11-line Metra system, some entire train crews would need to be eliminated, and that means trimming more than one or two runs on a specific line, Oberman said. \"(Rauners proposal) leaves everybody up in the air,\" Oberman said, \"but the idea would be to minimize the disruption and cut where it will affect the least number of people.\", Oberman said the big question is whether government subsidies will continue to play a large role in funding public transit or if riders will be required to pay the full cost of using the system. \"What this really boils down to is: Are you going to have mass transit, and who is going to pay for it? he said. Contacted Wednesday about the RTAs projections, officials from Rauners office gave no indication he would budge on his proposal that would cut state funding to the CTA, Metra and Pace. \"The governor looks forward to working with the RTA to help them implement many of the reforms he has already proposed that will help reduce costs and provide greater value for taxpayers,\" said Rauner spokeswoman Catherine Kelly. Rauner faces an uphill struggle to win approval from the Democrat-controlled General Assembly concerning his deficit-reduction plan to cut funding to the transit systems and a host of other agencies statewide. House Speaker Michael Madigan, D-Chicago, has indicated its likely to take a combination of cuts and new revenue to get a final budget passed. RTA Executive Director Leanne Redden said that if service cuts become necessary, they could go into effect sometime after July 1. The transit agencies operate on a calendar-year budget, while the states budget is on a fiscal year, which starts in July. \"These cuts could ultimately result in hundreds of thousands of drivers returning to our already heavily trafficked road and highway system and impact vital connections to jobs and education throughout the region,\" Redden said. RTA Chairman Kirk Dillard said other states have increased mass transit investment. \"Illinois should not be cutting mass transit, as it is a major economic development generator for our region and the state, he said. Pace would see a 41 percent decrease in state funding, amounting to a roughly $10 million cut to its suburban bus system, according to the RTA analysis. Pace Executive Director T.J. Ross said $10 million may not seem like a lot of money, but it would come out of the agencys $223 million operating budget and hurt most Pace customers who do not have alternate means of transportation. \"When we reduce service, it hurts people and they cannot get to jobs, Ross said. He said $10 million represents 60 percent of Paces administrative costs, or the expense of operate two of the suburban bus agencys nine garages. Meanwhile, paratransit services, which are provided through Pace under the Americans with Disabilities Act, would lose about 15 percent of the state funds, or $8.5 million, according to the RTA. Customers pay $3 per ride, while the cost to provide the federally mandated ADA service is roughly $40 per ride, officials said. The services projected annual cost is $172 million, while revenue from fares totals about $14 million, Pace spokesman Patrick Wilmot said. Ross said if the loss in state funding were placed on the backs of paratransit customers, the paratransit fare could easily rise to $5. \"That would be very hard on people, said Ross, who urged all transit riders to contact their elected officials to voice opposition to the governors proposed funding cuts. Federal law prohibits transit agencies from discriminating against people with disabilities because transportation is a civil right. But Dillard said the state law covering free rides for some senior citizens, based on income levels, should be reviewed in the wake of the proposed elimination of $34 million in state reimbursements. The actual cost of providing state-mandated free rides and federally mandated reduced-fare rides totals $130 million, according to the RTA. \"It is grossly unfair to remove the last penny of subsidies to fulfill expensive state mandates when the subsidies we get today only cover a fraction of the cost of those mandates to begin with,\" Dillard said. \"If the state is going to ask us to provide these services through state law, then they should provide the funding or they should lift the mandates under law.\", jhilkevitch@tribpub.com, Twitter @jhilkevitch]", "Date": "20150319", "Title": "[Transit riders are warned to brace for possible service cuts, fare hikes]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com//news/local/breaking/ct-rta-funding-cuts-met-0319-20150319-story.html\n", "Author": "[Jon Hilkevitch]"}

{"Content": "[A week before the February city election, Mayor Rahm Emanuel stood alongside Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson and his billionaire business partner to announce their $10 million donation for a summer jobs program in the citys toughest neighborhoods. The event with the NBA Hall of Famer was orchestrated by the mayors office and aimed to smooth a rough spot in his first-term resume  the notion that he had not done enough to reduce crime and increase opportunity in predominantly African-American neighborhoods. But thats not all Johnson and his partner did to help Emanuel. Four days after the news conference, the week-old company Johnson formed with partner Mark Walter to fund the jobs program donated $100,000 to Emanuels campaign. Last week, with Emanuel still locked in a tough runoff battle for a second term, the company gave Emanuel $150,000. And at the same time, the Emanuel administration has been good for Johnson. Last year, the Emanuel-appointed Chicago Board of Education awarded one of Johnsons companies  SodexoMAGIC  an $80 million contract to provide custodial and facilities management for Chicago Public Schools facilities. Four years ago, Emanuel came into office promising to end the \"insiders game\" that benefits only the well-connected. But the \"Magic\" Johnson relationship is just the latest example of a hallmark of Emanuels governing style  his deep reliance on political cash from business interests who can count on City Hall or the mayor himself to help them. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel fell short of enough votes to win the Feb. 24 primary, forcing a runoff April 7 with Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia. In January, the Tribune detailed how Emanuel raised more than $14 million through 2014 from an elite group of 103 contributors, 60 of which received some benefit from him or his administration. The circle of donors, made up of investment firms, developers, law firms and restaurateurs, received contracts, permits, appointments or personal mayoral endorsements. Now, as Emanuel tries to fend off challenger Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia, many of those same donors are renewing their support in an unprecedented fundraising blitz for a Chicago mayors race that is pushing Emanuels two political funds to nearly $20 million for this election. In addition, a super political action fund supporting the mayor has raised another $3.6 million, much of it from his most loyal donors. For instance:, Emanuel accepted $50,000 in contributions last month from two executives at Related Companies, whose Chicago branch Related Midwest has put up major buildings along the lakefront and the Chicago River and took over the deed to the site of the failed Chicago Spire. The donations are on top of the $77,100 in contributions Related executives have given Emanuel since he took office. The Emanuel-controlled Plan Commission signed off on the companys next major project, a 67-story tower at 451 E. Grand Ave. in December and the City Council signed off on Jan. 21. A little more than two weeks later, the Emanuel campaign logged the two $25,000 contributions. Emanuel on Jan. 20 visited the office of Context Media for an event listed as \"non-city\" on his official calendar, a term that often signals a fundraiser or other campaign-related appearance. Donations from two Context Media executives were recorded that week, totaling $10,000. Less than a week after the visit, Emanuel was back at the business for a promotional jobs announcement where he called the company a key player in the citys tech scene and a place where \"ideas are formed.\", The mayor collected $25,000 from more than a dozen people connected to the law firm of Greenberg Traurig, which represented Chicagos interests in the bankruptcy of American Airlines and was the law firm for JCDecaux in that companys successful bid for an advertising lease at Chicagos two airports. His official calendar shows he visited the firm for a lunch Jan. 27. The Tribunes January story highlighted donations tied to a new hotel development in River North that features three players who have given to the mayor: Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises, White Lodging and Friedman Properties. The complex on North Clark Street features three hotel flags in one complex, and one of Lettuce Entertain Yous newest concepts. Since the start of the year, Lettuce Entertain You, led by Richard Melman, has given the mayor another $156,000, records show. Bruce White of White Lodging has donated another $50,000 and people associated with Friedman Properties, led by Robert Friedman, have donated another $31,000. Emanuel has declined requests to discuss his fundraising practices but in a brief exchange earlier this month he said businesses give to him because they support his leadership. \"We follow the law specifically,\" Emanuel said when asked why it was appropriate to take campaign contributions from donors who need City Hall approval. \"And we follow everything to the letter.\", Last months news conference wasnt the first time Emanuel stood alongside Johnson and Walter, the head of Guggenheim Partners investment firm, for a city event. In early 2014 the mayor announced the news that EquiTrust Life Insurance, jointly owned by Johnson and Guggenheim, was opening new offices in Chicago. Two months later, at the same time Emanuel officials were touting Johnsons plan for the school system, Guggenheim officials and their spouses donated a combined $101,100 to Emanuel political funds. The most recent donations come from a newly formed company that the mayor and the businessmen said would send the $10 million donation to social service groups who can provide summer jobs to Chicago youngsters. On Feb. 13, Inner City Youth Empowerment LLC was created in Delaware, according to the Delaware secretary of states office. Four days after its creation, on Feb. 17, Emanuel announced Inner City Youth Empowerments $10 million donation. And three days after that, on Feb. 20, the same company made the $100,000 campaign contribution to Chicago for Rahm Emanuel, the mayors main political fund, according to state campaign finance records, followed by the $150,000 donation March 13. The news conference came as Emanuel courted support from African-American voters, a key constituency in the runoff election. Emanuels soft support from black voters contributed to his failure to win the multi-candidate February election outright, leading to the runoff with Garcia. During the Feb. 17 event, Johnson lauded Emanuels performance on issues affecting the black community and detailed how Walter made the event happen. \"He called me up and said, Earvin, were going to support the mayor. Youve got to come because this is what youre about, \" said Johnson, who noted he also provides alternative school programs for CPS. During the news conference, a reporter asked whether Johnsons presence was a political endorsement of Emanuel. \"The mayor shouldnt need it,\" Johnson quickly replied. \"He has it but he shouldnt need it because hes doing a wonderful job.\", Emanuel then stepped to the microphone. \"There will be a time for politics. But this is about the kids of the city of Chicago, and dont take it away from them,\" Emanuel said. \"And I do appreciate the endorsement. \"And I do want to stand on your shoulders at some point,\" the mayor said to Johnson, drawing laughs from the audience. The contributions do not name Johnson or Walter. They were given in the name of Inner City Youth Empowerment, the company formed by Johnson, Walter, and the Chicago businessmans wife, Kimbra Walter. \"Inner City Youth Empowerment made a contribution to the mayors campaign because Mr. Johnson and Ms. and Mr. Walter believe that the mayors efforts to help urban youth and his efforts to gain financial and other support for youth programs is very important to continue the gains that have been made,\" Walter spokesman Michael Sitrick said in an email. Johnson did not respond to calls seeking comment. The jobs grant will be used to expand the One Summer Chicago Plus program, said Evelyn Diaz, commissioner of the citys Department of Family Support Services. Once the Emanuel administration picks community organizations to hire and train the youths, they will receive the money directly from Inner City Youth Empowerment, Diaz said. The contributions from Johnson and Walter came as CPS has branched out its efforts to privatize and centralize the food service, custodial and engineering functions of schools and awarded SodexoMAGIC the plum contract. In March 2014, the same month as the earlier donations from Guggenheim officials, CPS Chief Administrator Tim Cawley made a lengthy presentation to the school board touting the benefits of the contracts with SodexoMAGIC and another key contractor, Aramark. \"SodexoMAGIC has a dual role for us. Were bringing them in to provide overall facilities guidance for us from a central standpoint. How do we schedule our engineers? How do we prioritize the maintenance projects they work on today to avoid capital investments a year or two from now because we didnt do what needed to be done in the building? How do we plan better?\" Cawley said. He said the privatization contracts would ultimately result in $40 million in savings, as well as streamlining custodial and engineering functions to let principals focus more on educational matters. \"SodexoMAGIC has a second role too, in that while were making this change were going to pilot in 33 schools where theyre going to take over the whole kit and caboodle,\" Cawley said. \"These are schools that are already entirely privatized with outsourced engineers and custodians, and were going to do a trial there where Sodexo manages everything in the building.\", But just six months later, Cawley and board members were on their heels over the poor performance of both contractors. In September, the Tribune reported that complaints about dirty school buildings piled up after CPS hired the contractors. Questions about cleanliness of the schools intensified after Aramark laid off nearly 480 custodians. \"We dont think weve been successful in getting enough schools cleaner, nor have we been successful in simplifying life for principals,\" Cawley said at the time. Johnson has other business interests with CPS. EdisonLearning, a for-profit school contractor, operates the Magic Johnson Bridgescape Academy, an alternative school program that operates at several locations around the city. Johnson and Walter are business partners in several enterprises, most notably the Los Angeles Dodgers. Johnson is a partner in the company that owns the Dodgers, called Guggenheim Baseball Management. Walter is the controlling partner of Guggenheim Baseball. Walter has met at least three times with Emanuel in his office, according to the mayors public calendar, including a one-on-one meeting in 2012. Emanuel met twice in October 2014 with Walter and prominent Chicago attorney Dan Webb, whose firm has handled Guggenheim business. According to the calendars, the meetings included top mayoral aide David Spielfogel.

{"Content": "[For so many years, people did exactly what James T. Butts Jr. told them to do. It works like that when you are a police chief and your officers must follow every command. But after Butts got elected mayor of Inglewood in 2011, he ran smack into a couple of City Council members who kept opposing him. \"The meetings were clown shows,\" he recalls. \"When youre used to order and discipline ... it was tough to take.\", So the mayor dipped into his campaign funds, lent tens of thousands to help a businessman and a former police buddy defeat the incumbents, and created a council in which, he says, \"everyone is dialed in that there is one quarterback.\", For better or worse, this approach has brought change to a city scrambling back from the verge of bankruptcy. The Forum has been revived and there are plans for commercial and residential development at the site of the old Hollywood Park racetrack. With Butts now focused on luring the NFL to Inglewood, his forceful style might give him an edge. Just weeks after St. Louis Rams owner Stan Kroenke and his partners announced plans to build a $1.86-billion stadium next to the Forum, Butts and his council hurriedly approved the project in February. \"Now we can celebrate,\" he said. Not everyone in the room was thrilled. Some residents, calling for a public vote, felt railroaded by a 61-year-old mayor they describe as \"intimidating\" and \"dictatorial.\", \"He talks to us like children,\" says Lynette Lewis, a regular presence at council meetings. \"Its like, Im your daddy and Im going to run things like I want. \", A bear of a man with a steely constitution and an occasional temper, Butts insists no politician can please everyone. \"When youre driven, the upside is you get things done,\" says Earl Ofari Hutchinson, a prominent Los Angeles activist whose dealings with Butts date back four decades. \"The downside is, you can be seen in different ways. I would not use the term bully, but Ive certainly heard that word from some people in the community.\", ::, Butts grew up in an apartment near USC. His mother worked nights as a nurse at California Hospital, so he and his brother had to go to the library with their father, who was studying to become an electrical engineer. \"There was nothing to do but read,\" he recalls. \"Youre looking at a child who read books four hours a night, five nights a week.\", After graduating from Crenshaw High in 1971, Butts enrolled at Cal State Los Angeles, where he studied business in hopes of becoming a corporate attorney. A new car derailed those plans. Needing money to soup up his Volkswagen Beetle, Butts responded to a want ad. The Inglewood Police Department was paying part-time cadets as much as $4.19 an hour  \"all the money in the world in those days,\" he says. The job might have seemed like an odd fit for a 19-year-old who had grown up in a community that distrusted the police. He recalls an unpleasant incident when he and his brother were hassled at an Inglewood public pool: \"The Inglewood police actually told us we shouldnt come there.\", The cadets position morphed into a full-time spot in late 1974, and Butts eventually started a family that would grow to include two daughters and a son. While working, he made time to finish college and earn an MBA from Cal Poly Pomona. Police work suited him. Tense situations, such as domestic disputes and bank robberies, tested his analytical nature, giving him only seconds to come up with a plan of action. \"Ninety percent of what you do in law enforcement is conflict resolution,\" he says. \"I loved the challenge.\", ::, Through the 1980s, Butts was building a reputation in Southern California law enforcement as a man willing to make changes. His rise in the Inglewood department was swift, from patrol officer to SWAT commander to deputy chief, each new assignment accompanied by mandates such as improving community relations or cracking down on drug sales. In 1991, Santa Monica made him the citys first black chief of police. His first task: To reduce the number of officer-involved shootings. Butts limited the situations as to when police officers could fire their weapons, which alienated much of the rank-and-file. In another controversial move, he enforced restrictions on the homeless living in public parks. The city attorney fought him, calling the law \"oppressive,\" but was ultimately fired. A business education had made Butts a different sort of cop, his approach informed by elements of corporate strategy. It sometimes bewildered him when critics failed to see the logic in his methodology. \"For me,\" he says, \"the whole thing is results.\", Los Angeles International Airport officials were impressed enough to hire him as head of security in 2006. They wanted more discipline and Butts quickly set the tone by firing an officer  John Youngblood  for a minor rule violation. Youngblood had returned a stolen video game to its owner without submitting paperwork. But something unusual happened at the dismissal hearing in which he won back his job. The new boss liked how he defended himself, and subsequently put him in charge of a project to revamp patrols. The two men grew to respect each other. \"People who feel that James is a bully misunderstand him,\" Youngblood says. \"When he has a vision, he wants to get it done. Thats how hes been so successful.\", ::, In early 2010, the mayor of cash-strapped Inglewood stepped down and pleaded guilty to a conflict of interest charge. The thought of running for office had never appealed to Butts, who recalls thinking that \"in the aggregate, elected officials were pinheads.\" Still, the career police officer left his airport job to run for interim mayor, convinced he could save the city that had given him his start. Some people were happy to see him campaigning on the streets. Others carped about the citys problems or expressed doubt about electing a cop. Butts found that asking for votes was a humbling experience. \"A police department is a paramilitary organization and the chief is the closest thing to God on Earth that there is,\" he says. \"This was the toughest thing Id ever done.\", It grew tougher when voters chose someone else to finish out the mayors term. Still, Butts kept stumping and won the next election, six months later, in a runoff. Taking office in 2011, he renegotiated long-term employee benefits and announced layoffs and furloughs. The city also raised its water rates. The Forum renovation came about in 2012 as Madison Square Garden Co. sought to expand to the West Coast. MSG executives praised Butts for cutting through red tape to facilitate the $23.5-million purchase. \"Without the mayor, this deal simply would not have happened,\" Hank Ratner, former president and chief executive, said at the time. The aging arena, once home to the Lakers and Kings, was modernized as a concert hall. Butts called it \"validation of our city as a place to do big business.\", In short order, the dormant proposal to redevelop Hollywood Park was revived. Next came plans to renovate Market Street and transform the shuttered Daniel Freeman Hospital into townhomes. The city was making headlines for something other than gang violence. ::, The race to bring pro football back to the Southland has come down to Inglewood versus Carson, the proposal from the Rams owner competing with a plan by the Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers to share a stadium. Eager to woo the NFL, Butts has appeared frequently on television news and talk radio to tout his city as a business-friendly environment with a leader who runs a tight ship. Not that he has swayed opponents. Union officials once circulated a flier at Christmas depicting him as Scrooge. Residents and reporters have clashed with him at meetings. \"He can be very charming to people, theres no doubt about it,\" says Randall Fleming, former editor of a local newspaper. \"But hes still very much a cop who sees himself in complete control. He cannot stand anybody talking back or opposing his policies.\", Butts recently backed out of a radio appearance when he learned adversaries would be on the show. Hutchinson worries he \"has not respected public input enough.\", At a recent City Council meeting, the mayor displayed an air of command as he entered the chambers in a black suit, taking his seat at the center of the dais. He listened quietly as people complained about unemployment and card club regulations. Things arent perfect, Butts acknowledges, but he sees a bright future for Inglewood, if only people will follow his lead. Surveying the room, he told the crowd: \"This is a good time for us.\", david.wharton@latimes.com, Twitter:@LATimesWharton]", "Date": "20150319", "Title": "[Inglewood's forceful mayor wants people to follow his NFL lead]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com//sports/la-sp-c1-nfl-stadium-butts-20150319-story.html\n", "Author": "[David Wharton]"}
{"Content": "[Like a suitcase on the worlds longest luggage carousel, Hillary Rodham Clintons all-but-assured presidential candidacy is now drifting back toward us, begging to be claimed whether or not we still want  or even remember  what is packed inside. Oh, right. Dirty laundry. Some of it dating back decades. And much of it so stained it damages everything it touches. Though Bill Clinton may represent the gold standard in political scandals, Hillary Clinton was getting into trouble as early as her husbands first presidential run in 1992. That was the year she found herself in hot water with country music fans by responding to a question about her husbands alleged infidelity by saying \"Im not sitting here as some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette.\", Clinton later apologized to Wynette, just as she had to atone for another campaign trail quip  \"I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was fulfill my profession\"  by entering a cookie recipe in a Family Circle magazine sponsored bake-off. Youd think shed have learned her lesson, but once the Clintons got to the White House, she managed to knock out tempests in various-sized teapots as readily as Wynette knocked out singles in the late 1960s. If you were a sentient being during the Clinton presidency, surely you remember some of the greatest hits from the repertoire of scandals, many of which were perceived as bugaboos of a Hillary-specific nature. There was Whitewater and Travelgate and all that business about her talking to Eleanor Roosevelt through psychics. There was Clintons insistence that the Monica Lewinsky story and Kenneth Starr investigation were products of a \"vast right-wing conspiracy.\", Then theres \"Hillary Clintons Greatest Scandals, Volume Two,\" which starts, arguably, with her magic carpet ride to New York, where she set up camp in order to run for Senate, and ends with the modern classic of Clintonian scandals, Benghazi. But of course thats not the end. Now that its come out that Clinton used a private server for official work emails during her time at the State Department, we have (yes, its really being called this) \"email-ghazi.\" Even as Clinton explained herself at a news conference, insisting that all relevant messages were saved and turned over to the State Department when she left her post as secretary, Republicans were crying foul. I dont know about you, but given that Clinton is a 67-year-old grandmother, Im just impressed that shes not still using AOL. Over the years, Clinton has been likened to any number of cultural (and often female) archetypes: the schoolmarm, the shrew, the doormat, the ambition-soaked megalomaniac. But as the prospect of another presidential bid inches ever closer on that luggage carousel, its increasingly clear that the role she returns to most often is that of a partner in an abusive relationship. In her case, a relationship with the public. No matter how hard Clinton gets knocked down in the press and in the polls, she stays with us. No matter how badly her would-be supporters treated her in the past by switching their allegiances to Barack Obama (or, today, by flirting with Elizabeth Warren), she still wants our approval  particularly the ne plus ultra of our approval, which would be election to highest office in the land. Of course, true to form, Clinton is an equal partner in this abusive dynamic. To many of her longtime supporters, her hawkishness and unapologetic embrace of Washington business-as-usual has felt at times like a right cross to the left cheek. That so many have nonetheless hung in with her  her unspoken campaign slogan sometimes seems akin to \"Hillary: Weve Waited This Long, So Why Give Up Now?\"  suggests that Clinton takes a perverse pleasure in all the abuse. Otherwise, why wouldnt she have just used common sense along with email at State?, Maybe because she already knows something that most commanders in chief dont find out until they reach office. She knows that the relationship between the president of the United States and the citizens of the United States is largely an abusive one, or at least a tortured one. Full of empty promises on one side and constant dissatisfaction on the other, youd have to be a glutton for punishment to venture intoitat all. Which is why Clinton, that ever-hopeful suitcase, may be perfect for the job. No matter how roughly shes handled, shes still waiting patiently for us to claim her. mdaum@latimescolumnists.com, Twitter: @meghan_daum, Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion and Facebook]", "Date": "20150318", "Title": "[Hillary Clinton and us - a portrait of an abusive relationship]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com//news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-daum-hillary-clinton-relationship-voters-abusive-20150319-column.html\n", "Author": "[Meghan Daum]"}
{"Content": "[Calls to get parents more involved, recruit more African-American and Latino staff and look closer at student discipline and school safety were among the wish list items for several candidates of the East Aurora School Board that popped up repeatedly Tuesday at a forum sponsored by the DuPage County branch of the NAACP. The nine candidates mostly agreed that the district needs to invest heavily in preschool and kindergarten, set high expectations for students regardless of their backgrounds, offer students a multitude of options from more Advanced Placement courses to vocational training and work to make sure that teacher lessons are strong and aligned from elementary to high school. Candidates acknowledged that the district had its challenges  including a high rate of students who move around, skip class and drop out  but repeatedly cited East Auroras students and demographics as strengths. More than nine in 10 students are black or Hispanic in the district. The candidates, all of whom live in Aurora, are running for four open seats on the school board on the April 7 ballot. The terms last four years. Two candidates are sitting board members, including the current president, Raymond Hull. Hull is the superintendent of water and sewer maintenance for the City of Aurora. Hes served a total of nine years on the board and has three children, two of whom are grown and one who is a 2013 East Aurora High School graduate. He said he was proud of bringing \"decorum\" to the school board and making sure all board members are allowed to speak and share their thoughts. His primary goal, he said, is to serve on a board where members make informed decisions without making assumptions. \"Changing culture starts at the top  I think thats why were all here,\" he said. \"Each one of us believes we can impact how things will go over the next four years.\", Mary Louise \"Lou\" Peryea, whos served on the board the last two years, also is running for re-election. She has two grown children and works as a special education teachers assistant at Hope D. Wall School in Aurora. Her main goal, she said, is to make sure all the board members embrace their role. Since 2013, Peryea said, the board has gotten out of the day-to-day management of the district. The board works more on planning now and lets educators do the teaching  which wasnt the case in the past, she said. Candidate Kimberly Hatchett is a vice president at the Chicago-based Health Care Service Corporation, which operates five state Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans. In her role, she oversees claims processing and call centers set up to work with the Affordable Care Act. She has two children who graduated from Indian Prairie School District 204. Her No. 1 goal is to improve the districts process for contracting and managing vendors  by saving money there, she said, the district can invest more in educating students. Anita Lewis is a former school board member whose four-year term ended in 2013. She has two children who graduated from East Aurora and she works in supply chain management at the Aurora-based Henry Pratt Company. Her main goal, she said, is to listen to what staff and students need so she can help improve trust and dialogue within the district. Mary Garza is a professional engineer for the City of Auroras Department of Public Works. She has children in preschool, third grade and fourth grade in East Aurora. Her biggest goal would be to establish a strong board that can work together with open minds  and \"bring professionalism back into board room,\" she said. Kenneth Darby is a master tradesman for the Forest Preserve District of Kane County. He has three children, two of whom are a senior and sophomore at East High. Darby also is the president of the East Aurora Band Boosters. His main goal, he said, is to see a \"role model effect\" taking place in the district. Julie Garofalo, a mother of five, is an independent education consultant who spent a decade at Marmion Academy where she served in a variety of administrative roles, including overseeing college guidance, student and academic services and student life. Her biggest goal, she said, is to make sure the district has a thought-out communication plan so East Aurora can let the community know about the work thats being done. Alex Arroyo is a long-time flight attendant for United Airlines. His No. 1 goal, he said, is to make sure the board collaborates and to get counselors doing home visits to help teachers understand what students home lives are like. He said he believed the board needed a \"clean slate\" in April. John Laesch is a carpenter in the Ottawa-based Local Union 195. His main goal, he said, is to improve teamwork and community involvement and to hold more forums that address district issues. Staff diversity, The need to diversify the administrative and teaching staff was repeatedly mentioned by candidates. Last year, about one in five East Aurora teachers was black or Hispanic, according to state data. Hatchett said the district needs to reflect the demographics of the Aurora community. Its important, she said, for students to see teachers who look like them who can serve as role models. Garofalo said it was important to create conditions where teachers can improve their practice  which includes training to help them work with students of color. Arroyo pointed out that many bilingual staffers have been recruited in the past from Spain or Puerto Rico. He and Darby advocated an incentive program to encourage district graduates to come back and teach in East Aurora or to bring new teachers into the area. Lewis said it was important to hire the best staff possible, which includes hiring staff who match the student demographic. She said she would have liked to see the board last year hire a superintendent with experience doing turnarounds, instead of Superintendent Michael Popp, who came from the nearby, more affluent District 204. Peryea defended the boards hire. \"Dr. Popp comes from a high-achieving district,\" she said. \"Its hard to believe he could have spent his career there and not absorbed information to bring over to our district.\", Hull  who has for years advocated at board meetings the need for more teachers of color  said he supported lobbying the state to change how teachers are tested and deemed proficient. A few years ago, the cut scores that teacher candidates needed to pass the basic skills test were raised and the state put in place a policy that prevented candidates from taking each of the tests four parts more than five times. The changes disproportionally affected teacher candidates of color. Last year, the state got rid of the limit in hopes of raising the diversity of the teaching pool. Recruiting teachers from out of state also has become harder, Hull added, which contributes to the districts difficulty in finding more teachers of color. Discipline and safety, The topics of school safety and student discipline  which have been discussed lately at school board meetings since a 20-year-old Aurora man allegedly carried a loaded handgun into East High in late January  were also debated. \"Our schools are safe,\" Hull said. \"There are some challenges, but they are safe.\", Lewis said she had concerns that the schools were not safe right now. She advocated hiring more staff to monitor the high school halls, a request one teacher made at Mondays school board meeting. Darby said he believed the district needed to take a harder stance on students who arent cooperating and dont want to be in school  whether thats a referral or an expulsion. \"Its not our duty to babysit them if they dont want to be there,\" he said. \"We need the kids who want to be there to have the environment that encourages them to learn and that cant happen if theres disruptions in class.\", Darby said the district needs to follow the recommendations of police, if officers are involved in an incident. Arroyo said he, too, believed that badly behaved students should be expelled. But he said he didnt want a police presence in the schools. \"We dont want to create the situation where minority students get a criminal record because of police in schools,\" he said. Laesch said he supported hiring more staff to monitor the high school halls and creating a more uniform discipline policy at the middle schools so when students get to the high school they have been exposed to the same rules. Garofalo said she believed discipline begins with respect for students. She advocated for more classroom management training and fair, consistently enforced discipline policies. \"There is no bad child,\" she said. Hatchett said the alternative education program should be used for students with behavior issues and staff need to \"get to the heart of what (the students) issue is\" before learning can begin. Hull said he didnt believe zero tolerance policies were effective and that students should be given opportunities to change. Peryea said teachers do work on classroom management skills as part of their professional learning communities, where they meet with other teachers to work on their practice. She agreed that zero tolerance wasnt the answer. \"Dr. Popp has strong feelings that we can only educate children if they are in our buildings,\" she said. \"We will do everything we can to keep our students safe.\", A second candidates forum will be held March 31 at 6 p.m. in the East High auditorium.

{"Content": "[As congressional Republicans find themselves tangled over their newly introduced spending plans, President Obama tried Wednesday to seize the moment to talk about government spending on his terms, namely a focus on opportunities for the middle class. Noting that Republican House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio often asks, \"Where are the jobs?,\" Obama told a crowd in Cleveland he was there to \"not only answer that question\" but also to renew a central debate over the two major parties economic visions. Obama said that his administrations policies, such as investing in manufacturing and the landmark Affordable Care Act, have helped the nation emerge from a deep recession but that the Republican budget would \"double down\" on the theory that wealth trickles down from the rich to the rest. \"Reality has rendered its judgment,\" Obama said in a speech to the City Club of Cleveland. \"Trickle-down economics doesnt work and middle-class economics does,\" he said, using the White Houses umbrella term for its fiscal policies. Meanwhile, Republicans who have the majority in both chambers of Congress are bogged down in trying to make their budgets workable as well as palatable to the partys competing factions. More than two months into the new Congress, they are grasping for legislative victories and looking to the House and Senate budgets unveiled this week as chances for a win in Washington. The chambers are expected to approve the budgets next week. \"Hopefully that will be an opportunity for us to show some success,\" said GOP Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee. Republicans are trying to present a unified front in their budget proposals, as internal debates have spilled out publicly between defense hawks, who want to bolster military coffers, and deficit-minded conservatives, who prefer to hold the line on new spending. Although both of the partys budgets largely boost military spending at the expense of domestic social programs, House and Senate Republicans are at odds over how to accomplish that goal while still adhering to strict budget caps agreed to in a 2011 deal with the White House. Senate Republicans made clear Wednesday that they view the House approach as essentially a gimmick. It calls for hiking defense spending by increasing money for an account used for wars that was not subject to the so-called sequester limits established in the 2011 deal. Senate Republicans prefer establishing a separate, new defense account funded with unspecified savings elsewhere, but it also would not be held to the 2011 caps. Either way, those cause \"real heartburn for conservatives\" because they maneuver around the limits, Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.) said. Those differences and others  including the Houses proposed Medicare overhaul that the Senate rejects  risk leaving the GOP unable to pass one budget. Such a setback would derail not only the goal of increasing Pentagon spending, but also other priorities, including the effort to repeal Obamas healthcare law. \"Im absolutely confident well do our duty,\" said Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, head of the Republican Senates campaign committee. \"Its one of the most important votes well have this year.\", The GOPs scramble to make the numbers add up with concrete legislative proposals while Obama spoke in broad, aspirational terms further illustrated the contrast between the White House and Republicans who control Congress. Obama no longer has to worry about being reelected, and since the November midterm election has made full use of the presidential bully pulpit to present his vision for the country without necessarily fretting over the short-term political consequences for him or his party. On Wednesday, he said he wanted to \"take a little credit\" for the nations economic recovery. Republicans have been loath to acknowledge any role Obamas policies might have had in the nations improved economic picture, with deficits on the wane and rising confidence among voters. \"Republicans are proud to take credit for helping force some fiscal responsibility on the Obama administration,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Wednesday as his partys Senate majority released its budget for the fiscal year that begins in October. The White House countered that the House GOP is trying to balance the budget in part by further slashing investments that would benefit the middle class. \"House Republicans start their deficit reduction plan by promising large, expensive new tax cuts to high-income households,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. \"In fact, the only specific tax proposals in the House Republican budget are tax proposals that benefit the wealthy.\", White House officials are eager to promote the notion that Obama has kept Republicans on their heels with a vigorous start to what he calls the \"fourth quarter\" of his term, a time when presidents often see their influence wane. Obama began the year with campaign-style trips in the run-up to a State of the Union address that challenged Congress new Republican majorities on a host of domestic issues. Democrats who shied away from the president before the midterm election now praise Obamas approach. Some, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is the Democrats ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee, have more leeway to push the party toward even more liberal policies. \"The president feels liberated,\" said Sen. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the assistant Democratic leader in the chamber. \"He doesnt have to measure his actions against the impact on a campaign, and there are many things that he wants to say to the American people in the last two years of his presidency.\", michael.memoli@latimes.com, lisa.mascaro@latimes.com, Memoli reported from Cleveland and Mascaro from Washington.

{"Content": "[By definitively re-electing Benjamin Netanyahu, Israelis refused to go left and refused to go right. This was what Netanyahu expected when he called for early elections  and having just won his fourth, he certainly counts as the expert. The important question now is why Israelis are sticking with the status quo when external critics from the left and internal critics from the right were hoping for a meaningful course correction. Start with the biggest headline, namely the failure of the center-left coalition led by Isaac Herzog and former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni to eclipse support for Netanyahus center-right party and its far-right partners. To critics abroad, from U.S. Democrats who share President Barack Obamas evident dislike of Netanyahu to Europeans of all political stripes who consider Netanyahu closed to peace, it was exciting to think that the center-left might stage a historic recovery and bring us back to the days of Ehud Barak or even Yitzhak Rabin. But there are at least two major reasons the center-left failed to re-emerge. The most important is that Israeli-Palestinian relations, the only area in which the Herzog-Livni coalition would have differed meaningfully from Netanyahu, dont depend only on Israel. They depend on the Palestinians, too. Right now, the Palestinian side doesnt have a credible partner with which Israel could make a lasting peace. Mahmoud Abbas might conceivably be willing to do a deal, but it appears he cant deliver a unified Palestinian public behind him. Hamas, which controls Gaza, hasnt truly reconciled with him. Equally important, Abbas, who turns 80 next week, has limited staying power  and its unclear who will follow him. Historically, Israelis have been prepared to choose center-left governments and negotiate peace when the possibility seemed realistic. Otherwise, they tend to prefer the center-right. More than any other factor, this historical reality explains the defeat of the center-left. An adjunct factor to the center-lefts weakness is that it isnt led by a figure with strong national security credentials. Barak and Rabin were former generals, who could compromise and make peace without being perceived as weak. Herzog, an Israeli aristocrat, is the son of a president and the grandson of a chief rabbi. But hes a career lawyer and politician, as is Livni. It would be great if the center-left didnt have to field another general to gain national security legitimacy. But realistically, a nervous, distrustful public in a society that respects the military probably still needs something more before placing the fate of the country in the hands of a potential peacemaker. Turn now to the other important result of the election: Netanyahu substantially strengthened himself relative to the far-right components of his coalition, Naftali Bennetts Jewish Home and Avigdor Liebermans Israel Is Our Home. In all probability, this was the gain Netanyahu most wanted. The excuse for the breakdown of the government was an intra-Cabinet controversy over a proposed new basic law  Israels version of a constitutional amendment  that would have altered Israels traditional definition of itself as Jewish and democratic by strengthening the former and weakening the latter. Netanyahu didnt want to embrace the most extreme form of the rights redefinition of the national project. The Israeli public has now given Netanyahu a mandate to keep the far-right to his right, and to maintain the basic ideological posture of the state in its current form. That means wild talk of annexing most of the West Bank will be quieted, at least for the immediately perceivable political future. To Netanyahus critics within Israel and outside, this may seem like a matter of rhetoric rather than a matter of political reality. After all, Netanyahu has made it clear that he has no intention to stop settlements, and no present intention to make peace  which means that, in effect, Israel is moving in the direction of a permanent presence in the area between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean. Without discounting the long-term effects of increased settlements, especially in the absence of a peace process worthy of the name, theres still an important difference between Netanyahus position and that of Bennett and Lieberman. In essence, the Israeli far-right is prepared to abandon the aspiration for Israel to be a liberal democratic state in the Western European mold. Faced with criticisms that Israel falls short of its liberal democratic ideals, Netanyahus instinct is to explain that Israel is trying to achieve equality, democracy and rights under the constraints of its rough Middle Eastern neighborhood and the Palestinian aspiration to full nationhood. To critics, the answer is disingenuous. But Netanyahu believes it, and so anchors Israeli politics in the space of contradictory imperfection. Bennett and Liebermans instinct is simply to accept and acknowledge that Israel isnt going to be liberal or democratic when it comes to Palestinians, now or ever. If the far-right were to overtake the center-right in Israeli politics, as has sometimes seemed possible in recent years, Israel might no longer collectively aspire to reconcile its Jewish national character with liberal democracy. It might simply embrace particularism at the expense of universal values. That way lies not just second-class status for Palestinians, but population transfer. The consequences of such a turn would be truly disastrous, for Israelis and Palestinians alike.

{"Content": "[Palestinians signaled on Wednesday that if a right-wing new government takes command in Israel, they will enlist the help of the international community in pursuing their statehood bid and pressing war-crimes action against Israel. With nearly all the ballots counted by Wednesday morning, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus conservative Likud party outpolled the center-left Zionist Union by a substantial margin, positioning Netanyahu to assemble a governing coalition. Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator in earlier peace talks with Israel, said it appeared Netanyahu would remain in place as prime minister. On the eve of the election, the Israeli leader declared that there would be no Palestinian statehood while he remained in office. It has become clear that Netanyahu, who just said that he is against a Palestinian state and that he plans to increase [Jewish] settlements if elected, will form the next government, Erekat told the Voice of Palestine radio. It is very clear that there is no partner in Israel for the peace process. The last round of peace talks broke down nearly a year ago, and while Netanyahus main opponent, Isaac Herzog, had pledged to try to re-engage the Palestinians, Netanyahu has made no such promise. He reiterated plans to press ahead with Jewish building in east Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state. Erekat said the election outcome proves the correctness of the Palestinian decision last year to join the International Criminal Court and sign onto other international treaties and organizations. Israel has denounced those moves as unilateral and punished the Palestinian Authority by withholding millions of dollars in tax revenue. Erekat and others predicted that Netanyahus election-eve repudiation of a 2009 speech in which had had accepted in principle a two-state solution would galvanize international support for the Palestinian cause. The entire world is going to be with us, Erekat said. Netanyahu said in interviews and campaign appearances on Monday, in advance of Tuesdays general elections, that his 2009 stance had become irrelevant because realities on the ground had changed.

Through a long night of vote-counting that began with exit polls suggesting a dead heat, Netanyahus conservative Likud Party opened a lead over his main rival, the left-center Zionist Union, that widened by dawn to five or six seats in the 120-member Knesset, or parliament. With more than 99% of the vote counted, the tally was 29 or 30 seats for Likud to 24 for the Zionist Union, according to tallies posted on Israeli news sites. A final count will take some days. Netanyahu, a consummate political survivor, had gone into Tuesdays vote trailing in opinion polls, and had painted even the deadlock suggested by exit polls as a victory. By dawn, his supporters were rejoicing deliriously over a turnabout that, if borne out in the final official tally, appeared to give him a clear mandate to seek to remain Israels leader, though he will still need to woo key political factions to do so. Addressing cheering, chanting supporters early Wednesday at his headquarters, Netanyahu declared that reality does not take time out.... The citizens of Israel expect us to swiftly form a responsible leadership that will work for them, and so we shall do. But the scorched-earth campaign waged by the prime minister and his backers pointed to political fissures that will probably emerge again. Initially, as the count was beginning, Isaac Herzog of the Zionist Union said he too would try to head a governing coalition. We will wait for the real results, he said. The people of Israel want change. As the hours went by, however, those hopes appeared dashed. The people have decided, loud and clear  Israel has spoken, said Nachman Shai, a senior lawmaker in Herzogs party. The people want a right-wing government, and got it. Throughout the campaign, the two candidates were a study in contrasts, not only in style and personality but also on the big issues confronting Israel. Herzog said he would try to engage the Palestinians and mend ties with Europe and the United States; Netanyahu sought to quash Palestinian statehood hopes and railed against foreign critics who he said were trying to unseat him. Reflecting voter passions, turnout was estimated to be even higher than the 68% in the last election, which was the highest in 16 years. Throughout the day, soldiers in rumpled uniforms, ultra-Orthodox Jews in long black coats and twentysomethings with nose rings made their way to polling stations across the country, sometimes waiting patiently in long lines. No single political party has ever captured a majority in the Knesset. So the popular vote is only the first step in the painstaking process of assembling a governing coalition. Netanyahu will need to build alliances with an array of smaller parties to achieve the 61 seats necessary to govern. Even the dead heat originally forecast in exit polls had represented a deeply disappointing outcome for the Zionist Union. Herzogs supporters had hoped that the lead of up to five seats, projected in the final opinion polls before the vote, would translate into a victory sufficiently commanding that the 54-year-old lawyer-politician would be asked by President Reuven Rivlin to form the next government. The president had expressed hope for a so-called unity government that would incorporate the rival factions. Netanyahu, however, has ruled out such a scenario. The Zionist Union, having put the campaign focus in the final days on ousting the prime minister, would be hard-pressed to embrace him, although Herzog said earlier he would talk to any party, including Netanyahus. As the exit polls were reported and the vote-counting began, the mood in the stunned crowd at Zionist Union headquarters was subdued, although Herzogs post-midnight appearance drew warm cheers. You put your heart and soul into this campaign, he told backers. Netanyahu in recent days had made a frantic push to retain support from conservative and nationalist voters amid signs the electorate had tired of him, and hardened already hard-line positions toward the Palestinians. On election eve, he declared that there would be no Palestinian state on his watch and that Jewish construction would continue in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state. On election day, he drew widespread criticism with a Facebook video declaring that voters from Israels Arab minority were descending en masse on the polls, a stance denounced as racist by his opponents. The preliminary picture painted by the exit polls illustrated a highly fragmented political scene that analysts predicted would make it difficult for either Netanyahu or Herzog to assemble a governing coalition or to keep that alliance from fracturing. But the later figures suggested Netanyahu would have a much more solid base on which to build. The preliminary tally pointed to a political landmark: A political alliance of Israeli Arabs, who normally distance themselves from the countrys political scene, emerged as the third-largest party in parliament. We are in the midst of a historic founding moment, said the alliances leader, Ayman Odeh, whose Joint List won up to 14 seats. The new government that emerges from this maneuvering will be faced immediately with daunting challenges at home and abroad: economic woes that played an outsized role in the campaign; a damaged relationship with the United States, Israels most important ally; and external threats such as Irans nuclear program, which Netanyahu sought to frame as the most crucial threat to Israels existence. Herzog had said he would attempt to engage diplomatically with the Palestinians. The prime ministers campaign had emphasized security issues, including the nuclear threat posed by Iran, while the center-left focused on social issues such as the soaring cost of living. To some, Netanyahus relentless focus on threats to Israel amounted to a scare tactic. Irit Neeman, a 58-year-old lawyer and talent agent, said she voted for the Zionist Union because Im fed up of living in fear. The prime ministers core supporters, however, remained loyal. In Tel Avivs open-air Carmel Market, traditionally a Likud bastion, 46-year-old Adi Hayek, who runs a stall selling cheap cosmetics and drugstore goods, said he would not turn away from Netanyahu now. Its Bibi or nothing, he said, referring to Netanyahu by his nickname.

{"Content": "[Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev borrowed a gun two months before the 2013 attack and \"kept coming up with excuses\" for not returning it, a close friend testified Tuesday. Prosecutors have identified the Ruger handgun as the gun used by Tsarnaev and his brother to kill a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer as they attempted to flee the area three days after the bombings. Stephen Silva testified that several weeks after he first showed Tsarnaev the gun, Tsarnaev asked if could \"potentially borrow\" it. \"He said he wanted to rip (rob) some kids from URI,\" Silva said, apparently a reference to the University of Rhode Island. Silva said that after a few weeks, he asked Tsarnaev for the gun back, but Tsarnaev repeatedly made up excuses for why he didnt return the gun. The bombing killed three people and injured more than 260 others. Testimony in the case began March 4. Tsarnaev, 21, faces the possibility of the death penalty if convicted. Silva, who was charged last year with possession of a gun with an obliterated serial number and drug charges, said Tuesday he was testifying against Tsarnaev as part of a plea agreement with prosecutors. He acknowledged that he is hoping prosecutors will recommend a sentence below five years. Silva appeared uncomfortable, sighing at times as he testified against the man he described as a close friend he had known since the eighth grade. Tsarnaev, seated at a table with his attorneys about 12 feet away from Silva, gave him several long looks during his testimony. During opening statements in the trial, Tsarnaevs lawyer admitted that he participated in the bombings, but said his older brother, Tamerlan, was the mastermind and recruited him to help. His lawyer said it was Tamerlan who used the gun to shoot MIT police Officer Sean Collier. But prosecutors, through Silvas testimony, established that Tsarnaev is the one who obtained the gun used in Colliers killing. During cross-examination, Tsarnaevs lawyer suggested again that Tamerlan was a domineering older brother and had a powerful influence over Dzhokhar. Attorney Miriam Conrad asked Silva if he knew why Dzhokhar had never introduced him to his brother. \"Did he tell you You dont want to meet my brother,\" Silva said. \"Yes,\" replied Silva. \"He said his brother was very strict ... very opinionated, and that since I wasnt a Muslim, you know, he might give me a little (expletive) for that.\", Prosecutors say the Tsarnaevs committed the bombings to retaliate against the U.S. for wars in Muslim countries. Silva recalled a discussion about American foreign policy during a high school class he had with Dzhokhar. Silva said Dzhokhar said U.S. foreign policy \"tends sometimes to be a little hostile toward the Middle East,\" persecutes Muslims and tries to \"take over peoples culture.\", Under questioning from Tsarnaevs lawyer, Silva said he didnt recall Tsarnaev ever making strong anti-American statements and had posted on Twitter in November 2012 that he was celebrating the re-election of President Barack Obama. The Ruger handgun was also used during a carjacking shortly after Colliers killing and during a shootout with police in Watertown. A Watertown police officer testified Monday that Tamerlan Tsarnaev threw the gun at him when he ran out of bullets. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died following the shootout and an escape by Dzhokhar, who ran him over as three police officers were trying to handcuff him on the ground. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hours later, hiding in boat parked in a Watertown backyard. On Tuesday, boat owner David Henneberry described how he discovered a wounded and bloodied Tsarnaev. On April 19, 2013, Henneberry said, he received a call asking all Watertown residents to \"shelter in place\" while police were conducting a door-to-door manhunt for Tsarnaev. He said after the restriction was lifted about 6 p.m. he looked outside and noticed that the shrink wrap on his boat looked a little bit loose. Henneberry said he put a ladder up against the boat, and when he looked inside, he noticed blood. \"I just kept fixating on this blood ... my eyes looked on the other side of the boat and thats when I saw a body on the boat,\" Henneberry said. It was Tsarnaev, lying on his side. The jury was shown more photographs of the inside of the boat, including a note Tsarnaev wrote in pencil on the interior walls. In the note, which prosecutors have characterized as a confession to the bombings, Tsarnaev denounced the U.S. for wars in Muslim countries. \"The US Government is killing our innocent civilians but most of you already know that,\" the note said. \"I cant stand to see such evil go unpunished, we Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all.\", Prosecutors also showed jurors two wooden slats where Tsarnaev carved the remainder of his note: \"Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop.\", Authorities Tuesday unsealed the results of a 28-page questionnaire given to potential jurors asking about their connections to the bombings, their media habits and religion. Jurors were asked if they knew anyone from Chechnya or Dagestan, where the Tsarnaevs came from. More than 1,300 received the questionnaires in January. Testimony is scheduled to resume Wednesday.

{"Content": "[Geneva school board candidates each see a particular issue that weakens District 304: Dwindling state funding; lack of emotional support for students; too few high schoolers exploring vocational careers. But all candidates agree the most immediate obstacles to be tackled are the districts burdening debt payments. \"I think we can overcome those if we do it right,\" said incumbent board member Mike McCormick, a tax attorney and managing partner at McCormick and Fimon. \"Its about looking at the abatement process, seeing where we have extra funds, using those funds to pay off the debt service and hopefully not having the taxpayers suffer consequences.\", Geneva residents will have seven choices, from longtime incumbents to a school counselor to the owner of a construction company, when they decide who will fill three open school board seats in the April 7 election. The winners will serve four-year terms on a board of seven. McCormick and board Vice President Kelly Novak are seeking re-election. Mary Stith, who has served on the board for 12 years, wants a fourth term. And four newcomers  Evelyn Schneider, Ann Murtaugh, Tina Yagla and Taylor Egan  hope to shake things up on the board with fresh ideas. The debt payments have candidates and current board members wrestling with how to handle them. The amount Geneva 304 will owe for the structures it built in recent years will climb dramatically from 2016 to 2019. Payments could reach as high as $23 million. Last month, the board voted to transfer more than $3.5 million from its education funds to cut down the debt service. Incumbents McCormick, Stith and Novak say the system theyve been using, in which the board prioritizes keeping the budget under control and continues to make decisions to avoid long-term debt, has proven successful. Stith said the establishment of a finance committee in recent years is already a step in the right direction. \"Were trying to figure out when well be able to take an amount of money and defuse some of the debt,\" she said. \"It might not be happening as fast as residents would like, including myself, but were making headway.\", But some challengers think a more formulated payment plan is necessary. \"Without careful planning, the citizens and people of the school board will be hit with harsh realities,\" said Yagla, the owner of Yagla Engineering Services in Geneva. \"Some of those bonds you cant refinance, and when those come due, well be faced with a pretty sizable debt payment over any operational cost that actually educates the students.\", Beyond debt payments, other issues candidates want to address are those directly affecting students, such as limited emotional and social services at schools. Egan, the PTO president at Mill Creek Elementary, feels emotional issues like stress and anxiety hinder a students ability to learn, and that teachers should be equipped to offer help to students within their classrooms. She also says full-time psychologists should be available at schools across the district, including elementary schools. \"Were seeing these emotional issues at such a young age now that its becoming key to try and catch them early on,\" Egan said. \"And in the long term, that support will help our district academically.\", Incumbent Stith, a former nurse, also hopes to improve emotional support, and said that while Geneva High School offers programming on bullying and depression, a students emotional issue could be as simple as them not feeling good about themselves. \"If kids arent good and stable emotionally, theyre not learning,\" she said. Incumbent Novak and Schneider, a guidance counselor at Glenbard East High School in Lombard, are both frustrated with the increasing number of unfunded mandates from the state. \"Weve done a good job of containing costs and cutting the budget where we can, but were seeing all these new initiatives coming at us,\" said Novak, a former banking professional. \"We need to be very involved in the state level, and regularly involved in advocacy.\", Schneider said the biggest issue with the mandates is the financial burden they put on the district. \"We want to keep taxes down, but we need to have a balance with what these kids are getting and whats appropriate for the community,\" she said. If elected, Murtaugh, a mother of three children who graduated from the district, and Yagla both hope to better promote vocational careers as valuable options for graduating high school students. Murtaugh says leftover grant money from the Fabyan Foundation, which funds several college scholarships to students each year, could go toward scholarships for two-year degrees at the Fox Valley Career Center. \"Students who are right on the edge about whether or not they can go for their associates degree should get scholarship funding,\" she said. \"That could make all the difference. It could make it or break it for some of these kids.\", Yagla says too few students take advantage of the career center, since it isnt emphasized as a post-graduate option as much as four-year colleges are. She said not attending a four-year college \"isnt the end of the world.\", \"Especially in a world of college debt, not everyone wants to go to college, or should,\" she said. \"I would like to see how we can make this a more attractive option to young people and take the stigma away.\", meltagouri@tribune.com, Twitter: @marwaeltagouri]", "Date": "20150317", "Title": "[For seven Geneva school board candidates, looming debt biggest issue]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com//suburbs/batavia-geneva-st-charles/news/ct-tri-school-board-election-geneva-304-tl-0319-20150317-story.html\n", "Author": "[Marwa Eltagouri]"}
{"Content": "[Alcohol versus marijuana: We demonize marijuana, but we glamorize alcohol. A lot of people smoke marijuana, but they smoke it inside their homes. Alcohol can be consumed just about anywhere, and it is okay. At presidential balls and governor balls, alcohol is always served. Alcohol kills more than any drug in America, whether through car accidents or barroom brawls. A young man has been convicted of killing a teacher in Naperville in a bar. It all happened in a drinking establishment. You dont see people smoking marijuana and fighting each other. Alcohol makes people violent and causes heart disease and cancer, yet we advertise it on television and in magazines. Dont you think our kids see this? Look at the frat parties. Kids out of control and drinking. We took cigarette ads out of magazines and television. Alcohol kills more than cigarettes. Cigarettes never make you get in your car and kill someone. I leave it up to you. You weigh it out and see what you come up with. Concern about old Copley Hospital: So the City of Aurora is demolishing Copley Hospital? That will be a nice expenditure of $10 million paid by the taxpayers. This building is important to many residents. Why wasnt it ever redeveloped? There was a senior living proposal presented in 1997, but it was to be voted down by the city council. They turned their back on a solid business plan with a sensible economic development incentive. At that time, the building was in good condition. Sadly, it is no longer. Over the past 20 years, why didnt the economic development department ever find a new developer? How about the professional preservationists? That group loves historic buildings. Why didnt the mayor and city council hire a competent consultant? There was enough time. Did everyone fail, or did anyone try? What a misplaced priority. Its easy to come up with incentives for newer sections of the city like the outlet mall and then congratulate each other at council meetings. Its harder to have success with older buildings with troubled ownership. We pay the mayor and his managers not to leave holes in our neighborhood and our hearts. Their failure with Copley makes me glad they will be shown the door in two years. Bothered about Beacon: I always thought this was The Aurora Beacon-News. Since the Chicago Tribune took it over, I guess its the Elgin, Geneva, St. Charles, Oswego and Yorkville News. We never see anything about Aurora anymore. Please bring back the Beacon-News like it was 25 years ago. Sounds of spring: The temperature is milder, the snow is finally melting, and the cars are already blaring their loud music. Welcome to warm weather in Elgin. Bobcat caught on camera: Can our news media describe anything that happens without saying what color the man was or what he had in his hand? I understand this bobcat was up in Wauconda. It was unarmed. I understand someone shot it with a camera. Was the guy doing the shooting black or white? Lets get it straight. A good t-shirt for Madison, Wisconsin, would read: Be Cool. Dont Be a Fool. Voter registration situation in Ferguson: Im calling about Anthony Stanfords good column on Ferguson, Missouri. I would like to point out an omission with regards to most coverage of Ferguson. What is happening with voter registration there? I suspect there is discrimination going on with voter registration as well otherwise the black majority would straighten out the situation at the polls. Republicans missing at Selma: Hello, Speak Out. I would like to ask what has become of my Republican friends and neighbors on the subject of Selma. The newspaper is full of news about Selma, but I didnt see any of them going there or speaking about it. I wonder if they have taken an oath or perhaps there is a code of silence. Rising real estate taxes: I see the people in Kane County are going to get a real estate tax bump up. Our lousy officials who are running this state ought to be fired, from the lowest office worker to the top executive. Funny how it never works that taxes go down. They always go up. They assumed that everything was going well. You should not assume anything when taxpayers money is involved. Lets get rid of this whole crowd. We have an election coming up. For anyone who is for cutting taxes, give them your vote. Never mind the rest. Turned off by utility company: I hope you appreciate the frugality of the utility company. When you get your utility bill from ComEd, remember that the CEO only gets $2.5 million. And Exelon, which owns ComEd, has its CEO earning $17 million. I hope you appreciate their frugality. Heroin heartbreak: This is about heroin and its effect on families. My sons ex-wife destroyed her family. She didnt work for 12 years. She stole jewelry, and she stole from me. Last time I saw her, she only weighed 80 pounds. She looked like a skeleton. This was a girl who was once beautiful. She chose heroin over her husband and two boys. The kids are going through hell. The 15-year-old is rebellious. This has taken such a toll on my health. We warned my son not to get involved with this woman. Now hes raising their sons. What a life. Keep a close eye on your family and warn them. Care for the kids: After I read the story about the slain teenager, I was more concerned for the four children living in a house that was shot at two times in four months. Children learn what they live. Why wasnt Department of Children & Family Services called in to take those children out of such a dangerous environment?, Roused about Republicans: What is wrong with the Republicans? They are undermining the president. Total disrespect. I have never seen anything like this in the history of the United States. Is this man hated this much? What is Benjamin Netanyahu doing over here? What does he hold over the Republicans? This is the same thing he did with Iraq. He convinced the United States that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. He was set on fighting with Iraq. If the Republicans win the presidency, God help us all. Frustrated about Ferguson: I would like to comment on Ferguson, Missouri. I think I have the perfect solution. All the white police officers should just quit and find jobs in other places. All the white businesses that were burnt down should just be left as they are. All the white residents should just get up and leave and move somewhere else. In about a year, Ferguson will probably look like Detroit. They dont quite understand whats going on. If the guy had just gotten off the street, none of this would have happened.

{"Content": "[Republican state Sen. Darin LaHood said hes interested in running in the special election to succeed U.S. Rep. Aaron Schock and could decide as soon as Wednesday. The son of Ray LaHood, a former Peoria congressman and U.S. transportation secretary, said its a sad day for the Peoria-area congressional district and that Schocks quick resignation took him by surprise. It was very, very sudden. And Ive been getting a lot of encouragement to look at the seat and to run for the 18th District,\" LaHood, of Dunlap, said at the Capitol in Springfield. \"I need to evaluate that with my family and my friends, but getting a lot of encouragement. Ill have a formal decision tomorrow on that.\", Also interested in the special election in the heavily Republican congressional district is state Sen. Jason Barickman of Bloomington. And state Sen. Bill Brady of Bloomington, who ran for Illinois governor three times, said he wont say no at this point to a potential congressional bid. Schocks resignation becomes official March 31, and once that happens, the governor will call a special election for Schocks Illinois district. State law requires the governor to set the date for a special election within five days. Primary and general elections would be held, and by law the congressional seat must be filled within 120 days. The district stretches from Bloomington on the east through Peoria to Quincy on the west. Its an overwhelmingly Republican district after a redistricting that took place after the 2010 census. Barickman says he is considering a run but needs to discuss it with his family. \"I think today is a reminder of the tremendous responsibility we all have as public officials, for the trust that we are given by the people we are asked to represent. So in that context, I think many of us are both stunned by todays news but disappointed in the set of circumstances that led to today, he said. \"In the context of whats next, I think we first need to see what the process is. As I understand it theres a special election soon. But this is something that Ill consider in the context I need to discuss it with my family, we have a young family at home, I want to discuss it with them and discuss it with my supporters and then Ill make a decision from there.\", The LaHood name is very well known in Peoria, which is the center of the district. \"Listen, this is a district thats a very Republican district,\" LaHood said. \"There will be a lot of qualified people that want to get involved in it. I dont take anything for granted. But I will stand on my record in my four years in the state Senate and the work I did for my constituents, but this is a large district, 19 counties. Five of my counties are currently included in that, but I dont take anything for granted.\", Brady, best known for narrowly losing the governors race to Democrat Pat Quinn in 2010, has some name recognition. \"Obviously, anytime something like this comes down this way, its a tragedy and its just not a good thing,\" Brady said. \"But well make the most of it and make sure we get a strong Republican to fill that vacancy.\", Asked if he plans to be that Republican, Brady replied:\"I have been asked that, and I am flattered by people who say I should. And I am not going to say no, but I am going to tell you that I really enjoy my job as a state senator, especially now with a Republican governor. I am very happy where Im at, but I am not going to say no. \"It depends on what names emerge, and some considering are my good friends. Well see. Ive been around the circuit. It wont take me long to decide,\" Brady added. Also Tuesday, Illinois Republicans wasted little time distancing themselves from Schock after his resignation in the midst of questions about his travel and office expenses. The ethics questions were not lost on Republicans back home, including Illinois Republican Chairman Tim Schneider. \"Honesty and integrity are of utmost importance when serving the public, Schneider said in a statement. Today is an unfortunate day for the people of the 18th Congressional District, the state of Illinois and the Illinois Republican Party.\", Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, who didnt always get along with Schock, was brief. This is a sad day for the people of Illinois and the 18th District, the governor said in a statement his office released. The tension between Schock and Rauner stemmed from Schocks exploration of a run for Illinois governor. Schock accused Rauner of being behind TV and radio ads running in the Peoria market critical of Schocks vote for a measure that ended the so-called fiscal cliff by boosting federal taxes on wealthier Americans. Rauner has said he has nothing to do with the ads. Schock opted not to run for governor and Rauner won last fall. The two apparently had patched things up enough that Schock had a small role in the Illinois inauguration ceremony in January. State Rep. David Leitch, a Peoria Republican who said he recruited Schock to run for the Illinois House more than a decade ago, said he was surprised by the resignation. My sense was he probably had sufficient political strength to continue, said Leitch, who indicated he has not spoken to Schock in several years. At the same time, it was obvious that more and more questions were arising about different aspects of his public service. It will be interesting to learn more about his decision.\", \"I think its very sad that a person with that much ability has inflicted so much damage on himself,\" Leitch added. In Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel was asked to weigh in on Schocks resignation. The mayor, President Barack Obamas first White House chief of staff, noted that Schock opposed Obamacare. I would say he was wrong for the future of the city of Chicago, Emanuel said. Illinois has had special congressional elections three times in recent years in which candidates faced the challenge of quickly ramping up campaign efforts. In late 2007, former Republican Speaker Dennis Hastert resigned about a year after losing the House to the Democrats. In an upset, Democrat Bill Foster defeated Republican Jim Oberweis in the special election in the spring and then held the seat that fall in a rematch. In late 2008, then-Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel resigned effective Jan. 2 to become Obamas White House chief of staff. Cook County Commissioner Mike Quigley emerged from a crowded Democratic primary and went on to win the general election in the 5th Congressional District in spring 2009. And in late 2012, Democratic U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. resigned from Congress amid a federal probe. Robin Kelly won the Democratic primary and general election in the 2nd Congressional District in spring 2013.]", "Date": "20150317", "Title": "[Darin LaHood, Brady could run to succeed Schock]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com//news/local/politics/chi-rauner-to-set-special-election-for-schock-seat-20150317-story.html\n", "Author": "[Monique Garcia]"}
{"Content": "[A controversial south suburban activist is running for a seat on a school board from which hes made hundreds of thousands of dollars suing. Komaa Mnyofu, a Rich Township High School District 227 board candidate, is also a convicted felon who was found guilty in 1999 of child abduction under another name: Tyler Jones. Mnyofu was convicted in a bench trial after he took his child from a park and didnt return his son for two weeks, court records show. After the Tribune contacted Mnyofu this month about his conviction, he said he would call the paper but did not. He then requested written questions due to his \"busy campaign schedule\" and \"being under the weather.\" Mnyofu subsequently declined to comment in an email. Two days after the Tribune first contacted Mnyofu, he published a blog confirming his conviction. He blamed the guilty finding from the judge on institutional racism. \"I was guilty of protecting my 12-year-old son, a crime dating all the way back to slavery when black parents were stripped of their children and faced with death for any attempt to protect their children or prevent their forced removal,\" Mnyofu wrote on his blog, Eye of the Storm 227. Current School Board President Cheryl Coleman, who is running for re-election, said news of Mnyofus conviction came as a shock. Coleman called on Mnyofu, whose name appears first on the ballot in his race, to stop campaigning. \"I think he should do whats honorable for the community and not pursue it because that takes us through more litigation, more trouble, if he were to get elected,\" Coleman said. The Cook County clerks office confirmed that convicted felons cannot be elected officials in Illinois. In the past year, south suburban Thornton Township High Schools District 205 endured a legal battle over whether a convicted felon who had his conviction expunged in Indiana could serve on the board. In December, it was determined the man could not. Mnyofu is no stranger to Coleman or the school district. The Southtown newspaper reported in 2013 that Mnyofu had sued the district before, costing it hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees. He also had received $340,000 in settlements from the south suburban school district. Mnyofu said in court records that he has been involved with at least 16 lawsuits, including a complaint against two Cook County judges and another against a police officer who gave him a traffic ticket across the border in Indiana. In 2010, he filed a lawsuit claiming he was kicked out of school board meetings for criticizing the selection of a new superintendent. Another lawsuit filed by Mnyofu against the district in the early 2000s claimed he was retaliated against for objecting to \"homosexual safe zones\" instituted at one of the districts schools. In a recent interview, Coleman expressed concerns about Mnyofus temperament. \"Its very scary to have somebody in the No. 1 (position on the ballot) whos been found guilty of a felony with child abduction,\" Coleman said. Mnyofu has previously run for election to the school board but was unsuccessful. District 227 serves students from Chicago Heights, Country Club Hills, Matteson, Olympia Fields, Park Forest, Richton Park, Tinley Park and University Park. On the blog, Mnyofu said he took his son after the child showed bruises. The judge found that keeping the child out of school and not returning him to his mother \"showed specific intent to avoid the terms of the visitation and custody court order,\" an appeals record shows. He was sentenced to 30 months of probation, records show. Mnyofu claims the judge wanted to punish him for being a \"smart uppity\" African-American, although Mnyofu used the N-word on his blog. Although Mnyofu did not return a message asking why he was running to be on the school board, he has called the board \"dysfunctional.\" Mnyofu also made it clear on his blog that he has no intention of halting the campaign. He compared himself on the blog to Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Harold Washington and Country Club Hills Ald. Victor Watts, who was involved in a battle over a felony conviction in the late 1990s. \"I too will survive these cowardly and hypocritical efforts to smear and use my ... past pain as a political weapon to neutralize the voters of Rich Township District 227 from choosing their own school board members,\" Mnyofu wrote. gpratt@tribpub.com, Twitter @royalpratt]", "Date": "20150317", "Title": "[Rich Township High School board candidate a convicted felon]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com//suburbs/daily-southtown/news/ct-school-board-felon-met-20150317-story.html\n", "Author": "[Gregory Pratt]"}
{"Content": "[I am a proud union member as was my father. Today, more than ever I realize the need for union representation. The union negotiates a contract between management and the employees, which puts everybody on the same level. From that point on, the company as well as the employee knows where they stand on all issues. Any differences are then arbitrated. I dont see the problem companies are having with that. The American worker needs a union as much today as we did years ago to protect our wages, benefits and the futures of us, our families and our country. Unions fought for 40-hour work weeks, paid vacations, health care benefits and pensions. Those were not given to us by generous employers. George S, Burbank, To Paul from Tinley Park, may I suggest that you and all your bleeding-heart liberals volunteer 50 percent of your income to the state. My guess is that you are one of those feeding at the taxpayer trough. We are bankrupt as a state because politicians for decades gave away future benefits to public unions to stay in power, benefits that the taxpayers could not support. Now your chickens are coming home to roost. If Cook County and Chicago filed for bankruptcy, that would wipe out almost all the future liabilities. Crook County politicians and their union bosses have controlled Illinois for as long as I can remember. Illinois is taking in record revenue and cant pay its bills. Its the spending stupid. Tom from Mokena, Chicago Cubs President Theo Epstein said the $52 million contract given to pitching bust Edwin Jackson was a \"mistake.\" However, he qualified the gaffe by saying, \"But to Edwins credit, hes shown up every day and worked hard.\" Isnt it great to be involved in pro sports? You can \"show up and work hard\" and pull down a cool $52 million even if you are grossly inept. Also, if you are a major part of making such stupid decisions as this contract, you can \"own up\" and just move on to the next one. Evergreen Park, Scott Reeders column about much being at stake with the Illinois Supreme Courts pension reform ruling couldnt have said it better  its time for the elected officials to start looking out for all of the Illinois taxpayers!, Lockport, I wonder if any Democratic politician can talk, rant or rave against Republicans without somehow commenting about how Republicans dont care about the middle class. My question is, other than at election time, when the Democratic politicians want and need the middle-class vote, do they really do anything or actually care about their darling middle class?, Bob, Oak Forest, To Terrmiester, you are another person who doesnt know you-know-what from shinola. You must be a true follower of Fox \"News.\" At the time, what Hillary Clinton was doing regarding her email account was completely legal and aboveboard. Willow Springs, Any voter who thinks red-light cameras should be the No. 1 topic in Chicagos mayoral election is not thinking straight. Maybe its about time more drivers observe traffic regulations. If they have to be fined a few times to knock some sense into them, I say that the cameras are a good thing. Im tired of cars speeding down my side street (a school is on the next block) and slamming on their brakes because of a stop sign at the corner, which most people barely stop at. I can add to this drivers who pull around me when Im sitting at a red light, and after pausing, go through because theyre tired of waiting; drivers who drive on my tail, honking their horns or flashing their lights because Im only driving at/slightly over the speed limit; drivers who pull around me and then cut me off because I actually dared to stop at a stop sign. If the red-light cameras cause any of these knuckleheads to drive even close to properly, I say put up more!, El, Chicago, The only difference between Jackie Robinson West and many other Little League organizations is that JRW got caught. The town my sons played in for Little League could have written the book on underhanded back-door dealings. I now joke that the worst of the team learned politics in Little League and then went on to become the mayor. JK, Speak Out allows readers to comment on the issues of the day.

{"Content": "[The issue took up a significant chunk of discussion time, but not all the questions Wilmette Park Board candidates fielded at a March 14 candidate forum were about the boards lakefront master plan. Nor was all the discussion about the two bond referendums the board hopes will pass in order to fund that plan. Newcomer Ryrie Pellaton and incumbents Gary Benz, Jim Crowley and Shelley Shelly also talked about park district user fees, how much reserves the district should have and how much debt it should carry, whether commissioners should turn their eyes to the Sheridan Shores Yacht Club building, and the desirability of promulgating environmental education through district programs. Still, the contentious referendum generated most of the differences between opponent Pellaton and the incumbents, who back the $12.7 million Gillson Park bond question and the smaller $1.8 million Langdon Park bond question that will join them on the April 7 ballot. The League of Women Voters event at Wilmette Village Hall attracted a healthy crowd. Only one candidate in the race to win four board seats, newcomer Stephanie Foster, was unable to take part. Crowley, a 24-year board veteran and his one-term colleagues Benz and Shelly presented a unified pro-referendum message. The financial plan behind the bond questions is sound, each said. The renovation and building programs at Gillson and Langdon do not appreciably increase the amount of concrete along the lakefront, Crowley said. \"We dont believe in blacktopping the world,\" he said. \"The idea that were just throwing concrete down there is really misleading.\", Shelly told listeners that much of the work is federally mandated by the Americans with Disabilities Act and must start this year, while Benz touted master plan proposals for walking paths, butterfly gardens, and additional natural and native plantings. Pellaton, who is part of the Save Wilmette Lakefront anti-referendum campaign, questioned their claims and decried what he called a lack of imagination by current board members as they pursued the lakefront plan. Pellaton said that voting against the referendums  which he urged listeners to do  \"wouldnt preclude us from doing a different referendum for a different amount of money, for a different scope of project.\", When asked what the board would do if the referendums fail, Crowley said project work would go forward in \"bits and pieces over a longer period of time. It would be robbing Peter to pay Paul.\", He and Shelly also said they would support doing little or nothing at tiny Langdon Park, if the referendums fail. \"I would prioritize making Gillson ADA-compliant,\" Shelly said. Despite being on opposite sides of the referendum question, candidates were sometimes closer on other questions. Benz told questioners who wanted to know what level of debt the district should shoulder that \"the appropriate level of debt is what the voters agree to,\" while Pellaton said, \"I dont think its rational to think they wont have any debt, although minimizing it is a good idea.\", All four candidates said the park board should consider the possibility of bidding for the Sheridan Shores Yacht Club building lease when the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District renews the lease in 2016. All four also said such consideration would have to be very careful. \"There are issues  regarding our lakefront park land that can be handled by private organizations,\" rather than government bodies like the park board, Benz said, referring to the park boards 2013 decision against trying to take over management of Wilmette Harbor. All four candidates support making the park district a place to learn about environmental issues such as the Great Lakes basin. Crowley suggested if the park board did acquire the yacht club building lease, it might be a good site for such educational efforts. The candidates also said they would support reviewing the districts user fee structure, which provides about 65 percent of the districts revenue. While they all agreed that non-resident user fees might be worth increasing, Pellaton pointed out that the district cant deny park access to non-residents, \"and I dont think we should.\", In opening and closing statements, the candidates tried to highlight their own strengths and board aims. \"I continue to have no agenda, other than the belief that parks should be maintained for all citizens,\" Benz said. Shelly, who is a fervent supporter of the districts new paddle tennis facility, also said she and her family have used many park district programs. \"As a parent and user of park district facilities, I understand the needs of the users of Wilmette,\" she said. Pellaton said one of his priorities is increasing communication with Wilmette residents through a survey. \"I hope to be elected, whether or not the referendum passes, to offer my insight,\" he said. Crowley, who said he would provide continuity on the board if elected, said he hopes to reach out to the recently fire-gutted Womans Club of Wilmette. He said at least one of the freshman candidates and perhaps both will be elected, adding, \"I vow to support you no matter what.\", He also offered a diplomatic message to voters: \"We dont often have a contested election where two sides have such passion, and that leads to a better informed electorate.\", To access the Wilmette LWV voters guide, with information on all four district candidates, visit lwvwilmette.org/files/voters_guide_2015_.pdf.
