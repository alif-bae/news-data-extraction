{"Content": "[Democratic Rep. Bill Foster said Tuesday he is seriously considering a challenge to Sen. Mark Kirk in 2016, calling the Republican senators signature on a open letter to the government of Iran \"incredibly irresponsible.\", Kirk, who has long advocated tough treatment of Iran, was among 47 Republican senators to sign on to the letter, which warned that any nuclear deal negotiated by the Obama administration could expire the day the president leaves office. Official talks to curtail Irans nuclear activities are ongoing. Democratic critics of the GOP letter charge that it interferes with the presidents execution of foreign policy. Foster, 59, of Naperville, served in the House from 2008 to 2011, lost a re-election bid in 2010 but won a seat again in 2012. He is a Harvard-educated physicist who formerly worked for Fermilab and has tapped his personal wealth in past electoral campaigns. In a statement, Foster said:, \"I am seriously considering running for the United States Senate because I believe that voters deserve the strongest possible alternative to Sen. Kirk. Just recently, with his signature on the incredibly irresponsible letter to the government of Iran, weve seen Sen. Kirk put his own politics ahead of the interests of our state and our country. Its time Sen. Kirk is replaced with someone who will put Illinois first.\", Kirk, 55, served in the House nearly 10 years before his election in 2010 to the Senate. Foster is among a handful of Democrats mulling a run against him. Others includes House Democrats Tammy Duckworth of Hoffman Estates, Robin Kelly of Matteson and Cheri Bustos of East Moline. kskiba@tribpub.com, Twitter @KatherineSkiba]", "Date": "20150317", "Author": "[Katherine Skiba]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-bill-foster-mark-kirk-2016-election-20150317-story.html", "Title": "[U.S. Rep.
