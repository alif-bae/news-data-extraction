{"Content": "[Disgraced political insider Antoin \"Tony\" Rezko was released from federal prison in downstate Pekin on Tuesday and transferred to a halfway house in the Chicago area, authorities said. Rezko was sentenced to 10 1/2 years for extorting millions of dollars from firms seeking state business or regulatory approval while he was a top fundraiser and adviser to then-Gov. Rod Blagojevich. He was furloughed Tuesday morning, according to Ed Ross, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Rezko was convicted in 2008 of using his clout with Blagojevich and scheming with another political insider to extort money from firms. He had already served almost 3 1/2 years in prison when he was formally sentenced at the end of 2011. \"I always believed he would be a model prisoner,\" said his attorney, Joe Duffy. \"The Bureau of Prisons reached the same conclusion and released him to a halfway house so he can start transitioning back into society.\", Rezko, an immigrant with an American rags-to-riches story, also pleaded guilty in October 2010 to a separate federal fraud charge over the bogus sale of his pizza restaurants. Over the years, Rezko raised money for scores of local politicians, including Mayor Harold Washington and President Barack Obama. Rezkos release from custody is slated for May 5, 2016, according to Ross. Under terms of his furlough, Rezko must receive permission to leave the halfway house, Ross said.
