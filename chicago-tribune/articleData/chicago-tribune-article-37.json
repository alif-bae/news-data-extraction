{"Content": "[Chicago Cubs Vice President of Sales & Partnerships Colin Faulkner and his wife last month paid close to $1.8 million for a newly built house in Wilmette. Faulkner, 39, joined the Cubs front office in 2010, overseeing ticket sales and service and introducing dynamic pricing for Cubs tickets. He expanded his duties in 2013 to include managing relationships with the Cubs business partners. Faulkner and his wife bought the home in Wilmette in a private transaction from a homebuilder who last summer paid $635,000 to buy the 103-year-old, American Foursquare-style house on the 0.17-acre property. The builder then demolished that vintage house to construct a new home. Because the Faulkners new house sold in a private transaction, it was not listed in the real estate multiple-listing service. As a result, no details are available about its features. Faulkner and his wife previously had owned a four-bedroom, 4,007-square-foot Tudor-style house in Elmhurst, which they sold last month for $1.037 million. Faulkner told Elite Street that he and his wife decided to move from Elmhurst to Wilmette for both work and personal reasons. \"We bought the house to be closer to Wrigley Field (to reduce our commute time), and we liked the neighborhood, the town and the house for our family,\" Faulkner told Elite Street in an email.
