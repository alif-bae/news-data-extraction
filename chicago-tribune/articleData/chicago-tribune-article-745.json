{"Content": "[For years, St. Paul United Church of Christ in Barrington has supported the lesbian, gay and bisexual community, said Kathleen Bolger, church council president. She also said St. Paul has included that community, as well as the questioning, queer and intersex people, as full members in worship and leadership. Bolger offered those comments Friday just hours after the U.S. Supreme Court voted 5-4 to allow same-sex marriages in the United States. \"So, it is wonderful to have the validation in the civic sphere of that which we, as Christians at St. Paul, have practiced in the religious sphere,\" she said. \"The understanding that we all are beloved by God and that all people have the right to commit oneself in love and marriage to another person, equally,\" she said. Gay and lesbian couples were already permitted to marry in 36 states. However, the courts historic decision now means the remaining 14 states must halt bans on same-sex marriage. Bolger said her church congregation did not have an \"official stamp vote\" to affirm the LGBT community. \"But we have performed civil unions and weddings for those couples.\", A Palatine resident, Bolger said St. Paul served 70 congregants each week and it was more than 150 years old. \"At St. Paul, we have a diversity of theological and political thought in our community, but we take to heart the authority given by Jesus to his followers to wrestle with scripture and to try to understand how God is speaking to us today,\" she said. tshields@pioneerlocal.com, @tshields19]", "Date": "20150702", "Author": "[Todd Shields]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/barrington/news/ct-bcr-gay-marriage-vote-tl-0702-20150630-story.html", "Title": "[Barrington church leader praises gay marriage ruling]"}
