{"Content": "[Republican presidential hopefuls seem to be trying to outdo each other in making bombastic and outrageous statements. Donald Trump claims John McCain wasnt really a war hero and Mike Huckabee likens the Iran nuclear treaty to a new Holocaust for Israel. These are dangerous proclamations. It is as if the candidates are talking before they think about the contents of their words. Of course they all want to become president in 2016. Perhaps they think such wild talk will appeal to the voters. But I am reminded that our Constitution makes the president commander in chief of the armed forces. This means that the president acting on his own volition could order nuclear missiles to be fired on any nation he believes or imagines to be our dire foe. Will the Republicans aggressive and, I think, irresponsible speeches be translated into action if one of them manages to gain the White House? I dont know the answer, but it sure is a scary thing to think about. R.
