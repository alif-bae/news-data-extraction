{"Content": "[Republican presidential candidates Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and Donald Trump called Friday for an end to a ban on service members carrying guns in military recruiting offices. The ban became an issue after a man killed four Marines and wounded a sailor and another Marine on Thursday at a pair of military facilities in Chattanooga, Tennessee. \"It seems to me that if you have military bases or recruiting offices, these are symbols of American might, theyre targets,\" Bush said after a town hall-style event in Carson City, Nevada. Shooting rampage in Tennessee that killed 4 Marines was an ISIS inspired attack according to the Head of Homeland Security. July 17, 2015. (WGN-TV), Shooting rampage in Tennessee that killed 4 Marines was an ISIS inspired attack according to the Head of Homeland Security. July 17, 2015. (WGN-TV), \"This is how you garner attention. You go to places where theres vulnerability, and its a very powerful symbolic attack on our country,\" said Bush, a former governor of Florida. Walker, Wisconsins governor, echoed Bushs position while campaigning in Iowa. \"I think with ISIS now and the threats that we have not only abroad, but domestically, when our military in particular is potentially a target, we need to make sure that in places like this, a recruiting facility, theyre able to be armed so our heroes are protected,\" Walker said. Attending a state GOP fundraiser in Hot Springs, Arkansas, Trump said the Chattanooga shooting showed the need for ending \"gun-free zones\" at military facilities. \"This sick guy had guns and shot them down,\" the businessman and reality TV star told reporters. \"These are decorated people. These are people who could have handled guns very easily. They would have had a good chance if they had a gun. ... If these Marines yesterday, the four of them, had guns they probably, at least some of them, would be with us today.\", A gunman unleashed a barrage of fire at a recruiting center and another U.S. military site a few miles apart in Chattanooga, Tenn. on July 16, 2015. Bush said the attacks should prompt the U.S. to heighten national security and \"deal with the rest of the world in a more aggressive way.\" He said Congress would need to act for the gun ban at recruitment centers to be repealed. \"If the Marines were armed, I think people wouldve known that, and if they had known it, maybe they wouldnt have come in,\" he said. \"Who knows. I just think it ought to be reviewed, for sure.\", On Friday, Gen. Ray Odierno, chief of staff of the Army, said that security at military recruiting and reserve centers would be reviewed but that it was too early to say whether the facilities should have security guards or other increased protection. He told reporters that arming troops in those offices could cause more problems than it might solve.
