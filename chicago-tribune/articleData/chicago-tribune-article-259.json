{"Content": "[Gov. Bruce Rauner went back on the road Wednesday to sell his turnaround agenda\" to local voters, laying the blame for the states financial troubles on the legislatures Democratic leaders as he encountered angry jeers from some who risk losing state services if the two sides dont reach a deal. The new governor is doubling down on a strategy to win approval of his pro-business, anti-union legislative agenda by asking voters to pressure their state lawmakers to vote his way. That campaign consumed much of Rauners first few months in office, but he returned to the Capitol in mid-May as the scheduled end of the session approached and Democrats rejected his agenda and pushed forward with their own budget plan thats more than $3 billion short. Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan at a press conference on June 10, 2015, said, \"I pledged to work professionally with Governor Rauner.\" (WGN TV), Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan at a press conference on June 10, 2015, said, \"I pledged to work professionally with Governor Rauner.\" (WGN TV), With the stalemate still unresolved and tensions rising in Springfield, Rauner took to Decatur on Wednesday to renew his grass-roots appeal, this time with pointed criticism of House Speaker Michael Madigan and Senate President John Cullerton, the Democrats who have refused to go along with Rauners demands. Im here to ask your help, Rauner told a mostly friendly crowd gathered outside a restaurant on the shore of Lake Decatur. I would like you to reach out to every member of the General Assembly who represents this area ask them, where do they stand? Do they stand with the Chicago machine and Madigan and Cullerton and the political class thats driven us into the ditch for the last 12years?, It was largely the same speech Rauner has given in dozens of towns and cities since January, but with a heavier emphasis on Madigan and Cullerton --- and a reference to disgraced, imprisoned ex-Gov. Rod Blagojevich. Lets be clear whats going on here. Madigan and Cullerton work for the Chicago machine, just like Blagojevich did. Theyre all part of that Chicago machine. Thats where they come from. Thats where they make their money. Theyre not really working for you. Theyre working for the Chicago machine. After FBI agents arrested Blagojevich at his Ravenswood Manor home in December 2008, Madigans House impeached Blagojevich and Cullertons Senate removed the governor from office. Its not the first time Rauner has tried to link Madigan and Cullerton to Blagojevich. During the governors race last year, Rauner aired a TV ad blaming the Democratic trio plus then-Gov. Pat Quinn for being in Springfield for more than 100 years collectively. \"A hundred years of failure is enough,\" the narrator said in the ad. For their part, Madigan and Cullerton have compared Rauners negotiating tactics in dealing with the General Assembly to Blagojevich. \"It is true that there have been certain actions taken by Gov. Rauner which clearly look like the things that were done by Rod Blagojevich when he was in office, and I just dont think Illinois needs Rod Blagojevich back on the scene,\" Madigan told WGN-AM 720 on May 31. Madigan also has accused Rauner of acting in the extreme in tying a new budget to the governors agenda. On Tuesday, Rauner said that Madigan and Cullerton have a conflict of interest because of ties to law firms that appeal Cook County property tax assessments. In response to the criticism, Madigan read aloud his personal code of conduct, which states that the speaker will not offer state benefits to get a client, will not intercede with a state agency for a client and will recuse himself from involvement in a bill if a client of the law office expresses an interest in legislation such as to create a conflict of interest. That code of conduct first surfaced in 2010 as the Chicago Tribune published the first in its series of stories called The Madigan Rules, showing clients of the speakers property tax appeals law firm, Madigan & Getzendanner, have benefited from state projects he helped secure. The investigation also showed that Madigan made decisions as speaker that affected the fortunes of many companies that put money in his pocket as clients of his law firm. National ethics experts interviewed by the Tribune said Madigans stated ethics policy does little to address his many conflicts of interest as the states most powerful lawmaker. Last year, a separate Tribune investigation into the speakers patronage army documented how more than 400 current or retired employees at every level of state and local government work elections for Madigan, donate regularly to his campaign funds, register voters for him or circulate candidate petitions on his behalf. The investigation also found repeated instances in which Madigan took personal action to get them jobs, promotions or raises. The speaker was asked Tuesday about Rauners conflict of interest comments. If I were in a private meeting with the governor today, I would simply say to the governor, Governor, Ive been advised of your comments today. I simply want to say to you that for my part, Im going to continue to be professional about what we do here, Madigan said after Tuesdays overtime session. Im speaking for myself. Ive been through these things before, and I know that name-calling and accusations dont do any good through the legislative process and for solving the No. 1problem facing the state, which is the budget deficit.\", Since the legislatures scheduled adjournment May 31 came and went without a budget agreement, Rauner has cast the impasse as a battle between taxpayers versus the insiders in Illinois. Not everybody sweating it out at the midday event was buying Rauners argument. Renee McAfee and Annie Yarbary, child care workers whose clients rely on state subsidies, waved signs opposing Rauners agenda and shouted out as he delivered his speech and took questions from reporters. We need this budget passed. We need for you, Madigan, Cullerton, whoever, to get it together, Yarbary told Rauner during a chat after the event. Quit fighting over there like 2-year-olds and stand up for the people of Illinois. Well said, I agree, Rauner replied. But Yarbary wasnt done. What are your terms and plans in terms of balancing this budget, not on the backs of our children or our seniors? Yarbary asked. Rauner reiterated his request that concerned voters talk to their representatives in Springfield and ask them to support his agenda. I already have, Yarbary said. Theyre saying that we need to find revenue. The exchange illustrated the stalemate at the Capitol. Rauner insists that he is unwilling to discuss options for raising money to prevent deep cuts to state programs unless Democrats first agree to his agenda items, which include freezing property taxes, setting term limits on elected officials, changing the way political maps are drawn and changes to the workers compensation and civil lawsuit systems. Madigan has said that Rauner is negotiating from an extreme position and should not use the need for a budget to leverage his legislative agenda. Last week, the administration announced plans to freeze spending on safety net programs in the absence of a budget deal. That includes a freeze on enrollment for child care subsidies offered to working low-income parents and provided by people like McAfee and Yarbary. kgeiger@tribpub.comTwitter@kimgeiger]", "Date": "20150610", "Author": "[Kim Geiger]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-rauner-ratchets-up-rhetoric-against-madigan-cullerton-amid-impasse-20150610-story.html", "Title": "[ Rauner ratchets up rhetoric against Madigan, Cullerton amid impasse]"}
