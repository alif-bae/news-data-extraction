{"Content": "[Villa Park Village President Deborah Bullwinkel announced plans Tuesday to run for the Democratic House nomination in the 8th Congressional District. Bullwinkel joins Raja Krishnamoorthi of Schaumburg and state Sen. Michael Noland of Elgin in trying to succeed U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth. The two-term congresswoman is vying for the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Mark Kirk, who is seeking re-election. Bullwinkel, 47, is in her first term as village president of the DuPage County suburb after first being elected to the Village Board in 2009. In announcing her congressional bid, she stressed her gender while attacking the Republican-controlled House. \"Every day, politicians in Congress zealously attack middle-class families and women. Whether it is fair wages and pay equity, economic opportunity for the middle class, paid family leave, or access to good health care and reproductive rights, extremist Republicans in Congress will fight any positive change,\" Bullwinkel said in a statement. \"If youre a working person, and especially if youre a woman, the assault never stops. I wont back down from that fight,\" she said. State Sen. Tom Cullerton, a predecessor of Bullwinkels in Villa Park village government, briefly sought the congressional nomination in the west and northwest suburban district before withdrawing at the end of July. rap30@aol.com, Twitter @rap30]", "Date": "20150825", "Author": "[Rick Pearson]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-villa-park-mayor-duckworth-seat-congress-met-0826-20150825-story.html", "Title": "[Democrat Bullwinkel says she'll run for Duckworth seat]"}
