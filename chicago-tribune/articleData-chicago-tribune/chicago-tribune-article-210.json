{"Content": "[ Donald Trump visited the Tribune Editorial Boardon Monday, and his voice has been rattling around in my brain ever since. Hes a disarming conversationalist with one noticeable tic: Almost any topic becomes an opportunity for him to reference his own talents and accomplishments. Many of these comments were asides or bite-size nuggets of opinion. As I listened and scribbled notes on a legal pad, Trumps thoughts began to look like haiku, the Japanese three-line poems in which the first and third lines have five syllables, while the middle line has seven. Using some poetic license to finish them, heres what I heard Trump the presidential candidate say:, Mexicans, I love Mexicans. I sell many apartments, to people from there. *, The border, The borders a mess. Trump has turned out to be right. Rough hombres. Rough stuff. *, Jobs, Id take back our jobs. Id take back things nobody, is talking about. *, Iran, On the Iran threat:, Im 99 percent sure, I can make a deal. *, Crime (in four parts), You have to take care, of the crime situation. These are tough, tough kids. -, Youve got to be tough. What would I do about it?, You need tough cookies. -, When I was 18,, in Brooklyn, at White Castle,, The cops, they had sticks. -, Youd have no problem. Gang members were petrified. I would be so tough. *, Blagojevich, A very nice guy, but not sophisticated. Got a rough sentence. *, Iraq, In 2004, I said, \"Dont invade Iraq.\", I should get credit. *, ISIS, My plan for ISIS?, Id rather not say the plan. Take away the oil. *, Reagan, I admired Reagan. He knew me and he liked me. I have lots of friends. *, Hillary, Im the only one, who can beat Hillary. Why?, Because I know her.
