{"Content": "[ Luis Lang would like you to send him some money. He has taken to GoFundMe,the crowdfunding website, trying to raise $30,000. Lang, who is 49 and lives in Fort Mill, S.C. is slowly losing his eyesight to diabetes. Without surgery, hell go blind. Those grim facts notwithstanding, some may not find Lang the most sympathetic candidate for charity. In the first place, as some observers noted after reading about him in a Charlotte Observer story by Ann Doss Helms, he has a $300,000 home and a wife who doesnt work; why, they ask, cant he raise the money from them?, In the second place, Lang has had diabetes for years, but has not always followed doctors advice to control it. In the third place, hes a smoker who is still smoking despite his bleak prognosis. But theres a bigger reason some may find it difficult to feel his pain and therein lies a tale. It seems Lang, who is a Republican, knew the Affordable Care Act  the dreaded Obamacare  required him to buy health insurance, but he refused to do so. He figured he was making a pretty good living as a self-employed handyman and prided himself on paying his own medical bills. Then came 10 days of grinding headaches, an emergency room visit and a diagnosis that hed suffered a series of ministrokes. Then came $9,000 in medical bills, an empty savings account, bleeding in his eyes, a partially detached retina and an inability to work. DURHAM, N.C. The Obamacare subsidies saved my life. Now, Im scared the U.S. Supreme Court is going to gut them. In 2010, at 54, I was diagnosed with non-alcoholic cirrhosis (end-stage liver disease). Its debilitating, and a transplant is the only cure. At that time, I owned a jewelry store with... DURHAM, N.C. The Obamacare subsidies saved my life. Now, Im scared the U.S. Supreme Court is going to gut them. In 2010, at 54, I was diagnosed with non-alcoholic cirrhosis (end-stage liver disease). Its debilitating, and a transplant is the only cure. At that time, I owned a jewelry store with... At which point he tried to buy him some Obamacare only to discover that he was outside the open enrollment period and that with zero income, he makes too little to get a federal subsidy that would help him buy a private policy. Obamacare offers expanded Medicaid coverage to help people like him, but South Carolina is one of 21 Republican-led states that have refused to participate in that program. So Lang is, well  out of luck. And who does he blame for that state of affairs? Well obviously, its President Barack Obamas fault for passing flawed legislation. You see, though he refused to buy coverage, Lang thought it would be available to him in an emergency. His wife, Mary, feels he should be at the front of the line, because he doesnt work and because he has medical issues. Which is not unlike refusing to buy auto insurance, but expecting Geico to sell you a policy after you total the Toyota. Still, if Lang doesnt exactly tug at your heart like baby seals do, he is getting traction. At this writing, hes over halfway to his goal, most of it raised from liberals taking the occasion to rip his and his partys failings. Many skip the donation and go straight to the scorn. Just how stupid does Paul Ryan think we are?, The Wisconsin Republican and two other House committee chairmen claim in a recent op-ed for the Wall Street Journal that they are just about ready to propose an Obamacare \"off-ramp\" if the Supreme Court decides in King v. Burwell to destroy the federal... Just how stupid does Paul Ryan think we are?, The Wisconsin Republican and two other House committee chairmen claim in a recent op-ed for the Wall Street Journal that they are just about ready to propose an Obamacare \"off-ramp\" if the Supreme Court decides in King v. Burwell to destroy the federal... Sorry, writes Joel, Im way too busy thinking only about myself. Call Mitt Romney or Jeb Bush, writes Jeannie, they have plenty of money. I want to donate enough to really help you out, writes Ed, but I cant figure out how to get GoFundMe to accept bootstraps. Langs response? It turned into a political thing, he complained. That wasnt my intention when I reached out. But how could it not be political? Langs party claimed health care reform would send death panels after Nana, that self-reliance could cure cancer, that emergency rooms provided all the health care poor people need. In a nation of government-funded police, fire departments, schools, libraries and road maintenance, it argued that government-funded health care was somehow a moral crime. Lang apparently bought it all. Now, the bill comes due, and whatever he thought of Obamacare as a model for financing health care, surely Lang must concede that GoFundMe is even worse. Yet, thats the fix he finds himself in. So yes, hed like you to send him some money. Do what you can.
