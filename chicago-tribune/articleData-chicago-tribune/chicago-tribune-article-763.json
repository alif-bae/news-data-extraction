{"Content": "[ U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly said Friday she wont seek the Democratic Senate nomination next year and instead will run for re-election from her South Side and south suburban district. Kelly, who was elected in April 2013 following the resignation of then-Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. said she had received an abundance of support and encouragement across the state but wanted to work on the unfulfilled promise of her district. There is a strong desire among the people of Illinois for new leadership in the U.S. Senate, for fresh ideas on how to expand access to opportunity for Illinois families, Kelly, of Matteson, said in a statement. I will work with my fellow Democrats to ensure that the people of Illinois have representation in the Senate that reflects their values and vision for a better future, she said. Kellys decision leaves U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth of Hoffman Estates and former Chicago Urban League president and CEO Andrea Zopp as the only two major announced candidates to seek the Democratic nomination for the Senate seat held by Republican Mark Kirk, who is seeking re-election.]", "Date": "20150612", "Author": "[ Rick Pearson]", "Link": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-rep-kelly-wont-run-against-duckworth-for-democratic-us-senate-nomination-20150612-story.html", "Title": "[ Rep.
