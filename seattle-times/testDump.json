{"Content": "[Republicans have made the Mountain West a stronghold, which is why brewing party brawls in Wyoming, Idaho and Utah are bedeviling loyalists who yearn for GOP unity. Closely watched elections this month in Virginia and New Jersey did little to resolve the growing struggle between tea partyers and the Republican establishment. Now, some of the sharpest infighting is shifting to the rugged Big Sky region, where the tea party scored its first major victory, ousting a veteran Republican U.S. senator in a Utah party convention three years ago. We have to have this fight, said U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, an Idaho Republican facing a tea party challenger next May as he seeks a ninth House term. The struggle will continue well into the next presidential race, he said. Simpson and three-term U.S. Sen. Mike Enzi from neighboring Wyoming are chief targets of tea party and anti-establishment groups that prize ideological purity above all, even if it leads to legislative defeats. Its not enough, these groups say, that both men hold top ratings from conservative organizations such as the National Rifle Association. Republicans run little risk of losing congressional races to Democrats in Idaho, Wyoming and Utah. But if longtime incumbents such as Simpson and Enzi can fend off their GOP challengers next year, the results conceivably could lessen the tea partys zeal and reputation nationwide. That might encourage mainstream Republicans such as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie who are considering running for the White House in 2016. On the other hand, a new string of tea party victories could ignite a full-blown Republican civil war and embolden anti-establishment champions such as U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. All across the country, Republicans are watching to see where big donors, especially from the business world, will put their money and energy. In Idaho, the Club for Growth is backing Simpsons challenger, lawyer Bryan Smith. The group helped topple GOP incumbents last year, including longtime U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, whose seat eventually fell to a Democrat. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which sometimes spars with the Club for Growth, has yet to say which candidates it will support. Simpson, however, was a featured speaker at a chamber event this month in Washington, D.C. If nothing else, next years congressional elections in the Rockies hold the potential for fierce, even nasty confrontations between elected Republicans and their challengers. In Wyoming, its time for a new generation of leaders, says Liz Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney. Her differences with Enzi, 69, seem largely stylistic and generational. She calls Barack Obama the most radical president ever. The soft-spoken Enzi rarely employs such bombast, even if he routinely opposes Obamas initiatives. Cheneys decision to oppose Enzi has dismayed many prominent Republicans and opened painfully personal rifts. Her father is a hero to many Wyoming conservatives. But many other well-known Republicans, including U.S. Sen. John Barrasso and former U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson, have rallied to Enzis side. Enzis supporters call Cheney, who lived for years in Virginia, a carpetbagger and opportunist. They gleefully point to her early missteps, including a late property tax payment and a $220 fine involving her application for a fishing license reserved for longtime state residents. Cheney is airing a TV ad that calls her five children fifth-generation Wyomingites. In Idaho, Mike Simpson is a burly, cigarette-smoking dentist whose district sprawls eastward from Boise to the Wyoming-Utah border, nearly 300 miles away. Snow-streaked mountains tower above hard-pressed former railroad towns and tourist-driven ski and snowmobile resorts. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney beat Obama here by a 2-to-1 margin in 2012. Simpson, a more gregarious talker than Smith, likes to say, Ill put my conservative credentials against anybodys. He notes that he voted 40 times to halt or delay Obamas health care law. But unlike Idahos other three members of Congress, Simpson didnt vote to continue last months partial government shutdown beyond 16 days. Tea partyers insisted the shutdown go on, even though it was hurting the Republican Partys image. They also note that Simpson joined House GOP leaders 11 months ago in backing a resolution that raised taxes on the rich, but not on the remainder of Americans. Those were common-sense agreements that averted worse outcomes, Simpson said at a suburban coffee shop in Boise, the states biggest city. Because nearly all Republicans strongly oppose higher taxes, increased regulations and the presidents health care law, he said, the partys split is over strategy, not philosophy. The next two elections, Simpson said, will determine whether the Republican Party is going to be a governing majority, or whether were going to resign ourselves to be an ideologically pure minority. That sounds like surrender to Smith. The incumbent, he says, is part of Washingtons go along to get along crowd. In interviews and public settings, Smith sticks to tea party talking points. On a recent blustery night in a bare-bones meeting hall in southeastern Idaho, Smith told a small gathering its impossible to defund the health law as long as Democrats control the Senate and White House. Nonetheless, he said, he proudly sides with those who are willing to stand up and fight for conservative principles, even if their efforts have no legislative chance. Smith, whose speaking style is earnest and deadpan, has yet to prove he can raise enough money and excitement to beat Simpson. But some conservative state legislators, including Idaho Rep. Janet Trujillo, support him. Trujillo rejects claims that Republicans cant win presidential elections unless they temper their rhetoric on social issues, especially when addressing minority, female and young voters. The party is going to have to get back to its conservative roots, she said, and candidates such as Smith can help do that. The GOPs internal angst in the West also reaches U.S. Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. Hes the one who rocked Republican circles in 2010 by ousting U.S. Sen. Robert Bennett in a state party convention. Lee accused Bennett of being too conciliatory with Democrats. Establishment Republicans, including big fundraisers for Romney, are openly criticizing Lees recent take-no-prisoners tactics, including his doomed efforts to bar money for what Republicans call Obamacare. Lees Senate website now depicts a bridge symbolizing efforts to close the gaping hole in the Republican Party that separates the grass roots from establishment leaders. Trent Clark, a former Idaho GOP chairman, says the loss of manufacturing and ranching jobs in many Western areas contributes to social unease and an openness to the tea partys throw out the hierarchy message. Many Idahoans detest a $17 trillion federal debt, he said, and they feel there is no more room for compromise in Washingtons budget talks. But Republicans who refuse to cut the best possible deals with Democrats, Clark said, are not being strategic. He said he backs politicians such as Simpson who can make some headway on these issues. Thats the idealism vs. pragmatism decision that millions of Republican voters must make in upcoming primaries. It already troubles Dennis Turner, one of the 18 people who showed up for Smiths public forum in Montpelier this month. At 81, Turners face is as craggy as the land he ranched and farmed until two years ago. His conservatism is just as deeply etched. He told Smith that the United Nations is trying to take over, with the help of our president, and ruin the Second Amendment and take our guns from us. That makes Turner a true-blue tea partyer and Smith supporter, right? Maybe not. In an interview, Turner said he generally likes Smiths politics, but he thinks Simpson has done a good job in Congress. If Smith replaces Simpson as the Republican nominee, Turner said, Democrats might have a chance to win the seat, even in Idaho. Asked whether he prefers Simpson or Smith, Turner thought a moment and said, I wouldnt make that call just now. ___, Follow Charles Babington on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cbabington]", "Date": "2013-11-18 04:19:00", "Title": "[\n      GOP infighting fierce even in Western strongholds      ]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/politics/gop-infighting-fierce-even-in-western-strongholds/", "Author": "[]"}

They gleefully point to her early missteps, including a late property tax payment and a $220 fine involving her application for a fishing license reserved for longtime state residents. Cheney is airing a TV ad that calls her five children fifth-generation Wyomingites. In Idaho, Mike Simpson is a burly, cigarette-smoking dentist whose district sprawls eastward from Boise to the Wyoming-Utah border, nearly 300 miles away. Snow-streaked mountains tower above hard-pressed former railroad towns and tourist-driven ski and snowmobile resorts. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney beat Obama here by a 2-to-1 margin in 2012. Simpson, a more gregarious talker than Smith, likes to say, Ill put my conservative credentials against anybodys. He notes that he voted 40 times to halt or delay Obamas health care law. But unlike Idahos other three members of Congress, Simpson didnt vote to continue last months partial government shutdown beyond 16 days. Tea partyers insisted the shutdown go on, even though it was hurting the Republican Partys image. They also note that Simpson joined House GOP leaders 11 months ago in backing a resolution that raised taxes on the rich, but not on the remainder of Americans. Those were common-sense agreements that averted worse outcomes, Simpson said at a suburban coffee shop in Boise, the states biggest city. Because nearly all Republicans strongly oppose higher taxes, increased regulations and the presidents health care law, he said, the partys split is over strategy, not philosophy. The next two elections, Simpson said, will determine whether the Republican Party is going to be a governing majority, or whether were going to resign ourselves to be an ideologically pure minority. That sounds like surrender to Smith. The incumbent, he says, is part of Washingtons go along to get along crowd. In interviews and public settings, Smith sticks to tea party talking points. On a recent blustery night in a bare-bones meeting hall in southeastern Idaho, Smith told a small gathering its impossible to defund the health law as long as Democrats control the Senate and White House. Nonetheless, he said, he proudly sides with those who are willing to stand up and fight for conservative principles, even if their efforts have no legislative chance. Smith, whose speaking style is earnest and deadpan, has yet to prove he can raise enough money and excitement to beat Simpson. But some conservative state legislators, including Idaho Rep. Janet Trujillo, support him. Trujillo rejects claims that Republicans cant win presidential elections unless they temper their rhetoric on social issues, especially when addressing minority, female and young voters. The party is going to have to get back to its conservative roots, she said, and candidates such as Smith can help do that. The GOPs internal angst in the West also reaches U.S. Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. Hes the one who rocked Republican circles in 2010 by ousting U.S. Sen. Robert Bennett in a state party convention. Lee accused Bennett of being too conciliatory with Democrats. Establishment Republicans, including big fundraisers for Romney, are openly criticizing Lees recent take-no-prisoners tactics, including his doomed efforts to bar money for what Republicans call Obamacare. Lees Senate website now depicts a bridge symbolizing efforts to close the gaping hole in the Republican Party that separates the grass roots from establishment leaders. Trent Clark, a former Idaho GOP chairman, says the loss of manufacturing and ranching jobs in many Western areas contributes to social unease and an openness to the tea partys throw out the hierarchy message. Many Idahoans detest a $17 trillion federal debt, he said, and they feel there is no more room for compromise in Washingtons budget talks. But Republicans who refuse to cut the best possible deals with Democrats, Clark said, are not being strategic. He said he backs politicians such as Simpson who can make some headway on these issues. Thats the idealism vs. pragmatism decision that millions of Republican voters must make in upcoming primaries. It already troubles Dennis Turner, one of the 18 people who showed up for Smiths public forum in Montpelier this month. At 81, Turners face is as craggy as the land he ranched and farmed until two years ago. His conservatism is just as deeply etched. He told Smith that the United Nations is trying to take over, with the help of our president, and ruin the Second Amendment and take our guns from us. That makes Turner a true-blue tea partyer and Smith supporter, right? Maybe not. In an interview, Turner said he generally likes Smiths politics, but he thinks Simpson has done a good job in Congress. If Smith replaces Simpson as the Republican nominee, Turner said, Democrats might have a chance to win the seat, even in Idaho. Asked whether he prefers Simpson or Smith, Turner thought a moment and said, I wouldnt make that call just now. ___, Follow Charles Babington on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cbabington]", "Date": "2013-11-18 04:19:00", "Title": "[      GOP infighting fierce even in Western strongholds      ]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/politics/gop-infighting-fierce-even-in-western-strongholds/", "Author": "[]"}
{"Content": "[Republicans have made the Mountain West a stronghold, which is why brewing party brawls in Wyoming, Idaho and Utah are bedeviling loyalists who yearn for GOP unity. Closely watched elections this month in Virginia and New Jersey did little to resolve the growing struggle between tea partyers and the Republican establishment. Now, some of the sharpest infighting is shifting to the rugged Big Sky region, where the tea party scored its first major victory, ousting a veteran Republican U.S. senator in a Utah party convention three years ago. We have to have this fight, said U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, an Idaho Republican facing a tea party challenger next May as he seeks a ninth House term. The struggle will continue well into the next presidential race, he said. Simpson and three-term U.S. Sen. Mike Enzi from neighboring Wyoming are chief targets of tea party and anti-establishment groups that prize ideological purity above all, even if it leads to legislative defeats. Its not enough, these groups say, that both men hold top ratings from conservative organizations such as the National Rifle Association. Republicans run little risk of losing congressional races to Democrats in Idaho, Wyoming and Utah. But if longtime incumbents such as Simpson and Enzi can fend off their GOP challengers next year, the results conceivably could lessen the tea partys zeal and reputation nationwide. That might encourage mainstream Republicans such as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie who are considering running for the White House in 2016. On the other hand, a new string of tea party victories could ignite a full-blown Republican civil war and embolden anti-establishment champions such as U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. All across the country, Republicans are watching to see where big donors, especially from the business world, will put their money and energy. In Idaho, the Club for Growth is backing Simpsons challenger, lawyer Bryan Smith. The group helped topple GOP incumbents last year, including longtime U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, whose seat eventually fell to a Democrat. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which sometimes spars with the Club for Growth, has yet to say which candidates it will support. Simpson, however, was a featured speaker at a chamber event this month in Washington, D.C. If nothing else, next years congressional elections in the Rockies hold the potential for fierce, even nasty confrontations between elected Republicans and their challengers. In Wyoming, its time for a new generation of leaders, says Liz Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney. Her differences with Enzi, 69, seem largely stylistic and generational. She calls Barack Obama the most radical president ever. The soft-spoken Enzi rarely employs such bombast, even if he routinely opposes Obamas initiatives. Cheneys decision to oppose Enzi has dismayed many prominent Republicans and opened painfully personal rifts. Her father is a hero to many Wyoming conservatives.

{"Content": "[WASHINGTON (AP)  It took Ted Cruz three months to raise $10 million for his campaign for president, a springtime sprint of $1,000-per-plate dinners, hundreds of handshakes and a stream of emails asking supporters to chip in a few bucks. One check, from one donor, topped those results. New York hedge fund magnate Robert Mercers $11 million gift to a group backing the Texas Republicans White House bid put him atop a tiny group of millionaires and billionaires whose contributions already dwarf those made by the tens of thousands of people who have given to their favorite presidential candidate. An Associated Press analysis of fundraising reports filed with federal regulators through Friday found that nearly 60 donations of a million dollars or more accounted for about a third of the more than $380 million brought in so far for the 2016 presidential election. Donors who gave at least $100,000 account for about half of all donations so far to candidates presidential committees and the super PACs that support them. The review covered contributions to outside groups that can accept checks of any size, known as super PACs, and to the formal campaigns, which are limited to accepting no more than $2,700 per donor. The tally includes donations from individuals, corporations and other organizations reflected in data filed with the Federal Election Commission as of Friday, the deadline for super PACs to report for the first six months of the year. That concentration of money from a small group of wealthy donors builds on a trend that began in 2012, the first presidential contest after a series of court rulings and regulatory steps that created the super PAC. They can openly support candidates but may not directly coordinate their actions with their campaigns. We have never seen an election like this, in which the wealthiest people in America are dominating the financing of the presidential election and as a consequence are creating enormous debts and obligations from the candidates who are receiving this financial support, said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a Washington-based group that wants to limit money in politics. Others see an upside to the rainmakers. Big money gives us more competitive elections by helping many more candidates spread their message, said David Keating, director of the Center for Competitive Politics, which advocates for fewer campaign finance limits. For any number of reasons, these donors are willing to give so generously. Some may have a business that stands to gain from an executive branch that changes how an industry is regulated, while others hope for plum administration assignments, such as a diplomatic post overseas or a cabinet position. Many say their contributions, which the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized as equivalent to free speech, merely reflect their intense belief in a particular candidate  and in the political system in general. Id think that the fact that Im willing to spend money in the public square rather than buying myself a toy would be considered a good thing, said Scott Banister, a Silicon Valley investor who gave $1.2 million to a super PAC helping Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul in the Republican presidential race. The voters still, at the end of the day, make the decision, he said. You can spend $1 billion trying to tell the voters to vote for a set of ideas they dont like, and they will still vote against the candidate. For Florida developer Al Hoffman, financial support of the states former governor, Jeb Bush, is personal. A longtime friend and political contributor to the Bush family, he gave $1 million to Bushs super PAC, contributing to its record-setting haul of $103 million in the first six months of the year. Hoffman was ambassador to Portugal during former President George W. Bushs second term. He said he sometimes offered Bush advice during his time as Floridas governor, but doesnt expect to influence a Jeb Bush administration. Id just like to see one, he said. While the existence of high-dollar donors is more pronounced on the Republican side, theyre also among those giving to the super PAC backing Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton. Seven donors of at least a million dollars accounted for almost half of the total collected by Priorities USA Action. Entertainment mogul Haim Saban and his wife, Cheryl, led with a $2 million gift, and hedge-fund billionaire George Soros, historically one of the Democratic Partys biggest givers, donated $1 million. But no one has capitalized on the new era of big money like Bush. After announcing plans to explore a presidential run in December, Bush embarked on a nearly seven-day-a-week travel schedule to raise money for his Right to Rise super PAC. Bush navigated limits on how candidates can raise money for super PACs by playing coy about his intentions. Now that he is officially a candidate, he has left Right to Rise in the hands of his trusted strategist and friend, Mike Murphy. Hes not alone in the use of super PACs to fuel a presidential run. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker are too new to the presidential contest, announcing only weeks ago, to have filed any reports about their campaigns finances. Yet super PACs that sprang up months ago to support them show their efforts will be financially viable: A group backing Christie raised $11 million, while two supporting Walker brought in $26 million. Such totals put them well ahead of Paul, former technology executive Carly Fiorina, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Sen. Rick Santorum  who all began their presidential campaigns in the spring. Cruzs super PACs, meanwhile, didnt just get the $11 million from Mercer. They also received a $10 million donation from Toby Neugebauer, an energy investor in Texas, while the Texas-based Wilks family pooled together a $15 million gift. Super PACs will spend as campaigns do, investing in polling and data sets, hiring employees in key states and buying pricey television and digital advertising, direct mailings and phone calls to voters.

{"Content": "[WASHINGTON (AP)  It took Ted Cruz three months to raise $10 million for his campaign for president, a springtime sprint of $1,000-per-plate dinners, hundreds of handshakes and a stream of emails asking supporters to chip in a few bucks. One check, from one donor, topped those results. New York hedge fund magnate Robert Mercers $11 million gift to a group backing the Texas Republicans White House bid put him atop a tiny group of millionaires and billionaires whose contributions already dwarf those made by the tens of thousands of people who have given to their favorite presidential candidate. An Associated Press analysis of fundraising reports filed with federal regulators through Friday found that nearly 60 donations of a million dollars or more accounted for about a third of the more than $380 million brought in so far for the 2016 presidential election. Donors who gave at least $100,000 account for about half of all donations so far to candidates presidential committees and the super PACs that support them. The review covered contributions to outside groups that can accept checks of any size, known as super PACs, and to the formal campaigns, which are limited to accepting no more than $2,700 per donor. The tally includes donations from individuals, corporations and other organizations reflected in data filed with the Federal Election Commission as of Friday, the deadline for super PACs to report for the first six months of the year. That concentration of money from a small group of wealthy donors builds on a trend that began in 2012, the first presidential contest after a series of court rulings and regulatory steps that created the super PAC. They can openly support candidates but may not directly coordinate their actions with their campaigns. We have never seen an election like this, in which the wealthiest people in America are dominating the financing of the presidential election and as a consequence are creating enormous debts and obligations from the candidates who are receiving this financial support, said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a Washington-based group that wants to limit money in politics. Others see an upside to the rainmakers. Big money gives us more competitive elections by helping many more candidates spread their message, said David Keating, director of the Center for Competitive Politics, which advocates for fewer campaign finance limits. For any number of reasons, these donors are willing to give so generously. Some may have a business that stands to gain from an executive branch that changes how an industry is regulated, while others hope for plum administration assignments, such as a diplomatic post overseas or a cabinet position. Many say their contributions, which the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized as equivalent to free speech, merely reflect their intense belief in a particular candidate  and in the political system in general. Id think that the fact that Im willing to spend money in the public square rather than buying myself a toy would be considered a good thing, said Scott Banister, a Silicon Valley investor who gave $1.2 million to a super PAC helping Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul in the Republican presidential race. The voters still, at the end of the day, make the decision, he said. You can spend $1 billion trying to tell the voters to vote for a set of ideas they dont like, and they will still vote against the candidate. For Florida developer Al Hoffman, financial support of the states former governor, Jeb Bush, is personal. A longtime friend and political contributor to the Bush family, he gave $1 million to Bushs super PAC, contributing to its record-setting haul of $103 million in the first six months of the year. Hoffman was ambassador to Portugal during former President George W. Bushs second term. He said he sometimes offered Bush advice during his time as Floridas governor, but doesnt expect to influence a Jeb Bush administration. Id just like to see one, he said. While the existence of high-dollar donors is more pronounced on the Republican side, theyre also among those giving to the super PAC backing Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton. Seven donors of at least a million dollars accounted for almost half of the total collected by Priorities USA Action. Entertainment mogul Haim Saban and his wife, Cheryl, led with a $2 million gift, and hedge-fund billionaire George Soros, historically one of the Democratic Partys biggest givers, donated $1 million. But no one has capitalized on the new era of big money like Bush. After announcing plans to explore a presidential run in December, Bush embarked on a nearly seven-day-a-week travel schedule to raise money for his Right to Rise super PAC. Bush navigated limits on how candidates can raise money for super PACs by playing coy about his intentions. Now that he is officially a candidate, he has left Right to Rise in the hands of his trusted strategist and friend, Mike Murphy. Hes not alone in the use of super PACs to fuel a presidential run. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker are too new to the presidential contest, announcing only weeks ago, to have filed any reports about their campaigns finances. Yet super PACs that sprang up months ago to support them show their efforts will be financially viable: A group backing Christie raised $11 million, while two supporting Walker brought in $26 million. Such totals put them well ahead of Paul, former technology executive Carly Fiorina, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Sen. Rick Santorum  who all began their presidential campaigns in the spring. Cruzs super PACs, meanwhile, didnt just get the $11 million from Mercer. They also received a $10 million donation from Toby Neugebauer, an energy investor in Texas, while the Texas-based Wilks family pooled together a $15 million gift.

The tally includes donations from individuals, corporations and other organizations reflected in data filed with the Federal Election Commission as of Friday, the deadline for super PACs to report for the first six months of the year.

Rand Paul in the Republican presidential race. The voters still, at the end of the day, make the decision, he said. You can spend $1 billion trying to tell the voters to vote for a set of ideas they dont like, and they will still vote against the candidate. For Florida developer Al Hoffman, financial support of the states former governor, Jeb Bush, is personal. A longtime friend and political contributor to the Bush family, he gave $1 million to Bushs super PAC, contributing to its record-setting haul of $103 million in the first six months of the year. Hoffman was ambassador to Portugal during former President George W. Bushs second term. He said he sometimes offered Bush advice during his time as Floridas governor, but doesnt expect to influence a Jeb Bush administration. Id just like to see one, he said. While the existence of high-dollar donors is more pronounced on the Republican side, theyre also among those giving to the super PAC backing Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton. Seven donors of at least a million dollars accounted for almost half of the total collected by Priorities USA Action. Entertainment mogul Haim Saban and his wife, Cheryl, led with a $2 million gift, and hedge-fund billionaire George Soros, historically one of the Democratic Partys biggest givers, donated $1 million. But no one has capitalized on the new era of big money like Bush. After announcing plans to explore a presidential run in December, Bush embarked on a nearly seven-day-a-week travel schedule to raise money for his Right to Rise super PAC. Bush navigated limits on how candidates can raise money for super PACs by playing coy about his intentions. Now that he is officially a candidate, he has left Right to Rise in the hands of his trusted strategist and friend, Mike Murphy. Hes not alone in the use of super PACs to fuel a presidential run. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker are too new to the presidential contest, announcing only weeks ago, to have filed any reports about their campaigns finances. Yet super PACs that sprang up months ago to support them show their efforts will be financially viable: A group backing Christie raised $11 million, while two supporting Walker brought in $26 million. Such totals put them well ahead of Paul, former technology executive Carly Fiorina, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Sen. Rick Santorum  who all began their presidential campaigns in the spring. Cruzs super PACs, meanwhile, didnt just get the $11 million from Mercer. They also received a $10 million donation from Toby Neugebauer, an energy investor in Texas, while the Texas-based Wilks family pooled together a $15 million gift. Super PACs will spend as campaigns do, investing in polling and data sets, hiring employees in key states and buying pricey television and digital advertising, direct mailings and phone calls to voters. Their money will be important in early primary states, but also would allow those with deep-pocket backers to campaign beyond Iowa and New Hampshire.

Drivers without a vehicle-mounted toll pass will get a bill in the mail. Theres a lot to learn, and state officials hope to prevent the opening day frustrations that gripped Atlanta in 2011, when the toll lanes were empty and the general lanes packed, leading the governor to order the $5.40 toll lowered. Craig Stone, assistant secretary for tolling for the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), said the initial prices on I-405 may be quite low, to encourage people to give tolls a try. Here are answers to help you adjust to the big change and avoid sudden lane changes, bills and surcharges:, Q: How do express toll lanes work?, A: Solo drivers may enter the left-side lanes, and escape the clogged general lanes, for whatever price is posted on overhead signs. The more congested the freeway is overall, the higher the toll to enter the express lanes. The states goal is a 45 mph flow in the express toll lanes. Drivers must weigh the value of time they might save. Q: Whats new on the road?, A: One new express toll lane was paved in each direction from Bothell to Bellevue, while the old carpool-transit lanes from Lynnwood to Bellevue are being converted to express toll lanes  so there will be two toll lanes each direction for the Bothell-Bellevue segment. There will be one toll lane each way from Lynnwood to Bothell. Q: How much will it cost to drive?, A: Tolls will range from 75 cents to $10 per trip, under an algorithm expected to set typical rates close to $4 during the busiest hour of a normal weekday. A commuter leaving downtown Bellevue might pay $2 to reach Totem Lake in Kirkland, $3 to reach Bothell, $4 to reach I-5 at Lynnwood. In recent tests, the toll price for the full 17-mile corridor rose from 75 cents to $1.25 as speeds dropped to 50 mph, and hit $2.50 near 45 mph, when early morning commuters showed up in the carpool lane (which will become an express lane). Cars lacking a toll pass, regardless of how many people are inside, will have their license plates photographed and get a bill in the mail for the trip, plus a $2 per-trip surcharge. Another option is to register your license-plate number with the state, so its linked to a toll-debit account. These drivers pay a surcharge of 25 cents per trip. Q: How will I know the toll price? Can I find out before I turn onto the freeway?, A: The toll price will appear on signs over the freeway, before the entry points to the toll lanes. Toll prices also will be posted above some streets in downtown Bellevue and Totem Lake, where drivers enter using direct, median onramps. Q: What if the toll changes during my drive?, A:The price displayed when you enter the toll lanes is what you will pay. Q: Do carpools travel free?, A: With at least three people in a car, toll lanes are always free, even during the 5 to 9 a.m. and 3 to 7 p.m. weekday peak hours. A two-person carpool may enter for free only during off-peak hours. But to claim that free, carpool status, vehicles must have a new FlexPass in the windshield. Q: Why mess with two-person carpools?, A: The states toll-pricing consultants projected in 2013 that allowing free two-person carpools at peak would crowd the toll lanes, and thwart efforts to modulate traffic speeds by using variable prices. (Keep in mind there will still be only a single express toll lane each way from Lynnwood to Bothell, and theyve been slow with two-person carpools.), Q: What about motorcycles?, A: Motorcyclists may use I-405 toll lanes for free, but need a motorcycle-style Good to Go pass, to signal the toll cameras to skip them. Otherwise, they will get a toll bill including $2 surcharges in the mail. Tolls are charged to motorcyclists on the 520 and Tacoma Narrows bridges, though. Q: Will I-405 tolls work like the Highway 167 HOT lanes in Kent?, A: There are differences. Highway 167 always lets two-person carpools enter HOT (high-occupancy or toll) lanes for free. And theres no camera tolling on 167, where state troopers issue citations to solo drivers who lack a windshield Good to Go pass. Q: Why do this?, A: Commute times during peak hours are unpredictable, averaging 45 minutes and occasionally exceeding 70 minutes, for the 17 miles. Speeds often sink below 45 mph, crippling bus transit. The new I-405 layout should assure quicker trips for buses and carpools, while giving solo drivers an option to reach urgent appointments quickly  for a price.  The whole system is set up to make 405 as a whole more reliable, Stone said. Detractors call them Lexus lanes, favoring affluent people who can afford tolls. Thats especially sensitive in Washington, which has been ranked as having the nations most regressive tax structure. Stone acknowledges higher-income people use them more, but said, Even the lower-income groups, they want to be able to do that  If I dont get to my job site on time, I dont get to work. Q: How do I enter?, A: There are seven marked, legal access points northbound, eight southbound.  These include the T-shaped median interchanges in downtown Bellevue and at Totem Lake, as well as dotted-line lane markings on I-405 itself. Otherwise, the toll and general-traffic lanes are separated by a double white line. The penalty for crossing in the wrong place is $136, enforced by state troopers. Q: Will my old Good to Go pass work?, A: Yes. Drivers can pay the posted price to enter the toll lanes using a normal Good to Go transponder, usually a green, bandage-sized sticker in the windshield. But they cant use it to claim free carpool status. Free trips require a special FlexPass. Q: Why do I need a FlexPass to carpool?, A: The new FlexPasses contain transponders that communicate with toll equipment. They send a signal that nullifies the overhead cameras, so they dont take a photo of the license plate, and you dont get a bill by mail. This pass, the size of a candy bar, can be flipped to white TOLL mode to pay, or to red HOV mode for free carpool travel. The state is offering free FlexPasses to people who are registered carpoolers, or who sign up, through rideshareonline.com. The older, two-mode carpool passes WSDOT issued for Highway 167 wont work on I-405. People who have those can upgrade to  a free FlexPass, good on all WSDOT tollways, for free. Otherwise, the new FlexPass costs $15. To activate the FlexPass, users must have or create a toll-debit account with the state. (See information box accompanying this story to learn how.), Carpools are charged a toll on the Highway 520 and Narrows toll bridges. Q: Will my tinted windshield block the pass?, A: About 1 percent of vehicles have metallic windows that will block the toll passes, in which case their license plates will be photographed for toll bills. A few car models include clear areas on which to stick electronic passes.  WSDOT doesnt have a solution. For now, if a windshield-mounted FlexPass doesnt work, drivers may call customer service to declare afterward that they were carpooling and deserve a free trip. The state is looking at other ideas, like a phone app to let drivers claim carpool status. Solo drivers who have metallic windshields can simply obtain a license-plate mounted type of Good to Go pass, then use the toll lanes at their normal price. Q: What if I drive I-405 toll lanes without a pass?, A: The states toll contractors will photograph your license plate, search a multistate database, and send a bill by mail  with a $2 surcharge, similar to how business is done for the Highway 520 toll bridge. British Columbia drivers arent tolled because the province and state lack a mutual-charging agreement. People who dont pay toll bills within 80 days are exposed to a $40 civil penalty per trip, though WSDOT now offers a second-chance program to help people get those waived. Thats fortunate, because drivers and the toll division are bound to make mistakes in the early going. ]", "Date": "20150919", "Title": "[Q&A: a guide to using I-405s new express toll lanes]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/qa-a-guide-to-using-i-405s-new-express-toll-lanes/", "Author": "[Mike Lindblom]"}
