{"Content": "[ A report by Congress nonpartisan budget analysts seems to have thrown Democrats onto the defensive after it concluded that the partys drive to boost the federal minimum wage could cost a half-million jobs by 2016. A Congressional Budget Office report released Tuesday concluded that a gradual increase to $10.10 hourly by that year  which is what President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats are seeking  would increase pay for more than 16.5 million people, mostly those earning low wages. It also would lift 900,000 people over the federal poverty threshold, the study said. Democrats hailed those findings. But in a congressional election year in which the slow-recovering economy remains a paramount issue, Democrats from the White House to Capitol Hill contested another of the reports conclusions: that the increase would reduce jobs in 2016 by roughly 500,000, or 0.3 percent. That figure was the midpoint of a range of job losses the budget office estimated at somewhere from negligible to 1 million eliminated positions. And it was an unpleasant number for Democrats, who plan to make their long-shot effort to raise the minimum wage this campaign year a centerpiece of their focus on correcting income inequity between haves and have-nots. Jason Furman, chairman of the White Houses Council of Economic Advisers, and council member Betsey Stevenson referred in a blog post to a statement by more than 600 economists who cited recent academic findings that increases in the minimum wage have had little or no negative effect on the employment of minimum-wage workers, even during times of weakness in the labor market. Theres some respectful disagreement on the emphasis and certainty around that magnitude of employment loss, Furman told reporters of the CBO estimates. He added, Zero is a perfectly reasonable estimate of the impact of the minimum wage on employment based on research by other economists. Among those echoing Furman were Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, author of the minimum wage bill the Senate plans to debate next month. His measure would boost todays $7.25 standard in three steps to $10.10 by 2016, with annual increases reflecting inflation after that. Citing the newest economic research using the most sophisticated methodologies, Harkin said, since the first minimum wage was enacted more than 75 years ago, opponents have argued that a wage floor would cause job loss. But this is a myth. Republicans, who long have solidly opposed a minimum wage boost as a job killer, wasted no time in using the budget office report to buttress their case. Todays CBO report shows that raising the minimum wage could destroy as many as 1 million jobs, a devastating blow to the very people that need help most in this economy, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. said. With unemployment Americans top concern, our focus should be creating  not destroying  jobs for those who need them most, said Brendan Buck, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. The study also examined the impact of boosting the minimum wage to just $9 hourly by 2016, similar to what Obama embraced a year ago, and leaving it at that level afterward. That lesser increase would have smaller effects  about 100,000 fewer jobs, higher wages for 7.6 million workers and 300,000 people lifted out of poverty. Without any changes in the minimum wage, about 45 million Americans are expected to live below the poverty line in 2016. The budget office estimates that the poverty level that year would be $24,100 for a family of four, less for smaller families. The report said an increase to $10.10 would add $31 billion to the earnings of low-wage workers. But it noted that only 19 percent of that increase would go to families earning less than the poverty threshold, while 29 percent would go to families earning more than triple the poverty level. That is because many low-wage earners are not in low-wage families. In addition, income would decrease by $17 billion for families earning at least six times the poverty level because that group would be affected most by lost business income and price increases. The report said that besides boosting wages for people earning less than $10.10 hourly, a minimum wage boost to $10.10 would help some people making more than that amount as bosses adjust their pay scales upward. A minimum wage boost can cost jobs because employers can compensate for their higher wage costs by raising prices. That can prompt consumers to purchase fewer goods and services and, in turn, encourage companies to hire fewer workers, the report said. A minimum wage increase also encourages some businesses to trim the number of low-paid workers. But the study said the effect can be mixed. It noted that some companies would react by getting higher productivity from their workers, and some would see savings because increased wages could reduce turnover. Other companies could benefit as increased overall spending on goods and services by low-wage workers boosts demand for their products. Some workers incomes would grow as their earnings increase, causing them to pay more taxes. But for others, income would fall  reducing their tax burden  and still others would begin collecting unemployment insurance. As a result, the budget office said a higher minimum wage would have a negligible impact on federal budget deficits.

{"Content": "[ A rift over national security is developing in the early stages of the Republican Partys next presidential campaign, pitting libertarians who question government overreach against defenders of a more hawkish approach on national security formed after the 2001 terrorist attacks. During a forum Thursday night in Aspen, Colo. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie pointed to a strain of libertarianism coursing through both parties as a very dangerous thought more than a decade after the Sept. 11 attacks. Christie was asked whether he was referring to Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a potential presidential candidate who has been at the forefront of the partys libertarian wing. You can name any number of people and hes one of them, said Christie, noting his state suffered the second-most casualties in the hijacked airliner attacks on New York and Washington, which killed nearly 3,000 people. These esoteric, intellectual debates  I want them to come to New Jersey and sit across from the widows and the orphans and have that conversation. And they wont, because thats a much tougher conversation to have. Paul responded Friday on Twitter, saying Christie worries about the dangers of freedom. I worry about the danger of losing that freedom. Spying without warrants is unconstitutional. For Republicans, the national security debate offers a window into an evolving party that nearly a decade ago re-elected President George W. Bush, in part, on the basis of his administrations hard-line response to the terror attacks and use of tools provided by the USA Patriot Act, which gave the administration the powers to search records and conduct roving wiretaps in pursuit of terrorists. It also serves notice that whoever hopes to claim the GOP nomination in 2016 may need to fuse factions within the party on national security. The exchange followed a fight this week in Congress over the National Security Agencys collection of hundreds of millions of U.S. phone records, where libertarian-leaning conservatives and liberal Democrats sought to undo the NSA program that they contend is an affront to civil liberties. The House narrowly defeated the attempt to restrict the surveillance, with some Republicans questioning whether their adversaries had forgotten the lessons of 2001. The House vote came in the weeks after former NSA systems analyst Edward Snowden leaked classified documents that exposed the governments secret surveillance activities. And it followed Pauls nearly 13-hour filibuster in March over President Barack Obamas pick to lead the CIA, a fight that focused attention on the presidents use of aerial drones to kill suspected terrorists and concerns the unmanned aircraft could be used in the United States to target suspects who are American citizens. Doug Stafford, a top adviser to Paul, said in a statement that if Christie believes the constitutional rights and the privacy of all Americans is `esoteric, he either needs a new dictionary, or he needs to talk to more Americans, because a great number of them are concerned about the dramatic overreach of our government in recent years. Republicans have said the libertarian strain within their party has been galvanized by what they call a large, more intrusive government under Obama, pointing to the health care overhaul, probes by the IRS into political groups and the Snowden affair. Yet the internal debate in the months after Obamas re-election underscores a party figuring out a new approach to foreign policy as long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan come to a close and many Americans express hesitation about future foreign entanglements. Republican consultants based in early presidential voting states said there is an undeniable growing wave of libertarianism within the GOP that has already begun to reshape the political debate as candidates begin to jockey for position three years before the next presidential contest. South Carolina-based Republican operative Hogan Gidley said there are risks  both for candidates like Christie who criticize the libertarian movement and for candidates like Paul who embrace it. You cant ignore the libertarian movement. And if you do, you do it at your own peril, said Gidley, a senior aide on Rick Santorums 2012 presidential campaign. But he said some libertarian policies  particularly those that would aggressively scale back spending on defense and foreign policy  could scare away voters, as was the case of former presidential candidate Ron Paul, the senators father, who placed fourth in South Carolinas last presidential primary. Yet Rand Pauls libertarian approach remains popular among influential Republican activists. Former New Hampshire GOP chairman Jack Kimball, who is active in the partys `liberty movement, said Christie went overboard on this. Hes got to tone this down. A lot of people in this country are upset with the breadth and scope of what the NSA is doing. Christie, who is running for re-election this year and considered a formidable potential 2016 candidate, made his comments at an event sponsored by the Aspen Institute that also featured Republican governors Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Mike Pence of Indiana, all of whom have been discussed as potential White House aspirants. Asked whether the party had become more libertarian, Jindal said it was a good thing and in part, a reaction to Obamas policies. Youve got a lot of voters  who are saying, `Im tired of the government telling me how to live my life. Walker spoke of the need to make fewer Americans dependent upon government services like unemployment benefits and Medicaid. But Christie, who was appointed by Bush as U.S. attorney in New Jersey one day before the 2001 attacks, warned that the public would not look kindly upon lawmakers who seek to undercut national security efforts if another terror attack struck American soil. The next attack that comes, that kills thousands of Americans as a result, people are going to be looking back on the people who were having this intellectual debate and wondering whether they knew that their first job was to defend the homeland, he said. How Republicans deal with the debate could shape the partys future after losing the popular vote in five of the past six presidential elections. Its a mistake to try to drive anybody out when youre losing, said Sal Russo, chief strategist for the Tea Party Express.

{"Content": "[ A young woman berated Jeb Bush in Reno, Nevada, on Wednesday for his brothers bungled war in Iraq, saying it had spawned the group calling itself the Islamic State. Your brother created ISIS, she declared. Bush said he respectfully disagreed. A middle-aged man pressed Bush to answer whether he would have supported the 2003 Iraqi invasion given the intelligence known today. Bush acknowledged mistakes but sprinkled in praise. I give him credit, he said of his brother, for the 2007 troop surge. By the mornings end, when a wary-sounding Bush told reporters, If I run, it will be 2016, not 2000, it almost came across as wishful thinking. Bush began exploring a presidential run by declaring that he would be his own man. But he is struggling to navigate his relationship with George W. Bush and his legacy. He has fumbled the most basic, predictable questions about the Iraq War  while behind the scenes, he has assured skeptical conservatives that he draws wisdom and important counsel from the former president. The uneasiness stems in part from the two mens awkward relationship, which was never close and was often competitive. But it also reflects Bushs challenge in trying to deal with a fractured electorate in which some conservatives cling to the former president, but he remains a focus of anger across much of the rest of the political spectrum. As he strains to win over Republican activists, particularly in crucial early-voting states like Iowa and South Carolina, Bush is being confronted with a distressing realization: He may now need to lean on his brother to survive the Republican primary, despite the damage that could do to Bush in a general election. In private conversations, Bushs allies have often taken note that his brothers approval ratings among likely primary and caucus voters are sky high. A Quinnipiac University survey this month showed George W. Bushs favorability at 81 percent among likely Republican caucusgoers in Iowa. People familiar with Republican polling in South Carolina say the former presidents numbers are similarly strong among primary voters there. I think in a Republican primary, especially, his brother is a tremendous asset, said Ari Fleischer, who was a White House press secretary during George W. Bushs tenure. In both states, conservative Christians, who were among the most devoted members of George W. Bushs coalition in 2000, are major factors. Jeb Bush, whose positions on immigration reform, education standards and other issues have cost him, could benefit from his brothers reflected glow with evangelicals. At the same time, Bush has sought to inherit his brothers support among neoconservatives. But his difficulty in measuring up to his brother in the eyes of those opinion-makers and donors was much in evidence over the past six weeks: In late March, his allies fielded angry calls from Sheldon Adelson, the casino billionaire who is a staunch supporter of Israel and gave tens of millions of dollars to super PACs in 2012, over a speech given by one of Bushs foreign policy advisers, James A. Baker III. But Adelson gave the former president a lavish reception when he delivered the keynote address in late April to a gathering of the Republican Jewish Coalition, for which Adelson is a major benefactor. Matthew Dowd, a strategist who worked on George W. Bushs 2004 campaign, warned that Bushs strong approval ratings do not translate into voters wanting to see his third term in office. And I think thats the quandary that Jebs now got himself in. Its more incumbent on him to say, Hes my brother, I love my brother, but this is how my presidency would look differently, and show that. Bush seemed to be approaching his brothers foreign policy record delicately from the first: In a major speech in Chicago in February, he articulated a recognizably muscular approach to global affairs but still declared himself my own man. Yet in recent weeks, as he strove to soothe supporters of Israel who questioned his commitment in closed-door meetings, Bush used his brothers record on Israel as evidence of his own reliability  and went on to describe his brother as the person he listens to the most on Mideast issues. It was a surprise to several of those who heard Bush say it  and to a number of people close to George W. Bush who learned of Bushs remarks after the fact. While the former president is said to be in touch with Jeb Bushs campaign from time to time, the two brothers do not speak frequently, according to people close to both men. Yet even as Bush seeks to present a forward-looking vision, he can count on having to answer questions about  if not answer for  his brothers two terms in office. If he is successful in winning the Republican nomination, Bush would probably be pressed on the issue of same-sex marriage  which his brother used as a wedge issue to boost conservative voter turnout in his 2004 re-election campaign. He could also face revived complaints about how his brothers administration responded to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. But first Bush must win over Republicans, whose economic views have grown increasingly populist since George W. Bushs last year in office. Anger over the bank bailouts of 2008 and the former presidents approach to government spending were important ingredients in the rise of the Tea Party movement, which has made the Republican Party vastly less hospitable to candidates seen to represent the partys establishment. But no issue is as fraught for Bush as the Iraq War. During a television interview this week, Bush suggested that he still supported invading Iraq even with hindsight knowledge about intelligence failures. He later said he had misunderstood an interviewers question, but refused to answer it, saying it was a hypothetical. On Wednesday, he said such hypotheticals were insensitive to the families of fallen soldiers in the war. Some of Bushs allies complain that he is in a no-win situation: Just as he will be faulted for embracing his brother, if he distanced himself from the former president he could be called disingenuous. At the town hall in Reno on Wednesday, where one attendee showed up clutching an article, cut out from the local paper, about Bushs latest remarks on the Iraq War, Mitch Brust, 72, and his wife, Pam, said they admired Bushs loyalty to his brother, no matter what private differences they may harbor. If they were not supportive of each other, Id be concerned, Mitch Brust said. That would fly in the face of their family values. Pam Brust, who said she had read George W. Bushs book about his time in office, Decision Points, nodded in agreement. Addressing a sizable crowd in a community centers gymnasium, Bush began by saying, First and foremost, I am proud to be George W.s brother. He added, I cant deny the fact that I love my family.]", "Date": "20150513", "Title": "[College student to Jeb Bush: Your brother created ISIS]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/college-student-to-jeb-bush-your-brother-created-isis/", "Author": "[Maggie Haberman, Michael Barbaro]"}
{"Content": "[ ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP)  President Barack Obama unleashed a blistering and belittling rebuke of Republican White House hopefuls Monday, calling their attack on his landmark nuclear deal with Iran ridiculous if it werent so sad. Standing before television cameras during a trip to Africa, Obama suggested the bellicose rhetoric from some GOP candidates was an attempt to divert attention from Donald Trump, the wealthy businessman-turned presidential contender whose popularity is confounding the Republican field. Maybe it gets attention and maybe this is just an effort to push Mr. Trump out of the headlines, but its not the kind of leadership that is needed for America right now, Obama said during a news conference in Ethiopia. Huckabee criticizes Iran deal as being similar to Holocaust, GOPs Walker hits Obama on Iran, strikes combative tone, New polls: Trump strong in N.H. Iowa, In stunning attack, Cruz accuses leader McConnell of lying, Hispanics love me, Trump declares at Mexican border, Trump on John McCain: I like people who werent captured, , Obamas comments marked his most direct engagement in the race to succeed him. Until now, hes largely limited his commentary to policy differences with Republicans, often sidestepping the names of specific candidates. But the presidents unsparing criticism Monday  targeting candidates Mike Huckabee and Ted Cruz, as well as Trump  underscored his sensitivity to efforts to scuttle the Iran accord, which he hopes will be his signature foreign policy initiative. It also raised the prospect of an aggressive role for Obama in the 2016 presidential campaign. In 18 months, Im turning over the keys, Obama said. I want to make sure Im turning over the keys to somebody who is serious about the serious problems that the country faces and the world faces. The president was asked specifically about Huckabees assertion that Obama had agreed to a nuclear deal that would take the Israelis and basically march them to the door of the oven, a reference to crematoria in Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust. The Israeli government staunchly opposes the agreement and views an Iranian nuclear program as a threat to its existence. Obama said the comments from Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, were part of a broader pattern from Republicans. He also singled out Cruz, the Texas senator, for saying the nuclear deal makes Obama  not Iran  the leading state sponsor of terrorism. These are leaders in the Republican Party, Obama said, seeming incredulous. He suggested the GOP was breaking longstanding American tradition of not playing fast and loose with facts during serious foreign policy debates. Cruz, appearing Monday night on Fox News Channels Hannity, responded, It speaks volume that hes halfway across the globe and he feels the need to attack me. Hillary Rodham Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, said she was offended personally by Huckabees comments. His remarks should be repudiated by every person of good faith, she said during a campaign stop in Iowa Monday. Huckabee dismissed the criticism, arguing that what was ridiculous and sad was that Obama wasnt taking Irans threats to destroy Israel seriously. I will stand with our ally Israel to prevent the terrorists in Tehran from achieving their own stated goal of another Holocaust, Huckabee said in a statement. While Huckabees comments were aimed at Obama, some members of the GOP field  Trump most notably  havent held back in their criticism of each other as next weeks initial Republican debate draws near. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush called on his colleagues Tuesday to tone it down. We have to campaign with joy in our hearts  not anger, Bush said during an event outside Orlando. We shouldnt say outrageous things that turn people off to the conservative message. Our message is the one of hope and opportunity for everyone. The White House is the midst of an intense lobbying campaign to prevent Congress from blocking implementation of the Iran deal. Lawmakers have until mid-September to review the accord, which aims to curb Irans nuclear program in exchange for relief from international economic sanctions. The Republican candidates are united in their opposition to the deal, saying Obama has left Iran on the brink of building a bomb and done nothing to address Tehrans support for terrorism. Some, including Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, have vowed to immediately scrap the agreement if elected. Obamas unprompted analysis of Trumps effect on the Republican field marks a shift for the president. Hes largely steered clear of opportunities to weigh in on controversial statements Trump has made in recent weeks about Mexican immigrants and the war record of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. who was taken prisoner in Vietnam. Obama brought up on his own Trumps suggestion that McCain wasnt a war hero because he was captured. Praising McCains heroism, the president said Trumps remarks grew out of a political culture where those types of comments are tolerated. When outrageous statements are made about me, a lot of people outraged about McCain were pretty quiet, he said. Obama has a long history with Trump, who was a driver of the birther movement that claimed the president wasnt born in the U.S. Trumps claims pushed Obama to release a copy of his birth certificate in 2011. Asked on Foxs Hannity to respond to Obama, Trump called the president very divisive and said he should have devoted more time to working on a good nuclear deal with Iran instead of what hes doing. For years, Trump has been a sought-after surrogate and fundraiser for GOP candidates. As a candidate himself, hes unexpectedly emerged this summer as a leading contender for the GOP nomination, tapping into voters discontent with Washington. While some GOP candidates stepped up their criticism of Trump after his comments on McCain  South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham called him a jackass  the businessmans standing with voters does not appear to have been significantly damaged. He is still expected to be among the 10 candidates who qualify for the first Republican debate on Aug. 6 based on their standing in national polls.

{"Content": "[ African-Americans and Latinos are losing economic ground when compared with whites in the areas of employment and income as the United States pulls itself out of the Great Recession, the latest State of Black America report from the National Urban League says. The annual report, called One Nation Underemployed: Jobs Rebuild America, noted that the underemployment rate for African-American workers was 20.5 percent, compared with 18.4 percent for Hispanic workers and 11.8 percent for white workers. Underemployment is defined as those who are jobless or working part-time jobs but desiring full-time work. The report also said African-Americans are twice as likely as whites to be unemployed. The unemployment rate for blacks was 12 percent in February, compared with 5.8 percent for whites. Many Americans are being left behind, and that includes African-Americans and Latinos who are being disproportionately left behind by the job creation that we see, National Urban League President Marc Morial said. Despite the dismal numbers, an analysis by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found African-Americans significantly more optimistic about their future standard of living than whites, regardless of income level, education or partisanship. Overall, 71 percent of blacks surveyed in the 2012 General Social Survey agreed that they have a good chance of improving their standard of living, outpacing the share among whites by 25 percentage points. The survey found high optimism even among blacks who say racism is a cause for economic inequality. Such findings illustrate a level of optimism in the African-American community and its important to lift that up, said La June Montgomery Tabron, president and CEO of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, which released similar findings this week in separate research. The National Urban League is pushing for several economic measures, including an increase in the minimum wage, an issue being debated in Congress.  Democrats backed by President Barack Obama want to force election-year votes on gradually increasing todays minimum to $10.10 by 2016, an effort that seems likely to fail in Congress. Republicans generally oppose the proposal, saying it would cost too many jobs. More must be done in post-recession America to try to help people and help communities close these gaps, Morial said. The National Urban League derives its numbers from an equality index that is based on nationally collected data from federal agencies including the Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the National Center for Education Statistics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With full equality with whites in economics, health, education, social justice and civic engagement set at 100 percent, the National Urban League said this years equality index for blacks stands at 71.2 percent, a slight improvement over last years index of 71.0 percent. However, the economic portion of the index dropped from 56.3 percent to 55.5 percent. The equality index for Hispanics improved to 75.8 percent, compared with 74.6 percent last year, while the Hispanic economics index declined from 60.8 percent to 60.6 percent. The report for the first time ranked large American cities from most equal to least equal when it comes to income equality and unemployment equality. Memphis, Tenn. ranked the most equal for Hispanics when it came to unemployment equality, because in that city the Latino unemployment rate was only 3.8 percent, compared with a 6.5 percent unemployment rate for whites. For blacks, the Augusta-Richmond County, Ga. metropolitan area was most equal, with a 13.3 percent unemployment rate for blacks and an 8.5 percent unemployment rate for whites. When it came to income, the most equal city for blacks was Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, Calif. where the median black household income was $44,572, while the median white household brought in $57,252. For Hispanics, Lakeland-Winter Haven, Fla. was most equal, with median Hispanic income of $39,434 and median white income of $44,014.

{"Content": "[ After claiming victory in SeaTac, backers of a $15-an-hour minimum wage are turning their attention to Seattle. Labor activists who backed the measure that raises wages for airport-related workers in SeaTac said Wednesday that the push is on to raise Seattles wage floor to $15 for all workers. There is going to be a debate about a $15 minimum wage in Seattle, and it will be led by our new mayor, said David Rolf, president of the Service Employees International Unions (SEIU) Seattle-based Healthcare 775 NW local., There are citizens who are perfectly ready to move an initiative to ballot next year if an agreement cant be reached at City Hall between labor and business, he said. But Im hopeful that we can engage in a reasonable dialogue about how to get to $15. SeaTac Proposition 1 creates an hourly minimum wage of $15 for hospitality and transportation workers in and around the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. With 3,942 votes counted as of Wednesday, Proposition 1 led 53 percent to 47 percent  a difference of 236 votes out of a total of 12,100   registered voters citywide. Proposition 1 supporters said they registered nearly 1,000 new SeaTac voters in the run-up to the election, and new voters tend to cast last-minute ballots. Washingtons mail-in voting system means ballots could be postmarked as late as Tuesday, so vote counting will continue through Friday. The measures opponents said they remain cautiously optimistic., There still are so many more votes to be counted, said Scott Ostrander, general manager of Cedarbrook Lodge in SeaTac and co-chair of a business-backed political committee opposed to the measure. But Heather Weiner, spokeswoman for Yes! for SeaTac, a union-backed political committee that supports Proposition 1, said, We expect the lead to hold or widen over the next couple of days.  Rolf, who is also an    SEIU vice president, said hes confident Proposition 1 will pass and build momentum for a minimum-wage increase beyond SeaTac and even Seattle. I had an elected official from Lynnwood come up to me Tuesday night and say, You should think about this in Lynnwood, Rolf said. It is a signal from the future. Its telling us that voters and the public are sick of waiting for politicians and CEOs to do the right thing. The push for a $15 minimum wage comes amid widespread concern about income inequality and a lack of jobs that provide middle-class pay and benefits. Seattles mayor-elect, Ed Murray, seized on the issue last summer as fast-food workers nationwide called for a $15-an-hour living wage.  Murray pledged to raise Seattles hourly wage floor to $15, and incumbent Mike McGinn vowed to go even higher if the City Council agreed.  Murray has said he backs a phased-in approach, starting with city workers and then extending it to employees of national fast-food chains and retailers. Wednesday, Murray told reporters hell bring both business and labor to the bargaining table. I think there is interest from both sides to do this collaboratively  dare I use the word  versus ending up with a ballot measure, Murray said. Although he did not offer a precise timeline, Murray said he would work on the issue   early in his administration and hoped to have a $15 minimum wage by the end of his first term, with protections for small businesses and others. Maud Daudon, president and CEO of Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, said shes encouraged that Murray wants a robust discussion. The chamber opposed SeaTac Proposition 1, but has not yet declared its position on a $15 minimum wage in Seattle, Daudon said. Our fervent hope is that we can bring the problem-solving, solutions-based approach of business to this issue, she said. Supporters of a minimum-wage increase say it would lift low-wage workers out of poverty and strengthen the economy. Opponents say it would force businesses to cut staff and raise prices. The idea of giving low-wage workers a pay raise is gaining momentum. Also Tuesday, voters in New Jersey overwhelmingly approved a measure to raise the states minimum wage by a dollar to $8.25 an hour and to peg it to inflation. That makes New Jersey the 11th state, including Washington, to require annual inflation adjustments. Nationally, the federal minimum wage has been at $7.25 an hour since 2009. On Jan. 1, Washingtons minimum wage will increase by 13 cents to $9.32, the highest of any state. Congressional Democrats are calling for a hike in the federal minimum wage to $10.10. But with Congress in gridlock, local policymakers are taking matters into their own hands, said Paul Sonn, of the National Employment Law Project. Were going to see more cities call for higher minimum wages, Sonn said. More and more college graduates are working in jobs like retail or restaurants. These jobs are becoming a bigger part of our economy, and cities and states are struggling with that. Four major California airports already require their tenants to pay minimum wages well above the statewide standard. At Los Angeles International Airport, workers are guaranteed an hourly minimum of $10.91, or $15.67 without health benefits., California lawmakers in September committed to boost the states hourly minimum standard from $8 to $10 by 2016. In Albuquerque, N.M. and San Jose, Calif. voters last November raised local wage floors. And in New York City, Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio, who tapped voter frustration with rising income inequality, supports a separate minimum wage above the statewide rate. If you pay workers a living wage, thats good for everybody, said Seattle venture capitalist Nick Hanauer, who along with his wife, Leslie, gave $25,000 to support Proposition 1. Its good for businesses. Its good for the workers. And its good for taxpayers because now they dont have to pick up the tab for government-funded poverty programs. Hanauer said the SeaTac measure will have ramifications nationwide. President Obama, in his State of the Union speech, called for a $9-an-hour minimum wage, Hanauer said.

{"Content": "[ After listening to Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin as he has traveled the country preparing his campaign for president, which officially begins Monday, admiring voters most often describe him as authentic, real and approachable, Walkers advisers say. Two words these voters do not use about him? Smart and sophisticated. Scott is working on that, said Ed Goeas, a veteran Republican pollster and a senior adviser to Walker. Look, approachable is worth its weight in gold in politics. Smart is something voters look for in legislators who craft policy. But Scott is preparing hard to talk about every issue. As Walker becomes the 15th prominent Republican to enter the 2016 race, the crucial question he must answer is whether he can cross the threshold of credibility so that someone entering a voting booth can imagine him as president, according to several leading Republicans and interviews with regular voters. While Walker is ahead in some opinion polls, including for Iowas first-in-the-nation caucuses, a series of early gaffes alarmed party leaders and donors and led Walker to begin several months of policy tutorials.  The collective hope is that Walker can avoid what Goeas and others describe as Sarah Palins problem: becoming a candidate who is initially popular among Republicans, like the 2008 vice-presidential nominee, but loses luster because of missteps as the campaign goes on. Walker is now emerging from his crash course with the aim of reassuring activists and contributors, who have given relatively modest amounts to his political operation so far. The goal is to no longer sow doubts with comments like comparing pro-union protesters to Islamic State group terrorists, refusing to answer a question about evolution, or saying he does not know if President Obama is a Christian or if he loves America. Whether Walker can demonstrate that he has a command of the challenges facing America, and is big enough for the presidency, will be tested in the coming weeks on the campaign trail and in televised debates. Gov. Terry Branstad, Republican of Iowa, said Walker had a lot going for him given that hes a neighboring state governor who has been tried and tested on tough issues. Yet Republican voters in Iowa want to be confident Walker will not make political errors that might raise doubts about his capabilities and make Hillary Rodham Clinton look more prepared if she emerges as the Democratic nominee. Iowa is a state that rewards candidates who work hard, Branstad said, and I think Governor Walker will benefit if he shows he has done the work to be ready to lead. Judd Gregg, a former three-term senator from New Hampshire, noted that Walker had a good run of events there in the spring, followed by long absences as he focused more on briefings by his advisers. Many Republicans are not sure what to expect from him as he returns Thursday as part of his campaign kickoff tour. If Walker comes across as very credible, he has the political record and the message to do very well in the New Hampshire primary, Gregg said. But again, he has to be credible. Concerns about the breadth and depth of Walkers knowledge extend to both national-security and domestic-policy issues. Two Republicans recalled being at a closed-door event last winter when, they said, Walker did not articulate a strong answer to a question about Internet neutrality, instead promising to look at the issue. Others questioned his sophistication in boiling down national-security challenges to matters of safety; he believes people relate to that word, whereas national security is an elitist phrase. And his repeated comments that the most important foreign-policy decision of his lifetime was President Reagans firing of air traffic controllers in 1981, because it got the attention of the Soviet Union, was a sign to some Republicans that Walker, who dropped out of Marquette University and has not traveled widely abroad, has a limited worldview. His lack of knowledge in the foreign-policy area has been a problem because, well, you want your commander in chief to be confident on those issues, said Bruce Perlo, chairman of the Grafton County Republican Committee in New Hampshire. Recognizing the problem, Walker has joined in hourslong meetings in Washington; Madison, Wis.; and elsewhere for tutorials on the Islamic State, Iran, Russia and military and geopolitical confrontations, as well as human-rights abuses, border security and immigration policy, and other issues, advisers said. He has relied on Republicans such as former Sen. Jim Talent of Missouri, who leads Walkers national-security advisory council, and Andrew Bremberg, his policy director, who previously was a top aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. In recent months, Walker has also met or spoken with Prime Ministers Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel (as part of a trip to Israel), David Cameron of Britain and Stephen Harper of Canada; Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Toomas Hendrik Ilves of Estonia; retired military leaders such as former Gen. David Petraeus and former Gen. Jack Keane; and a number of U.S. and foreign ambassadors. Aides to Walker provided this list in response to questions about his briefings; they declined a request to interview Walker. Keane, in an email, said he had provided an analysis of global security challenges facing the United States, which he has done for several other candidates from both parties. He said he was not an adviser to any campaign, and he declined to offer an assessment of Walkers capabilities. Pete Peters, a Republican voter in New Hampshire and a Navy veteran, said that the rise of the Islamic State group was his foremost concern in the 2016 election, and that he was far from certain that Walker had the ability to defeat the terrorists. I like Walker, but he doesnt come across like a guy who has thought hard or creatively about the Middle East, Peters said. Walker does seem to have made some progress. One of the Republicans who was concerned about net neutrality said that, about a month ago, he heard Walker give a thoughtful and crisp statement about the issue. A lot of us are still worried about Walkers off-the-cuff answers, and about how Walker will handle himself when the real shooting starts in Iowa, when the television attack ads and direct-mail pieces start hitting him, said the Republican, who leads a prominent national conservative group and is not aligned with any presidential candidate. He spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly assess Walker, with whom he has a good relationship. The policy briefings have cut into time that Walker might have otherwise devoted to fundraising events, which his advisers cite as one reason for the relatively modest amount that he and his allies have raised for his political committees in recent months. The dollar amount is expected to be disclosed soon. But some potential donors have said in recent weeks that Walkers busy schedule was not an issue for them; rather, they were taking a wait-and-see approach on Walker.]", "Date": "20150712", "Title": "[Authentic Scott Walker seeks to add smart to image]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/authentic-scott-walker-seeks-to-add-smart-to-image/", "Author": "[Patrick Healy]"}
{"Content": "[ After U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida insisted at the Republican presidential debate that rape and incest victims should carry pregnancies to term, aides to Hillary Rodham Clinton rushed to say that his unyielding stance would hurt Rubio with female voters. When Donald Trump chose Friday to stand by his slights against women during the debate, saying Fox News journalist Megyn Kelly behaved very badly as a moderator  and then promoting a Twitter message calling her a bimbo  the chairwoman of the New Hampshire Republican Party accused Trump of chauvinism. And in response to multiple male candidates saying they would shut down the federal government over financing for Planned Parenthood, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) emailed talking points to allies, saying that among the losers at the debate were American women, who were attacked at every turn. Republican Party leaders, whose presidential nominees have not won a majority of female voters since 1988, are setting their sights on making electoral gains among women in the 2016 presidential race and trying to close the gender gap in swing states such as Florida and Colorado. But the remarks and tone about women at Thursdays debate  and the sight of 10 male candidates owning the main stage debate  may have damaged the partys standing among female voters in the 2016 general election, according to pollsters and some Republican leaders. So much of the debate was all about appealing to male voters and other parts of the Republican base, rather than doing anything to help the partys general-election goal of trying to be more inclusive, said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. In the short term, the political peril for the Republican candidates may not be so grave. They are largely focused now on winning over likely Republican voters who will decide the partys nomination, an electorate that tends to skew male and older in many key states. Recent polls of Republican voters indicate Trump is performing strongly among men and to a slightly lesser extent among women, though sizable numbers of women also say they would not support him. It remains an open question whether Trump offended his supporters, or many other likely primary voters, by refusing to renounce his past descriptions of women as fat pigs during the debate; indeed, pollsters say he may have struck a chord with some voters by saying he doesnt have time for political correctness when he was asked about his remarks. With the possibility that a woman could be the nominee of a major political party for the first time, Republicans are facing the likelihood of an even more complicated environment than they have had in recent presidential elections. Gallup polls show that female voters have been favoring the Democratic presidential nominees since the 1990s, often by increasingly large numbers. Several prominent Republican women said they were worried the candidates would only hurt themselves, and the party, if they did not change the substance and style of their remarks at future debates, which will be held monthly this fall and winter. Thursdays debate attracted an enormous audience of 24 million viewers; the next debate will be Sept.16, broadcast on CNN. Not one candidate attempted to persuade women voters, said Margaret Hoover, a Republican consultant and author. The GOP needs to fight for women votes because it believes our policies are better for women. On abortion, Rubio, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker gave no ground, unlike the remarks by some Republicans on other social issues such as same-sex marriage. Carly Fiorina, the only female Republican in the presidential race, who was relegated to an earlier debate Thursday because of her low poll numbers, was circumspect about whether she would have challenged Trump had she been onstage with him. When asked if she would have denounced his comments, she insisted that she had, but then proceeded to do so only in generic, gender-agnostic terms about civility in politics. As for Trump, as he made the rounds to the morning talk shows, he seemed to show some signs of, if not quite contrition, at least regret that people could be left with the impression that he said something offensive to women. I dont recognize those words, he said on the MSNBC program Morning Joe. Not that Im an angel, by the way. But I dont recognize those words. Any regret was fleeting. He also insisted his fat pigs disparagement of Rosie ODonnell was the biggest event in terms of sound, and in terms of combustion in the room. It was the biggest event of the evening.]", "Date": "20150807", "Title": "[Treatment of women a topic after GOP presidential debate]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/treatment-of-women-a-topic-after-gop-presidential-debate/", "Author": "[Patrick Healy, JEREMY W.

{"Content": "[ Along with celebrating food, music and culture during National Hispanic Heritage Month, a new tradition should take hold this year: registering to vote. In the past few months, the rise of Donald Trump as offender-in-chief infuriated many in the Latino community. Soon after Trump made disparaging remarks about Mexican immigrants while declaring his bid for the U.S. presidency, actress America Ferrera personally thanked Trump in a piece on the Huffington Posts website for sparking more political participation. There are a whole lot of Americans who are Latino and have the right to vote. And, were not going anywhere, Ferrera wrote. Your negativity and your poorly thought out speech ignited a fire in our community. Thank you, Mr. Trump! , The truth is, Latinos need a not-so-gentle nudge to get voting. According to the Pew Hispanic Center, of the roughly 25 million Latinos eligible to vote, at least 12.2 million are not registered, and only 48 percent of eligible voters turned out for the last presidential election in 2012. Washington ranks 11th among states for the most Latino voters. In 2014, about 300,000 Latinos in Washington were eligible to vote  about 6 percent of all voters. The first step is registering, which groups like Voto Latino have spent years advocating for and facilitating. For this years Hispanic Heritage Month, which runs from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, the organization is sponsoring the Hispanic Heritage Month of Action campaign (hhmaction.com) to get more Latino citizens registered through word-of-mouth in person and online. The fury directed at Trump and other politicians who ignore Latino issues should be funneled into voting  not just in presidential elections, but also state and local elections. Here are some suggestions to increase Latino votes: , After cheering on children to break Trump-shaped piatas, Latinos should pass around voter registration cards at birthday parties or a tablet for online registrations. Instead of just sharing clever memes on social media (Im Cuban and I cant keep calm), you can share some provided by the Hispanic Heritage Month of Action campaign. Next November, after posting all your Dia de los Muertos selfies, remember to post one captioned, I voted. Consider the 2015 election a warm up for 2016. Voting in local elections often influences peoples lives more tangibly than national elections. Hispanic voters in Yakima are already showing more engagement in local politics after the city was mandated by federal court order to establish district elections, according to the Yakima Herald-Republic. In the August primary, more Latino voters cast ballots and five Latino candidates advanced to the general election. When Latinos do turn out to vote, their votes make a difference both locally and nationally, said Jessica Reeves, vice president of partnerships for Voto Latino. Meanwhile, voter apathy remains a problem across America, with some elections being decided by small fractions of the electorate. By the way, National Voter Registration Day is coming up Tuesday. Political observers have referred collectively to Latino voters as a sleeping giant, a problematic comparison suggesting that Hispanics are some sort of silent, passive and massive force that needs to wake up. Hispanics are not asleep culturally or politically. Nor do we vote as a monolithic bloc. Still, Americans who identify as Latino or Hispanic comprise a community, one that wants to advocate for its needs and exert influence like any other demographic. Both Democrats and Republicans recognize they need Latino votes to secure the White House. In 2012, President Obama swept 71 percent of Latino votes while challenger Mitt Romney took 27 percent. Back in 2004, Republican George W. Bush won the presidency with 40 percent of the Latino vote. I agree with Ferrera that Trumps anti-immigrant remarks should serve as a catalyst, not just a source of ire and an endless butt of jokes. The validation will come when millions more Latinos cast ballots every time the polls are open.]", "Date": "20150917", "Title": "[One way for Latinos to shut up Donald Trump: register to vote]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/one-way-for-latinos-to-shut-up-donald-trump-register-to-vote/", "Author": "[NULL]"}
{"Content": "[ Already the polling for the presidential race is feverish, with new findings daily. Which Republican is leading in New Hampshire? How do voters feel, at any evanescent moment, about Hillary Clinton?, But theres a climate in the country thats larger than any contender, strangely resistant to the sorts of ups and downs that a campaign endures and as crucial to the outcome of the election as the clash of personalities that commands the lions share of our attention. Its a mood of overarching uncertainty and profound anxiety. And its so ingrained at this point that we tend to overlook it. For a stunningly long period now, American voters have been pessimistic about the countrys future  and their own. They sense that both at home and abroad, we have lost ground and keep losing more. And the presidency may well be determined not by any candidates fine-tuned calibration on hot-button issues or by cunning electoral arithmetic. It may hinge on eloquence, boldness and a bigger picture. If one of the aspirants can give credible voice to Americans insecurity and trace a believable path out of it, he or she will almost certainly be victorious. In a column a year ago, I noted that for a solid decade, the percentage of Americans who said that the United States was on the wrong track had exceeded the percentage who said that it was on the right track, according to polling by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal. I wondered about a change in the very psychology and identity of a country once famous for its sunniness about tomorrows. Since then the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll has asked the right track/wrong track question another 10 times, and wrong track has continued to prevail without interruption and by substantial margins. The split as of two weeks ago was 62 percent to 28 percent. Other polls have yielded similar findings even as unemployment dropped and the recession faded ever further from view. Some projections validate voters gloom. In The Washington Post recently, Robert Samuelson observed that while the U.S. economy expanded at an average annual rate of 4 percent from 1950 to 1973, its predicted to grow just 2.1 percent annually over the next decade. The 6 percent increases that werent uncommon in the 1990s are apparently long gone. We cant do much about this, Samuelson wrote, citing the retirement of baby boomers and the spread of new technologies that could sideline workers. The latter dynamic is the focus of a new book, Rise of the Robots, thats about as scary as the title suggests. Its not science fiction, but rather a vision (almost) of economic Armageddon. Its author, Martin Ford, invokes robots as a metaphor for the technological innovations, including better software and sophisticated algorithms, that have or will put machines in jobs once held by people. Computers, he notes, can now perform legal, pharmaceutical and medical work. They can produce journalism. In a conversation Tuesday, he told me: If you automate all of these jobs, and technology drives down wages, then consumers have less purchasing power, which can lead to a downward economic spiral. Lead to? Weve known ample spiraling already, and the context for Americans apprehensions is a flourishing debate about whether the American moment is over. The title of a gathering of professors, politicians and writers at the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. later this week asks: Is the United States at a Crossroads? Specific panels will mull related questions: Americas Decline: Myth or Reality? and Is the United States Still the Indispensable Nation?, In The Times last month, Jonathan Weisman interviewed officials involved in the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and noted that concern is rising in many quarters that the United States is retreating from global economic leadership. The economist Edwin Truman, who worked in the Obama administration, told Weisman: Were withdrawing from the central place we held on the international stage. This sense of American drift, of American sputtering, informs President Barack Obamas current push for a sweeping trade agreement and his support for energy exploration, including drilling in the Atlantic and the Arctic. Hes after some economic juice. It will inform the 2016 presidential election, too. Politicians and voters will wrangle in the foreground over taxes, the minimum wage, student debt, immigration. But in the background looms a crisis of confidence that threatens to become the new American way.

{"Content": "[ Americas blacks voted at a higher rate than other minority groups in 2012 and by most measures surpassed the white turnout for the first time, reflecting a deeply polarized presidential election in which blacks strongly supported Barack Obama while many whites stayed home. Had people voted last November at the same rates they did in 2004, when black turnout was below its current historic levels, Republican Mitt Romney would have won narrowly, according to an analysis conducted for The Associated Press. Census data and exit polling show that whites and blacks will remain the two largest racial groups of eligible voters for the next decade. Last years heavy black turnout came despite concerns about the effect of new voter-identification laws on minority voting, outweighed by the desire to re-elect the first black president. William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, analyzed the 2012 elections for the AP using census data on eligible voters and turnout, along with Novembers exit polling. He estimated total votes for Obama and Romney under a scenario where 2012 turnout rates for all racial groups matched those in 2004. Overall, 2012 voter turnout was roughly 58 percent, down from 62 percent in 2008 and 60 percent in 2004. The analysis also used population projections to estimate the shares of eligible voters by race group through 2030. The numbers are supplemented with material from the Pew Research Center and George Mason University associate professor Michael McDonald, a leader in the field of voter turnout who separately reviewed aggregate turnout levels across states, as well as AP interviews with the Census Bureau and other experts. The bureau is scheduled to release data on voter turnout in May. Overall, the findings represent a tipping point for blacks, who for much of Americas history were disenfranchised and then effectively barred from voting until passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965. But the numbers also offer a cautionary note to both Democrats and Republicans after Obama won in November with a historically low percentage of white supporters. While Latinos are now the biggest driver of U.S. population growth, they still trail whites and blacks in turnout and electoral share, because many of the Hispanics in the country are children or noncitizens. In recent weeks, Republican leaders have urged a year-round effort to engage black and other minority voters, describing a grim future if their party does not expand its core support beyond white males. The 2012 data suggest Romney was a particularly weak GOP candidate, unable to motivate white voters let alone attract significant black or Latino support. Obamas personal appeal and the slowly improving economy helped overcome doubts and spur record levels of minority voters in a way that may not be easily replicated for Democrats soon. Romney would have erased Obamas nearly 5 million-vote victory margin and narrowly won the popular vote if voters had turned out as they did in 2004, according to Freys analysis. Then, white turnout was slightly higher and black voting lower. More significantly, the battleground states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Florida and Colorado would have tipped in favor of Romney, handing him the presidency if the outcome of other states remained the same. The 2012 turnout is a milestone for blacks and a huge potential turning point, said Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University who has written extensively on black politicians. What it suggests is that there is an `Obama effect where people were motivated to support Barack Obama. But it also means that black turnout may not always be higher, if future races arent as salient. Whit Ayres, a GOP consultant who is advising GOP Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a possible 2016 presidential contender, says the last election reaffirmed that the Republican Party needs a new message, a new messenger and a new tone. Change within the party need not be lock, stock and barrel, Ayres said, but policy shifts such as GOP support for broad immigration legislation will be important to woo minority voters over the longer term. It remains to be seen how successful Democrats are if you dont have Barack Obama at the top of the ticket, he said. , In Ohio, a battleground state where the share of eligible black voters is more than triple that of other minorities, 27-year-old Lauren Howie of Cleveland didnt start out thrilled with Obama in 2012. She felt he didnt deliver on promises to help students reduce college debt, promote womens rights and address climate change, she said. But she became determined to support Obama as she compared him with Romney. I got the feeling Mitt Romney couldnt care less about me and my fellow African-Americans, said Howie, an administrative assistant at Case Western Reserve Universitys medical school who is paying off college debt. Howie said she saw some Romney comments as insensitive to the needs of the poor. A white Mormon swimming in money with offshore accounts buying up companies and laying off their employees just doesnt quite fit my idea of a president, she said. Bottom line, Romney was not someone I was willing to trust with my future. The numbers show how population growth will translate into changes in who votes over the coming decade:, -The gap between non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black turnout in 2008 was the smallest on record, with voter turnout at 66.1 percent and 65.2 percent, respectively; turnout for Latinos and non-Hispanic Asians trailed at 50 percent and 47 percent. Rough calculations suggest that in 2012, 2 million to 5 million fewer whites voted compared with 2008, even though the pool of eligible white voters had increased. -Unlike other minority groups, the rise in voting for the slow-growing black population is due to higher turnout. While blacks make up 12 percent of the share of eligible voters, they represented 13 percent of total 2012 votes cast, according to exit polling. That was a repeat of 2008, when blacks outperformed their eligible voter share for the first time on record. -White voters also outperformed their eligible vote share, but not at the levels seen in years past. In 2012, whites represented 72 percent of total votes cast, compared to their 71.1 percent eligible vote share. As recently as 2004, whites typically outperformed their eligible vote share by at least 2 percentage points. McDonald notes that in 2012, states with significant black populations did not experience as much of a turnout decline as other states. That would indicate a lower turnout for whites last November since overall voter turnout declined. -Latinos now make up 17 percent of the population but 11 percent of eligible voters, due to a younger median age and lower rates of citizenship and voter registration. Because of lower turnout, they represented just 10 percent of total 2012 votes cast. Despite their fast growth, Latinos arent projected to surpass the share of eligible black voters until 2024, when each group will be roughly 13 percent. By then, 1 in 3 eligible voters will be nonwhite. -In 2026, the total Latino share of voters could jump to as high as 16 percent, if nearly 11 million immigrants here illegally become eligible for U.S. citizenship. Under a proposed bill in the Senate, those immigrants would have a 13-year path to citizenship. The share of eligible white voters could shrink to less than 64 percent in that scenario. An estimated 80 percent of immigrants here illegally, or 8.8 million, are Latino, although not all will meet the additional requirements to become citizens. The 2008 election was the first year when the minority vote was important to electing a U.S. president. By 2024, their vote will be essential to victory, Frey said. Democrats will be looking at a landslide going into 2028 if the new Hispanic voters continue to favor Democrats. , Even with demographics seeming to favor Democrats in the long term, its unclear whether Obamas coalition will hold if blacks or younger voters become less motivated to vote or decide to switch parties. Minority turnout tends to drop in midterm congressional elections, contributing to larger GOP victories as happened in 2010, when House control flipped to Republicans. The economy and policy matter. Exit polling shows that even with Obamas re-election, voter support for a government that does more to solve problems declined from 51 percent in 2008 to 43 percent last year, bolstering the view among Republicans that their core principles of reducing government are sound. The partys Growth and Opportunity Project report released last month by national leaders suggests that Latinos and Asians could become more receptive to GOP policies once comprehensive immigration legislation is passed. Whether the economy continues its slow recovery also will shape voter opinion, including among blacks, who have the highest rate of unemployment. Since the election, optimism among nonwhites about the direction of the country and the economy has waned, although support for Obama has held steady. In an October AP-GfK poll, 63 percent of nonwhites said the nation was heading in the right direction; thats dropped to 52 percent in a new AP-GfK poll. Among non-Hispanic whites, however, the numbers are about the same as in October, at 28 percent. Democrats in Congress merit far lower approval ratings among nonwhites than does the president, with 49 percent approving of congressional Democrats and 74 percent approving of Obama. William Galston, a former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, says that in previous elections where an enduring majority of voters came to support one party, the president winning re-election  William McKinley in 1900, Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936 and Ronald Reagan in 1984  attracted a larger turnout over his original election and also received a higher vote total and a higher share of the popular vote. None of those occurred for Obama in 2012. Only once in the last 60 years has a political party been successful in holding the presidency more than eight years  Republicans from 1980-1992. This doesnt prove that Obamas presidency wont turn out to be the harbinger of a new political order, Galston says. But it does warrant some analytical caution. Early polling suggests that Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton could come close in 2016 to generating the level of support among nonwhites as Obama did in November, when he won 80 percent of their vote. In a Fox News poll in February, 75 percent of nonwhites said they thought Clinton would make a good president, outpacing the 58 percent who said that about Vice President Joe Biden. Benjamin Todd Jealous, president of the NAACP, predicts closely fought elections in the near term and worries that GOP-controlled state legislatures will step up efforts to pass voter ID and other restrictions to deter blacks and other minorities from voting. In 2012, courts blocked or delayed several of those voter ID laws and African-Americans were able to turn out in large numbers only after a very determined get-out-the-vote effort by the Obama campaign and black groups, he said. Jealous says the 2014 midterm election will be the real bellwether for black turnout. Black turnout set records this year despite record attempts to suppress the black vote, he said. , AP Director of Polling Jennifer Agiesta and News Survey Specialist Dennis Junius contributed to this report.]", "Date": "20130428", "Title": "[In a first, black voter turnout rate passes whites]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/in-a-first-black-voter-turnout-rate-passes-whites/", "Author": "[HOPE YEN]"}
{"Content": "[ AMES, Iowa (AP)  Rick Perry is attacking Donald Trumps credibility and branding the billionaire businessman a cancer on conservatism. Rick Santorum, a conservative stalwart, popped up on a TV program popular with liberals. Lindsey Graham set his cellphone on fire. With the first debate of the Republican presidential campaign approaching, the White House hopefuls are trying everything they can to improve their polling position. A candidate needs to place in the top 10 in an average of national polls to meet the criteria Fox News Channel has set to take the stage Aug. 6 in Cleveland. Those kept out risk being overlooked by voters and financial backers heading into the critical fall stretch before the nominating contests start early in 2016. If youre not on the stage youre irrelevant, you dont matter, said Republican pollster Frank Luntz. Unless you have some serious ad dollars, its not a glass ceiling. Its a concrete ceiling. At of this past week, former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former New York Gov. George Pataki, ex-Pennsylvania Sen. Santorum and South Carolina Sen. Graham were outside the top 10. Others close to the edge including Ohio Gov. John Kasich, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and ex-Texas Gov. Perry. That would relegate them to a second-tier debate, only an hourlong airing before the prime-time event. In your heart of hearts, you want to see me debate Hillary Clinton, Fiorina, the only woman in the Republican contest, said with a grin, drawing applause from more than 100 people at an Ames country club Thursday. I would of course love to be on the debate stage, but were going to keep going with or without it, she told reporters afterward. The boys are going to fight, and Im going to keep doing what Im doing. One guaranteed participant is Trump, despite incendiary comments about Mexican immigrants and Arizona Sen. John McCains war record. Trumps remarks have drawn a backlash in a party trying to expand its Latino voting bloc and where national security is an influential constituency. Boring in on Trump is one approach some rivals hope will help them to break through as the debate nears. Perry unloaded on Wednesday when he called Trumps campaign a barking carnival act and toxic mix of demagoguery, mean-spiritedness and nonsense. Perry pollster Greg Strimple said the goal of the speech was part of a long-standing effort to raise his profile, not to get him in the debate. We had long-planned a speech defending conservatism, Strimple said. When Donald Trump made his negative comments, it provided us the perfect comparison. Perrys supporters are buying national cable ads that could boost his numbers ahead of the debate. On Friday, backers of Christie announced a new ad to air on Fox News. Graham, even further behind in polling, called Trump a jackass after the real estate executive said McCain was not a war hero. McCain served as a Navy pilot during the Vietnam War, who was captured after his plane was shot down and held for more than five years as a prisoner of war. Graham then starred in a video produced by a conservative website demonstrating how to destroy a cellphone after Trump publicly disclosed Grahams number during a campaign appearance in South Carolina. Curt Anderson, a strategist advising Jindals campaign, wrote in Thursdays Wall Street Journal that the Republican Party was sabotaging itself by controlling the debates too much, after concluding that marginal candidates dragged 2012 nominee Mitt Romney too far to the right. They have come out to limit the number of debates we can have, they dictated who can have it, where you have it and who will moderate it, Anderson said in an interview, adding that his complaints were unconnected to Jindals campaign. The only thing left is to dictate what can be said in it. As with Perry, an outside group supporting the Louisiana governor is buying ads on national cable just in time for the debate. Santorum spokesman Matt Benyon said Santorums TV appearances, including on MSNBCs The Rachel Maddow Show, were timed to take advantage of the candidates time in New York this past week, not to boost his poll numbers. Would it be great to be in the debate? Absolutely, Benyon said. But to change your campaign strategy to focus on one date in August is a pretty shortsighted idea. Republican consultant Reed Galen said candidates may have a better chance to introduce themselves to voters in the less-crowded second-tier debate than competing with Trump and the other contenders in the main debate. Still, he understood the drive for prime time. You get more licks in AAA-ball, Galen said.

{"Content": "[ Andrew Cuomo was sworn in for his second term as governor Thursday just hours before his father died. Former three-term Gov. Mario Cuomo did not attend the inauguration because his ill health forced him to stay home. Cuomo said in his inaugural address that he had gone through his speech with his father, who quipped that it was good, especially for a second-termer. He couldnt be here physically today  but my father is in this room, he said. Hes in the heart and mind of every person who is here. His inspiration and his legacy and his spirit is what has brought this day to this point. The governors office said the elder Cuomo died at his home of natural causes due to heart failure. Andrew Cuomo, speaking from the symbolic heights of the newly completed One World Trade Center, used his inauguration to urge New Yorkers to lead by example through some of the nations worst problems. He aimed high with his rhetoric, touching on national issues sure to trigger questions about his political ambitions while also hinting that he may firmly insert himself into the imbroglio that has roiled the nations largest city. We work harder and we earn less. Income inequality is at the highest point in over a century. While American capitalism never guaranteed success, it did guarantee opportunity, Cuomo said. For too many, the dream of economic mobility has been replaced with a nightmare of economic stagnation. Cuomo said these frequently troubled times are a uniquely New York moment because when things are at their worst, New York is at its best. The governor also reacted to the protests against police brutality that have swept the nation since grand juries failed to indict police officers in the deaths of black men, including Eric Garner, whose last moments were captured on videotape as he was placed in a fatal chokehold by a white New York Police Department officer. The world saw an African-American man in Staten Island die and people are confused, disgruntled and angry, Cuomo said.  He argued that today, sadly, too many people are questioning if the blindfold is still intact or does the justice system now see black and white or black and blue or rich and poor. The resulting protests have driven a wedge between Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York City police unions, which have claimed that the mayor has helped create an anti-NYPD atmosphere that led to the fatal shooting of two police officers on Dec. 20. Law enforcement officials have been wrongfully targeted and even assassinated. It must stop, Cuomo said, before calling the two sides to work harder to find common ground. Everyone is talking but no one is listening. De Blasio, whose relationship with Cuomo has at times been rocky, and the head of the largest police union both attended the inauguration but did not speak. The Democratic governor  who has been mentioned as a possible 2016 presidential candidate  took the oath of office in a private ceremony at the governors mansion on Wednesday afternoon, alongside incoming Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul. The 57-year-old Cuomo, who defeated Republican Rob Astorino 54 percent to 40 percent to secure his second term, then to traveled to Buffalo  Hochuls home  for a second inaugural ceremony. He gave a similar speech, with additional focus on New Yorks upstate economy. During his half-hour speech in Manhattan, Cuomo said he wanted to focus his second term on continued efforts to revitalize upstate New York, overhaul public education and make government fairer and more effective. He said the state had made great strides since he took office, turning a $10 billion deficit into a $5 billion surplus, expanding health care to cover 1.5 million more people, approving same-sex marriage, enacting tougher gun control laws and reversing gridlock and dysfunction in state government by getting Republicans and Democrats to work together. He said the state needed to replicate reforms occurring in Buffalo throughout the upstate region and address chronic high poverty with higher wages so you dont have to choose between paying the rent and putting food on the table. On Wednesday, Cuomo is scheduled to deliver his state of the state address to lawmakers, who will begin their 2015 session next week.]", "Date": "20150102", "Title": "[Andrew Cuomo begins 2nd term on day his father dies]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/andrew-cuomo-begins-2nd-term-on-day-his-father-dies/", "Author": "[JONATHAN LEMIRE]"}
{"Content": "[ April is an odd month, some say cruel. But even aside from the weather, strange things are happening. Our job as dutiful citizens is to figure them out. Some are puzzled why former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination, checked the box denoting Hispanic when he applied to vote in 2009. Bush was born in Texas, but his family is from New England and beyond that English royalty. Was he confused because he speaks fluent Spanish and governed a state with a large Hispanic population? Was he already planning to run for president in 2016, an impressive display of foresight knowing hed need Hispanic votes?, No, it was because he is committed to his marriage to Columba, who was born in Mexico. You know how some stereotypical grandparents look exactly alike? White hair and matching running suits, and from behind its hard to tell which one is which? Or, in Best of Show, remember how beloved pets and smitten owners looked identical?, After 41 years of marriage, Jeb and Columba have melded. Mi casa es su casa. Mi heritage es su heritage. We like Jebs insouciance after being apprised of Box Gate: My mistake! Dont think Ive fooled anyone!, Moving on to the Democrats, some are cackling that Hillary Clinton, the front  and only  runner for the Democratic nomination, has hired a charm guru. To what end, you ask. We recall Barack Obama in 2008 saying politely (certainly not snidely), Youre likable enough, Hillary, after the debate moderator asked Clinton if she had enough personal appeal to win over Obama. (Actually, it was a low point in his campaign.), To be on her 2016 communications team, Hillary has hired Kristina Schake, who has been working for Michelle Obama. Reports say Schakes job is to make Hillary  lawyer, former first lady, former senator and former secretary of state  appear softer and more accessible. Schake reportedly told Michelle to shop at Target and taught her mom dancing, which was enormously appealing on The Jimmy Fallon Show. We are promptly reminded of Al Gores Macarena moment, slapping his shoulders and his sides and we have to pause. Lets think through the current dance moves before we get too excited about this. At any rate, we will have to see what Schake comes up with, but since Hillary is on the move to the nomination, we wont have to wait too long. Meanwhile, how about those FBI agents? It turns out that the FBI has not had a physical fitness requirement for 16 years. Who knew? Thousands of us would have applied!, But now they do. In a memo publicized by The New York Times, FBI director James B. Comey told agents: The lives of your colleagues and those you protect may well depend upon your ability to run, fight and shoot, no matter what job you hold. He said agents symbolize to Americans what is right and good and added, I want you to look like the squared-away object of that reverence. I want the American people to be able to take one glance at you and think, THERE is a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. And we thought we could tell an agent when he talked into his wrist. Avid TV viewers deduce this new dictum arrived when the FBI learned last year the CBS show Battle Creek was in preparation. It features a squared-away, straight-arrow, buttoned-down, always prepared, somewhat pompous FBI agent with amazing tech toys. Since the agent is played by well-put-together movie star Josh Duhamel, theres a lot of reverence there already, at least in Hollywood. In the Washington, D.C. Union Station subway stop, there are giant illuminated showcases featuring comic book characters, a reference to dark money and an appeal for the appearance of Mary Jo White, a missing superhero. Tourists pouring into the nations capital for the cherry blossoms are befuddled. The missing MJW is head of the Securities Exchange Commission.

{"Content": "[ ASHLAND, Ky. (AP)  A federal judge has delayed a decision on whether a local official in Kentucky can use her religious beliefs to justify not issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis stopped issuing marriage licenses after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide last month, prompting a flood of both protests and support in this tiny Kentucky county that is home to Morehead State University. The lawsuit is the first of its kind in the country and could serve as a harbinger for dozens of other local officials across the country seeking to test the limits of the Supreme Courts historic ruling. But U.S. District Judge David Bunning suspended the hearing until next Monday at the earliest, because attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union have still not formally notified Davis of the lawsuit against her. The ACLU  arent really concerned in the marriages of their clients. The plaintiffs can get married in at least 117 if not 118 counties in the state of Kentucky if they want to, said Roger Gannam, Davis attorney and the senior litigation counsel for Liberty Counsel, a group that defends religious freedom. This case was about targeting a person of faith to make a point that everyone must comply with the agenda to impose same-sex marriage on all of America. American Civil Liberties Union attorney Dan Cannon said his clients are not targeting anyone; they simply want to get a marriage license in the county where they live and pay taxes. April Miller, who lives in Morehead, said when she heard Davis was refusing to issue marriage licenses because of her religious beliefs, she and her partner of 11 years went to the courthouse to see if it was true. They were denied a license by both Davis and the county judge executive, who said state law only allows him to issue marriage licenses if the clerk is absent. The couple have not tried to get a license from another county. It would be degrading to have to go somewhere else to get our license because of this, Miller said. Another gay couple, David Ermold and David Moore, made news last week when they were denied a marriage license in Rowan County and posted a video of their attempt online that has been viewed more than 1.7 million times on YouTube. The couple filed a separate lawsuit against Davis on Friday, court records show. But Jonathan Christman, an attorney for Davis, said Kentucky law does not require couples to get a marriage license in Rowan County and that other options are available, including going to a neighboring county or asking the judge executive. He argued that the county clerks religious beliefs essentially rendered her absent, thus giving the judge executive authority to issue a license. Meanwhile, forcing Davis to issue the marriage would mean requiring her to sign her name in four different places to bless or approve the marriage, Christman said. When you take office, you dont suddenly shed your constitutional liberties at the door of the courthouse, Christman said. Bunning said that isnt necessarily true. He said that he sees a conflict between the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of religion, and the 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection for everyone under the law. He noted that U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas pointed this out in his dissent to the courts ruling legalizing same-sex marriage. Thomas may very well be a prophet, he said. Bunning questioned attorney Bill Sharp on why the couples wouldnt be satisfied with one of Davis deputies issuing the marriage license or going to a nearby county where the clerk does not have a religious objection. Sharp replied that it would be offensive for couples to accommodate the beliefs of one county clerk. She does not get to impose her religious views on others, he said. Davis, elected last November as a Democrat, took over the office from her mother, Jean Bailey, who served as county clerk for 37 years, according to the Morehead News. Davis worked under her mother as a deputy clerk for 26 years. Her actions, and those of a few other clerks, continue to make same-sex marriage a political issue in Kentucky, which has a high-profile governors election this fall and is home to Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul. Paul said Monday that he is not a legal expert and is not sure if clerks have a legitimate objection based on their religious beliefs.

{"Content": "[ ATHENS, Greece (AP)  Greece faced acute international pressure, notably from President Barack Obama, to secure a deal with creditors fast following days of acrimony that stoked fears of a Greek debt default and exit from the euro. With Greece facing an end-of-month deadline to secure a deal, Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel led calls Monday for a swift resolution to Greeces protracted bailout talks. At the end of a G-7 summit in Elmau, Germany, Obama said there was a sense of urgency to resolve the situation. What its going to require is Greece being serious about making some important reforms, Obama said. The Greeks, he added, will have to make some tough political choices that will be good for the long term. Obama also stressed that the international community should recognize the extraordinary challenges that Greeks face, and if both sides are showing sufficient flexibility, then I think we can get this problem resolved. And German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned time was running out, and that while Greeces euro partners want the country to remain in the eurozone, Athens has to do its part by implementing reforms. Theres not a lot of time, thats the problem, thats why we have to work as intensively as possible, Merkel said. A resolution is needed by June 30, when Greeces bailout program ends and the remaining 7.2 billion euros ($8.1 billion) in rescue loans will no longer be available. Without the funds, Greece cannot repay its debts and could end up crashing out of Europes joint currency. Discussions hit a wall late last week, when Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras rejected as unacceptable a proposal from the three institutions overseeing Greeces bailout  the European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund and European Commission. Worries of a Greek default and euro exit kept markets in check Monday  the Stoxx 50 index of leading European shares closed down 0.8 percent lower and the Athens Stock Exchange ending 2.7 percent lower. Greek government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis said negotiators were in Brussels to explore the scope for convergence with creditors and indicated there was room for negotiation. Sakellaridis reiterated that Greece considers its proposal  a 47-page document delivered by Tsipras during a visit to Brussels last week  to be the basis for a deal. The Greek negotiating team that has gone to Brussels is evidently there so as to see the scope for convergence so there can be a mutually acceptable solution to both sides, Sakellaridis said. The two sides disagree on a number of issues, such as pension cuts and labor reforms. Each side has said it expects a response to its own proposals. Holger Schmieding of Berenberg Bank said the room for manoeuver looks limited, noting that hardliners within Tsipras radical left party and the governments nationalist coalition partner may oppose almost any condition which lenders must attach to the disbursement of money. And on the lenders side, he said the IMF and  to a lesser extent  the ECB seem to be against any further concessions. Jitters over Greece swelled when the government delayed a payment due last Friday to the IMF. Instead, it opted to bundle all four IMF repayments due this month into one on June 30. Allowed under IMF rules, the option has been used only once, by Zambia in the 1980s. Tsipras on Friday described the institutions proposals as an unpleasant surprise, saying they ignored the progress made in the previous months. The rejection sparked the ire of European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, who is considered more lenient towards Greece than the IMF, ECB and the eurozones lead bailout contributor Germany. We will continue to work for a solution, Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said in Brussels. There is a position of the three institutions which is a good basis for finding a solution, provided that all sides concentrate on the remaining issues to be solved. If no deal is secured, one possibility would be for the current bailout to be extended again. Originally due to end late last year, it has already been extended twice. Sakellaridis said this was not something the government was aiming for, and reiterated that Greece wants a comprehensive solution that will also tackle the debt issue. Athens argues its debt, currently at more than 170 percent of annual economic output, is unsustainable and that some form of debt relief is needed. He also sought to douse talk of elections, saying it was not something the government was considering. Some ministers had raised the issue as an option if a deal cannot be reached. The current stalemate comes after five months of difficult negotiations since Tsipras won January elections on promises to end austerity imposed in return for two bailouts worth 240 billion euros. Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, in Berlin to deliver a speech, met with German counterpart Wolfgang Schaeuble for talks that the Greek minister described as productive.

{"Content": "[ ATHENS, Greece (AP)  New Greek proposals aimed at ending a long standoff with international bailout creditors and unlocking vital rescue funds were received with little visible enthusiasm in Brussels on Tuesday. Greece has just three weeks to conclude a deal before its finances implode, and a key negotiator complained that officials at the European Unions executive Commission have yet to respond to the documents presented late Monday. We want a written and clear answer, State Minister Nikos Pappas said, in comment posted on a social media site, as Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras briefed officials in his radical left Syriza party on the negotiations. A government official said the proposals included alternative ideas on budget measures required for creditors to approve the bailout payment, and for a workable plan to render Greeces crushing debt load viable. No further details were made public. The submission follows last weeks impasse, when bailout creditors responded to a 47-page Greek proposal with a brief counter-offer that Athens rejected as containing absurd measures that would worsen the lot of Greeks already reeling from five years of deep cuts and soaring unemployment. The two sides mainly disagree on creditors demands for Athens to raise the sales tax on food, medicine and power bills, labor market reforms and cuts to pensions. These would be hard for the new government to implement less than five months after its election on a combative anti-austerity platform. A deal must be struck before the end of June, when Greeces bailout program ends  and the pending 7.2 billion euro payment ($8 billion) will no longer be available. Without the cash, Greece will be unable to pay its creditors, and would default on its loans. Greece has already said it will bundle its four June debt repayments  all owed to the International Monetary Fund and totaling 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion)  into one on June 30. The move, which is allowed under IMF rules, may be more a sign of defiance than absolute penury. While Greece should still be able to pay pensions and salaries, and keep the essential functions of state running through tax revenues, a default would likely kill its banks. The banks depend on emergency funding from the European Central Bank, but in the case of a government default, the state-backed guarantees they give the ECB as collateral for the emergency funding would become worthless. The import-reliant country could then have to put limits on money transfers and withdrawals and see shortages of basic goods. It could even have to ditch the euro as it adopts a devalued version of its old drachma currency to get liquid currency back into the banks and economy. The price of vital imported goods would likely rocket under the new, weaker currency. A spokesman for the Commission  which together with the ECB and the IMF oversees the rescue program  said diverse proposals are being circulated, but did not comment on what European officials thought of them. The three institutions are currently assessing these suggestions with diligence and care, Margaritis Schinas said in Brussels. Speculation is now growing that the bailout deal could be extended months past its current end-June expiry. Teneo Intelligence analyst Wolfango Piccoli said stretching the bailout to March 2016  when IMF participation in the bailout ends  is slowly emerging as the new baseline scenario ahead of a meeting of eurozone finance ministers on June 18. That would help the creditors delay the question of how to help Greece once the next batch of rescue loans run out. It remains unlikely that (Tsipras) himself will be able to propose the kind of tough deal creditors will find acceptable he said in a note. As a result, Piccoli expects creditors to effectively force a deal, including an extension, on Athens in time for the June 18 meeting, as Greece would have few other options. Schinas said that if the conditions are there Tsipras could hold a new meeting Wednesday with European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker on the sidelines of an EU-Latin America summit in Brussels. At the summit, Tsipras is also expected to meet again with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande. Hopes of progress helped Greek stocks buck the negative trend in Europe, and the main Athens index closed 0.6 percent higher. Greece has depended on international rescue loans since 2010 when it was unable to finance itself by borrowing from financial markets. In exchange for loans, it had to implement big spending cuts and tax hikes. That prescription helped tame the countrys budget deficits but worsened the economy. Failure to agree on a deal with creditors on new reforms has left the country without rescue loans since last summer. Greece has managed to survive through its own resources but cannot do so much longer.

{"Content": "[ AUSTIN, Texas (AP)  Rick Perry has raised so little money for his second-chance presidential bid that hes stopped paying his campaign staffers, the kind of cash crisis that could normally sink a candidate. But the former Texas governor has well-funded super PACs that say theyre ready to step in and keep his message afloat at least through the Feb. 1 caucuses in Iowa, where Perry has spent more time than any other White House hopeful. Its the latest sign of how influential outside groups  armed with small cadres of million-dollar donors  are reshaping presidential politics. Perry raised only about $1 million in his first month of campaigning, a sum that isnt enough to cover his payroll. A pair of pro-Perry outside groups, each with Opportunity and Freedom in its name, amassed almost $17 million over the same period. Those groups, both super political action committees, are barred by federal rules from talking directly to the candidate they support. But it became apparent recently to Austin Barbour, the Republican operative who leads them, how important their role would have to become. The groups began spending money not just on advertisements, but also on employees who can fill roles normally left to the traditional campaign. They hired an Iowa director and deputy director, who now are putting together a super PAC-run ground game in the state that weighs in first in the presidential nominating season. Barbour said hes prepared to hire staff in other early primary states, if necessary. We saw in the campaign finance reports that they didnt raise as much as anyone would have liked, and we knew what that meant  that they were going to have to go lean and mean while we would need to diversify what we were doing to help the governor, Barbour said. Were building Perrys Iowa team. Theres nothing in the playbook that says we cant do that as a super PAC. Even with so much outside help, money problems plaguing Perrys campaign this early could leave future donors  as well as potential primary voters  wondering whether he can survive for the long haul in the crowded a GOP field. Another potential fundraising blow came last week when Perrys low national polling numbers kept him off the prime-time debate stage, which reached 24 million Fox News viewers. Its the deterioration of the campaign, and theres no pretty face, no makeup you can put on it, said Bill Miller, a Texas-based GOP strategist. Its like a NASCAR race. He doesnt have the pole position, and now he doesnt even have a full tank of gas. Yet reports on Tuesday of Perrys money troubles prompted a longtime friend of the former governor to give the super PACs $100,000, Barbour said, declining to name the contributor. Perrys official campaign is continuing as best it can, said Jeff Miller, his campaign manager. All but one staff member has agreed to continue working without pay, and Perry will be in South Carolina later this week before returning to Iowa next week, Miller said. Are we raising as much money as wed like to? No. Are we still going to continue the governors regular visits every week to early states? Yes, Miller said. The Perry campaigns Iowa state chairman, Sam Clovis, said Tuesday he would continue working as a volunteer. I know everything there is to know about running a campaign with very little money, Clovis said. Perrys not alone in relying heavily on super PACs. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former technology executive Carly Fiorina are leaning on outside groups to build their name recognition. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorums ex-campaign manager and two other staff members recently left his financially troubled campaign to form a super PAC supporting him. And former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has a massive super PAC ready to help him with voter outreach. In 2012, the support of a super PAC helped former House Speaker Newt Gingrich win South Carolinas primary and continue competing for the presidency after traditional campaign money dried up. Donors can give $2,700 maximum per election to campaigns, but there are no limits on what they can give to super PACs. Dallas businessmen Kelcy Warren and Darwin Deason gave a total of $11 million to the super PACs backing Perry, even though Warren also serves as the finance chairman for Perrys official campaign. The super PACs would have to wait 120 days to bring aboard anyone currently with the Perry campaign. Barbour said the groups have hired different people, while refusing to say how many are now on the payroll. Opportunity and Freedom has spent more than $2 million so far on pro-Perry ads and will continue to provide such messaging.

{"Content": "[ Ballots were mailed to every Washington voter this year. But most apparently wound up in the recycling with the credit-card and magazine offers. Statewide turnout in the November election was 44.5 percent as of Friday  the lowest in a decade. With several thousand ballots remaining to be counted, that figure could edge up a bit. But it will remain the lowest turnout since 2003, when just 40.5 percent of voters cast ballots, according to Secretary of State Kim Wymans office. Turnout is usually depressed in off-year elections, which dont feature high-profile presidential or congressional contests to attract interest. Since 1980, turnout in off-year elections has averaged 51 percent  which is what elections officials predicted turnout would reach this year. That compares with 79 percent in presidential-election years and 62 percent during midterm elections. Dave Ammons, a spokesman for Wymans office, noted that unlike 2012 there were no highly charged issues like marijuana legalization or gay marriage on this years ballot. Initiative 522, which would have required labeling of genetically engineered foods (GMOs), didnt draw the same level of interest, despite record spending by the no campaign. GMO is a pretty abstract notion that required quite a bit of voter research, and the Eyman one (I-517) only vaguely interested people, Ammons said in an email. The tax advisory votes probably didnt draw anyone to vote and, indeed, we heard from a lot of confused voters who didnt understand the process of a nonbinding vote on something that already happened. The lower turnout was cited by the Yes on I-522 campaign as a factor in the initiatives close defeat. We anticipated a likely lower off-year turnout in all of our strategizing about the race. But this exceeded our expectations and really was in many ways impossible to predict, said Lisa MacLean, a political consultant who worked on the pro-I-522 campaign. Backers vowed to try a similar measure in 2016. I think an even-year electorate is more conducive to turnout among progressives and young voters, MacLean said. Turnout in King County was about 47 percent as of Friday, with thousands more votes waiting to be counted, according to King County Elections. It was higher  about 53 percent  in Seattle, where voters decided a hard-fought mayoral race. Turnout was lowest in Yakima County (37.5 percent) and highest in Jefferson County (64.6 percent). Even with the relatively low numbers, turnout in Seattle, at least, was stellar compared with that in some other major cities. New Yorks mayoral race drew a record-low turnout of 24 percent, The New York Times reported. And in Los Angeles, a mayoral runoff election in May drew a record-low turnout of just 23.3 percent, according to the Los Angeles Times. Jim Brunner: 206-515-5628 or jbrunner@seattletimes.com.

The Thai military, which took power in a coup last year, has threatened her with exile, arrest and physical violence. It shut down her satellite TV show, HotTV, and blocked her YouTube channel. She now posts her videos on Facebook. But without her much larger television audience, she says, the inventory has been collecting dust. It is a constant reminder of her frustration. Other channels just bow to the military, she says. They have a lot to lose  their advertisers might pull out. I really have nothing. I have no husband, no son, no daughter. I have my back against the wall. All I really have is my heart. Since the military toppled a democratically elected government on May 22, 2014, ending months of street protests, experts say that Thailand  once widely considered a beacon of liberal democracy in Southeast Asia  has been sliding toward dictatorship, replete with tightened restrictions on freedom of expression, assembly and the press. The government  called the National Council for Peace and Order  has criminalized protests involving more than five people and threatened to shut down dissenting media.  Although Bangkok has remained largely calm in recent months, a bomb exploded Monday night at the Erawan Shrine, a popular tourist attraction in the central city, killing at least 18 people and injuring more than 100. The explosion occurred near the Rajprasong intersection, the site of the protests last year that compelled the junta to take power. No one immediately claimed responsibility. We are not sure if it is politically motivated, but they aim to harm our economy and we will hunt them down, Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwon told reporters, according to The Associated Press. The prime minister, former army chief Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha, has burnished a reputation as an eccentric strongman. In September, Prayut told an audience that he once covered himself from head to toe in holy water to ward off curses from opponents. In December, he threw a banana peel at a cameraman. He has demanded that journalists kneel before him. In March, when asked what hed do with reporters who didnt tell the truth, he joked, Well probably just execute them. Under Prayut, 61, the junta has detained activists for the slightest acts of dissent, including raising three-fingered Hunger Games salutes, reading out loud from the anti-authoritarian novel 1984, and in the case of one lunchtime gathering, eating sandwiches with political intent. The country is so desperate, said Sunai Phasuk, a Bangkok-based senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. He said that Prayuts restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly have muted most moderate criticism, creating an environment where only the most radical voices remain. Hes mercurial  he himself is a ranter, Sunai said. He wants Thailand to be rebuilt in his image.  You can end up in jail for disagreeing with him. In April, Prayut replaced martial law with a sweeping security decree granting the junta extralegal power to crack down on acts deemed harmful to national peace and stability. Local media have called the rule, Article 44 of an interim constitution, the dictator law. Chuwit Kamolvisit, a Bangkok politician and former massage-parlor tycoon known for disclosing endemic bribery within the citys police department, said that the junta has repeatedly warned him not to criticize Prayut in interviews with local journalists. We cannot argue against someone who controls both the law and the gun, he said. Prayut has repeatedly said that he has no intention of clinging to power. Yet critics say he has taken steps to solidify his rule, such as prosecuting political opponents and appointing a military-heavy Cabinet and parliament, which declared him prime minister a year ago. He has repeatedly delayed general elections, most recently to 2016. All of this is playing out against the backdrop of extraordinarily sensitive royal succession: The countrys widely revered 87-year-old King Bhumibhol Adulyadej is reportedly ill. Prayut is known as a staunch monarchist, analysts say, and may not step down until the succession issues are resolved. Thailand has experienced 12 coups  and seven attempted coups  since it became a constitutional democracy in 1932. The country has been deeply divided for years, primarily along economic lines, and despite a facade of normality in the capital, tension simmers. Society has become so divided, said Nuttakarn Sumon, 37, the director of a modeling agency in Bangkok. If youre upper middle class, and youre not a farmer or a taxi driver, part of you might feel really against the governments detractors, she said. Some of them prefer the dictatorship; they think its better than having protests. This dictatorship is going to stick around for longer than most people think, said Aim Sinpeng, an expert on Thai politics. She said that Prayuts initiatives have a broad cultural bent. He has pushed to install 12 core values of the Thai people in the primary-school curricula, including love for the nation, respect for the law and elders, and concern for the public good over self-interest. The junta has issued orders requiring that schoolchildren recite them in class. The regime feels that part of the problem why Thailand is in such a mess  why its had protests for the past 10 years  is that weve forgotten what its like to be Thais, Aim said. ]", "Date": "20150817", "Title": "[Bangkok bomb blast comes amid dictatorship fears]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/bangkok-bomb-blast-comes-amid-dictatorship-fears/", "Author": "[Jonathan Kaiman]"}
{"Content": "[ BARRINGTON, N.H. (AP)  Unlimited political cash would give rank-and-file conservative activists greater sway in picking their representatives, including the president, White House hopeful Ted Cruz told New Hampshire voters on Sunday. Cruz, a first-term senator who represents Texas, said deep-pocketed donors should have the same rights to write giant campaign checks as voters have to put signs in their front yards. Both, Cruz said, were an example of political speech, and he added that money absolutely can be speech. I believe everyone here has a right to speak out on politics as effectively as possible, Cruz told a voter who asked him about the role of the super-rich in politics. Cruz, making his first trip to New Hampshire this year, was using a two-day visit to this early voting state to lay the groundwork for an expected presidential campaign. Three of the seven questions he took during a town hall-style meeting were statements encouraging him to run for president. Cruz steadfastly insisted he was not yet a presidential candidate and said he was merely considering it. I am looking at it very seriously, he said a day after making a campaign-style trip to South Carolina, another early nominating state. After the session, one activist gave Cruz a blank check and told him to write it for whatever amount he needed. Cruz, mindful that accepting the check would trigger his official entrance to the Republican primary, declined but told an aide to follow up with the man after a campaign is official. Stay tuned, he said. But Cruz also told voters his daughter, Caroline, had given him permission to join the presidential race in the hopes that the family puppy would get to play on the White House lawn instead of near their Houston high-rise condo. If you win, that means Snowflake will finally get a backyard to pee in, Cruz said his daughter told him. Cruz, a tea-party favorite, is expecting to formally join a crowded field of presidential hopefuls in the coming weeks. In the meantime, he has been courting party activists and donors to help him counter deep-pocketed rivals such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Asked about the outsized role of money in politics at his first event in New Hampshire this year, Cruz said he understands voters frustration but that cannot trump the constitutional rights to free speech. Right now, the system is crazy, Cruz said of the campaign finance rules. At a later appearance at a GOP fundraiser in New Hampshires rural Grafton County, Cruz said Democrats were working to limit activists rights through a proposed constitutional amendment to restrict campaign spending. The Democrat-backed proposal last year was more an election year posturing than a viable plan to change the Constitution. Is there not one lion of the Left who will stand for free speech? Cruz said in Lincoln. In the Senate, Cruz has proposed lifting all campaign contribution limits in exchange for immediate disclosure. The answer is not to muzzle citizens. It is to empower citizens, Cruz said. Yet Cruz acknowledged that heavy spending had been a headache during his 2012 campaign for Senate. In the Senate race, I had $35 million in nasty attack ads against me, Cruz said. And you know what? It was their Constitutional right to do so.

{"Content": "[ Boeing laid out Tuesday its price for assuring that the forthcoming 777X jet is manufactured in Washington state: a  hardball contract offer for the Machinists and a demanding agenda for a special session of the Legislature. Machinists union members face a watershed vote next week on a   contract offer from Boeing. To ensure they will fabricate the 777Xs giant composite wings and assemble the airplane here, theyll have to hold their noses and sign off on the loss of long-cherished benefits. And in a weeklong special session in Olympia beginning Thursday, Gov. Jay Inslee has asked state legislators to pass a package of bills that include granting Boeing after 2024 estimated state tax savings of $8.7 billion. In a hastily arranged news conference on Election Day, Inslee said Boeing executives have guaranteed that if these two things happen, were going to get the largest aerospace expansion project of my lifetime. These jobs are ours, if we act now, Inslee said. Inslee was flanked by Boeing Commercial Airplanes chief Ray Conner and International Association of Machinists (IAM) District 751 President Tom Wroblewski, although neither spoke or took questions. Just hours earlier, the union leadership agreed to take to its members a bitter pill: a tough Boeing proposal    for anew eight-year contract with big cuts in future pension and health-care benefits. Union members will earn a $10,000 signing bonus if it passes, payable within a month. But the pension change would be a major loss for current employees: Traditional pension accruals would stop, to be replaced by an alternative company-funded retirement savings plan. Clearly the terms were difficult for the Machinists leaders to accept. Only a project as significant as the 777X and the jobs it will bring to this region warrants consideration of the terms contained in Boeings proposal, said Wroblewski in a union statement. While not all will agree with the proposals merits, we believe this is a debate and a decision that ultimately belongs to the members themselves. If passed, the deal ensures Boeing management a full decade of labor peace. Its eight-year span begins at the end of the current contract in 2016., The proposal represents a major poker play by the company to cut its long-term costs, using the future of airplane manufacturing in the Puget Sound area as the high stakes on the table. Securing the Boeing 777X for the Puget Sound means much more than job security for thousands of IAM members, said Wroblewski. It means decades of economic activity for the region. Boeings Conner, in a statement, said the union deal when ratified, will secure and extend thousands of high-wage, high-skilled aerospace jobs and expanded economic opportunity for residents of Puget Sound and Portland for many years to come. Inslee stressed the significance of Washingtons winning the advanced manufacturing facility where the 777Xs carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composite wing will be built, saying that will create a carbon fiber manufacturing industry for future airplanes. He called for swift passage of a raft of bills, including extension of Boeings tax incentives through 2040; a massive $10 billion 10-year transportation package; actions to streamline industrial permitting; education and training initiatives; and a compromise that will satisfy Boeing on the states pending water-quality rule. The 777X is a planned variant of todays 777 that will retain the same metal fuselage but utilize new engines and the new composite wings. The plane is expected to be launched at this months Dubai Air Show and to enter service around 2020. Almost 20,000 Boeing employees work directly or indirectly on the 777 program today. Inslee said that counting support and service jobs, some 56,000 people in the state depend on that jet. State officials said later that the 777X project will produce fiscal benefits to the state from now through 2040 of $17.8 billion. Sweeteners for union, To try to secure a yes vote by the IAMs 31,000 members here and 1,500 more in Portland, Boeing wrapped the bitter pill of its contract proposal in lots of sugar. The IAM deal includes substantial cash awards: not only the big ratification bonus but alsoa golden handshake buyout that would allow retirement with boosted pension terms of $95 per month per year of service for anyone over age 58. The take-aways include significantly higher health-care premiums and, crucially, the radically changed pension plan. The new pension plan would have the company contribute a fixed percentage of gross salary into a retirement savings account each year: 10 percent the first year, 8 percent the second; 6 percent the third, and 4 percent every year thereafter. The IAM is the last Boeing union with a traditional pension, and the company has sought unsuccessfully in multiple contract negotiations to move away from a defined-benefit pension plan to such a defined-contributions savings plan. The offer would also change the wage structure so that new hires would take 16years to reach the top of the pay scale instead of the 6years it takes today. One machinist summed up Boeings strategy this way: Offer the big signing bonus to entice younger members who perhaps arent thinking of staying their entire working lives with the company. And use the early-retirement package to swing the votes of those planning to retire in the next few years. For everyone else, this machinist said, the offer is a losing deal. However, another machinist said the agreement is the best available. He said that layoffs could continue next year as the 787 program sheds workers no longer needed to fix earlier production problems. He said the early-retirement buyout will stave off those layoffs as older workers take the offer. This is an incentive that will save younger people with families, he said. I think reality is, this thing will pass. A company source said that during secret negotiations over the past months, Boeing moved somewhat toward the union on the pension and health-care numbers. However, among the union rank and file there is a widespread conviction that Boeing presented its offer largely on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. One union official told members that if the offer is voted down, Boeing the next day will put the 777X work out to bid by other states. Boeing declined to comment on what happens if the vote fails. Sen. Patty Murray, who acted as a mediator between the IAM and Boeing over the past two months, offered an optimistic outlook. Im encouraged and hopeful that we are close to an agreement that will make the Puget Sound home to the 777X, Murray said. Everyones goal should be a mutually agreeable solution that will provide labor peace and help rev up our states economic engine for the foreseeable future. The union said it will provide IAM members full details of all contract changes in the proposal  when printing is completed and will communicate voting arrangements as soon as they are ready.

{"Content": "[ BOISE  Same-sex marriage is now legal in all 50 states, but nestled in the Idaho Constitution remains a provision that defines marriage as only between a man and a woman. The Supreme Court struck down all gay-marriage bans nationwide last week, making Idahos constitutional marriage definition unenforceable. However, removing the language will likely be an uphill battle. Amending the Idaho Constitution first requires approval from the Republican-dominated Legislature. The proposal must then win a simple majority in a voter referendum  a tough task for even lesser politically charged initiatives. Idaho is one of 30 states that amended their constitutions to ban gay marriage that have not yet take steps to repeal their amendments, even though they have been rendered unenforceable by the Supreme Courts gay-marriage decision. It might be difficult to remove the language, but its the right thing to do, said Leo Morales, acting executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Idaho. Lawmakers have sworn an oath to uphold the law. It makes sense to clean up the books. Idahos ban has been enshrined in the state constitution since 2006 after winning 63 percent of the vote. Gay-rights supporters argue removal is the natural next step to comply with the Supreme Courts ruling. But Republican lawmakers and gay-marriage opponents counter that there is no legal need to change the constitution. Idaho should not remove that language, said Julie Lynde, executive director of Cornerstone Family Council. There is no reason to obliterate traditional marriage. Its a symbolic and historic piece of language. Furthermore, when Idaho lawmakers gather in Boise at the beginning of 2016, theyll be kicking off the legislative session in an election year. Republican lawmakers will be less likely to cast a vote that could be used against them by an opponent. My opinion is that no legislative action is required, said Senate Majority Leader Bart Davis of Idaho Falls. Whether the Legislature chooses to do something or not, thats still up in the air. But right now, (the ban) is unenforceable as required by law. The Idaho Constitution is subject to the Supreme Court, meaning the state must defer to the courts decision even if its own laws differ. But having conflicting state and federal laws can cause confusion, Morales said. For example, in 2013, a sheriff in Kootenai County declared that the Boy Scouts of America promoted a lifestyle that violated the states sodomy law. Morales said the sheriff incorrectly interpreted an unenforceable state law because it was still on the books, even though the Supreme Court banned laws that attempted to regulate or criminalize sexual activity among consenting adults in 2003. Idahos history of removing obsolete provisions from its constitution began with the original document in 1890. At the time, Idaho disenfranchised anyone who practiced polygamy, encouraged polygamy or supported organizations encouraging polygamy as a way to strip Mormons of their right to vote, holding office or serving on juries. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints disavowed the practice of plural marriage that same year. Today, the Legislature is prominently led by Mormons in both chambers, but the state didnt remove the anti-Mormon language until 1982. More than 100,000 people  a third of voters  voted to keep the ban.]", "Date": "20150705", "Title": "[Idaho constitution still has gay-marriage ban]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/idaho-constitution-still-has-gay-marriage-ban/", "Author": "[KIMBERLEE KRUESI]"}
{"Content": "[ BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP)  Challenging Hillary Rodham Clinton from the left, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders kicked off his presidential bid Tuesday with a pitch to liberals to join him in a political revolution to transform the nations economy and politics. Sanders, who entered the Democratic race in late April, formally opened his White House campaign in Burlington, where he was first elected mayor by defeating a longtime Democratic incumbent by 10 votes. Three decades later, Sanders is the underdog again, vowing to campaign on an agenda to elevate issues like income inequality, campaign finance and climate change. With your support and the support of millions of people throughout this country, we begin a political revolution to transform our country economically, politically, socially and environmentally, Sanders declared to about 5,000 supporters along the shore of Lake Champlain. Now is not the time for thinking small, he said. Now is not the time for the same old-same old establishment politics and stale inside-the-Beltway ideas. A self-described democratic socialist, the 73-year-old Sanders has a following among liberals that could push Clinton to the left. In a lengthy address, the white-haired senator said there is something profoundly wrong when so much of the nations income goes to the top 1 percent of all earners. This grotesque level of inequality is immoral, he said. It is bad economics. It is unsustainable. His campaign kickoff in Burlingtons Waterfront Park, built on industrial land reclaimed during Sanders stint as mayor, offered a quintessential Vermont backdrop: a sun-splashed Lake Champlain, where boaters took in the scene from sailboats and motorboats. The senator was praised by a lineup of supporters, including the founders of Vermonts popular ice cream company, Ben & Jerrys, and environmental activist Bill McKibben, who predicted the campaign might someday lead to a mountaintop named Mount Sanders. Several leading Vermont Democrats were notably absent, including Sen. Patrick Leahy, Gov. Peter Shumlin and former Gov. Howard Dean, all of whom are supporting Clinton. Liberals, some of whom are wary of Clinton, have unsuccessfully sought to draw Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren into the race. But in Warrens absence, Sanders hopes to fill the void as he proposes ways to rein in Wall Street banks, tackle mounting college debt and create a government-financed jobs program. Clinton is in a commanding position by any measure, far in front of both Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley, who is expected to get into the race Saturday. The Democratic field could also grow to include former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee. But it remains to be seen if liberals will coalesce around a challenger to the former secretary of state or if that slice of the anti-Clinton electorate will splinter among several candidates. Sanders, an independent in the Senate who often votes with the Democrats, has raised more than $4 million since announcing his campaign in late April and suggested in an interview with The Associated Press last week that raising $50 million for the primaries was a possibility. In his address, Sanders made clear he would seek to be on the forefront of liberal causes. He described the economic system as rigged against middle-class families and vowed to raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations and to oppose trade deals that would ship jobs overseas. To counter big money in politics, he said he would push for the public financing of elections. To build upon President Barack Obamas health care law, Sanders supports a single-payer health care system. Instead of cutting Social Security, he said, the nation should expand Social Security benefits. To address climate change, he said, Congress should pass a carbon tax to help transition off fossil fuels. He noted that he voted against the invasion of Iraq in 2003  Clinton has disavowed her vote in support of it  and said the U.S. should be part of an international coalition to defeat the Islamic State group. Sanders has introduced legislation to make tuition free at public colleges and universities, a major piece of Warrens agenda. Clintons campaign has signaled that she intends to make debt-free college a major piece of her campaign, too. Richard Robinson, a Burlington retiree who attended the rally, said it was important for Sanders to be in the race, just to get the power in the party to listen to him  particularly Hillary.

{"Content": "[ CAMP DAVID, Maryland (AP)  In a show of unity, U.S. and Afghan officials laid the groundwork for new relations between the two countries on Monday, including plans to seek American funding to maintain an Afghan security force of 352,000 and long-term counterterrorism efforts. Discussions over future U.S. troop levels continue as the war winds down. In an all-day session at the Camp David presidential retreat in Marylands Catoctin mountains, dozens of U.S. and Afghan officials, including Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Ash Carter, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and chief executive Abdullah Abdullah gathered to relaunch a relationship strained by nearly 14-years of war and often-testy relations with former Afghan President Hamid Karzai. During the meeting, the U.S. agreed to seek funding through 2017 for an Afghan force of 352,000, a level the nation has yet to meet, Carter said. U.S. officials said the Afghan government is trying to improve recruiting to make up for security forces who leave the service. They also agreed to require the Afghan government to complete specific reforms and meet other milestones in order to receive up to $800 million. U.S. officials said the Afghans suggested the incentive-based funding idea. The leaders of the two nations also said they would restart routine ministerial-level Defense and State Department meetings. Ghani is to meet with President Barack Obama on Tuesday, an engagement during which officials expect the U.S. to make clear its decision to slow the pace of the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan. Ghani and Abdullah fought a contentious election last year to replace Karzai, and their power-sharing agreement was lauded by Kerry, who played a key role in brokering it. It is easy today to underestimate the measure of courage and leadership and selflessness that was demanded at that moment, and that both of these leaders continue to show in their commitment to a unity government, Kerry said. He added that huge challenges remain but that the agreements to be reached this week will help pave the way for stability and security. Kerry said that the joint appearance at Camp David, along with the White House meetings, should serve as notice to the Taliban that the U.S.-Afghan relationship is back on track and they should negotiate rather than fight. All of these underscore to any Taliban, to anybody who wants to engage in violence that we are prepared in the long term to support our friends in Afghanistan, Kerry said. Obama has promised to pull remaining U.S. troops out by the end of his presidency. But deficiencies in the Afghan security forces, heavy casualties in the ranks of the Afghan army and police, a fragile new government and fears that Islamic State fighters could gain a foothold in Afghanistan have combined to persuade Obama to slow the withdrawal. Instead of trimming the current U.S. force of 9,800 to 5,500 by the end of this year, U.S. officials say the administration now might keep many of them there well into 2016. Obama has said that after that, the U.S. will maintain only an embassy-based security force in Kabul of perhaps 1,000 troops. Ghani, who has expressed worries about Islamic State militants trying to gain a foothold in his country, has pressed to keep more U.S. troops there longer, but Obama has promised to end both wars in Afghanistan before his presidency ends in January 2017. Both Carter and Kerry acknowledged the importance of the U.S continuing its counterterrorism missions in Afghanistan, even into 2017. Kerry said the U.S. is concerned about reports that Islamic State militants are recruiting in Afghanistan and that some Taliban are rebranding themselves as Islamic State members. He said the U.S. will continue to maintain a counterterrorism effort that is focused on al-Qaida at this moment but would also have the ability to assist the Afghan forces as they provide security for their nation. During a visit to the Pentagon earlier Monday, Ghani thanked U.S. troops and taxpayers for their sacrifices in nearly 14 years of war. He pledged that his impoverished country will not remain a burden to the West. We do not now ask what the United States can do for us, Ghani said. We want to say what Afghanistan will do for itself and for the world, he added. On arrival at Camp David, Ghani emphasized what he called a new phase of the U.S.-Afghan relationship. Its time for Afghanistan to reciprocate the gift that the United States has so generously provided over the years, he said. Reciprocating the gift means owning our problems, solving them and asking of ourselves what we must do for ourselves and for the region. Ghanis relationship with Washington stands in stark contrast to that of his predecessor, Karzai, whose antagonism toward the U.S. culminated in a refusal to sign security agreements with Washington and NATO before leaving office last year. Ghani signed the pacts within days of becoming president in September, and he has since enjoyed a close relationship with American diplomats and military leaders.

{"Content": "[ CAP-HAITIEN, Haiti (AP)  Mathieux Saint Fleur has been virtually blind for two decades. In less than 24 hours, he will see again. As the 75-year-old Haitian patient lies on an operating table, a U.S. eye surgeon-turned-politician reassures him in broken Creole that the surgery is almost over. People need to be encouraged its not much longer, said Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul, an ophthalmologist by training, without taking his eyes off Saint Fleur. Jeb Bush, Rand Paul plan events in Seattle, Bellevue, As many of Pauls competitors courted voters in Iowa and New Hampshire over the last week, Kentuckys fiery junior senator joined a team of eye surgeons on a four-day mission to Haiti, giving vision to nearly 200 who would not have been blind if they lived in the United States. But here in the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, curable blindness from common ailments such as cataracts is normal. If Jesus can give me back my vision, I will be happy, said Saint Fleur, who would soon have a cataract almost the size of a dime removed from his left eye. The aging man, who balances himself with a worn walking stick, said he wanted his vision back simply to see his family again. He was among scores of Haitians  adults and children  who streamed through the hallways of Vision Plus Clinique, a nondescript, two-story building set in the heart of Haitis largest north-coast city and guarded by a team of armed police and a private security detail for the mission. Despite the humanitarian focus, Pauls precarious place in the 2016 presidential contest was never quite forgotten. Considered a formidable White House contender for much of the last year, the first-term senators standing in the GOP field has suffered following billionaire businessman Donald Trumps sharp rise. Declining poll numbers could jeopardize Pauls place in next months prime-time debate as he struggles to attract major donors to fund a national network borrowed from his fathers passionate following. Paul acknowledged his recent struggle during an interview at a Cap-Haitien hotel, where razor-wire protects the outer walls and raw sewage flows into the nearby ocean. Its sort of like a schoolyard. Once you got em down, everybody piles on, Paul said of the 2016 contest. And Ive been under a dog pile for a couple of weeks. There may be cause for optimism, however, in the face of Gary Heavin, a cigar-chomping billionaire and Republican donor who was at Pauls side much of the week, having arrived with the senator and some of the other doctors on his private jet. Heavin, the Texas-based founder of the Curves health club franchise, has been active in Haitian charity work since a 2010 earthquake left more than 100,000 dead and millions homeless in the nations capital, Port-au-Prince. Roughly 75 percent of the country remains without electricity. If I support anyone in the Republican Party, its him, Heavin said in an interview outside the clinic while Paul worked with patients inside. He said he has the capacity to donate more than $10 million and would back Paul if confident in his ability to influence the process. Paul has worked aggressively to broaden his support beyond the small, but passionate group of his fathers loyal supporters. Yet many prominent donors and GOP establishment figures have balked, largely because of the younger Pauls foreign policy views. Like his father, former Rep. Ron Paul, Rand Paul favors a dramatically smaller footprint in the world. He has proposed federal budgets that would eliminate virtually all U.S. funding to foreign governments. He didnt back off such positions while in Haiti. The U.S. has had a big role for many, many years here, said Paul, who also is seeking re-election to the Senate. It hasnt fixed things. We borrow it from China to give it to Haiti. Thats not charity, thats just bad policy, he added, encouraging private donations instead of government support. He didnt rule out government aid altogether, however, particularly for food and water in an immediate disaster. At the eye center, at least, it was easy to find evidence that Pauls privately-funded mission made a difference. The trip was organized by the University of Utahs Moran Eye Center, which regularly leads trips designed to train local doctors and address curable blindness in poor areas around the world. Cataract surgeries often take no longer than 20 minutes, allowing teams of volunteer surgeons to perform dozens in a single day. The Haiti group completed 109 surgeries on the three days Paul was on hand and expected to finish nearly 200 by the time the full group left the country on Saturday. On Tuesday morning, the day after his surgery, Saint Fleur sat in a room crowded with patients quietly waiting for the bandages to come off. He was speechless for a few moments after the white gauze was peeled away. Then he began to smile. I see! I see! he said, joy spreading across his face. And with shaking hands, he began reaching out for nearby medical staff, hugging anyone he could and affectionately touching their faces. I love you, he told a nurse.

{"Content": "[ Central African Republic President Francois Bozize and the rebels who sought to overthrow him have reached a deal that will allow him to stay in office until his term ends in 2016, officials said Friday. The announcement came after several days of peace talks in Gabon, which were organized after an alliance of rebels groups swept through the north of the country and seized control of a dozen towns. On Friday, Bozize publicly shook hands with the rebel representatives  whom he had denounced as terrorists just two days before  and other political opponents to seal the deal that spares his ouster. The rebel offensive stopped short of the capital of Bangui but posed the gravest threat to Bozize during his nearly 10 years in power. The president, backed into a corner, was forced to make a number of concessions and to make true of his promise to encourage a government of national unity, Margaret Vogt,  U.N. special envoy to Central African Republic, told the U.N. Security Council by videoconference from Libreville, Gabon. Bozize said he would move to dissolve the government Saturday so that a national unity government could be formed that would be led by a prime minister chosen by the political opposition. For me, its a victory for peace because from now on Central Africans in conflict zones will be finally freed from their suffering, Bozize said upon arriving at the airport back in Bangui. I ask everyone to stay calm. As for me, I still remain the president of Central African Republic. News of the agreement, which includes a cease-fire, was met with relief on the streets of Bangui, the capital of Central African Republic. This agreement could help to calm the anxiety of people who are truly afraid, said Albert Mbaya, 40, a philosophy professor in Bangui. While Fridays agreement appears to suggest a swift resolution to the rapidly advancing rebellion, it still remains to be seen whether forces on the ground will abide by the deals reached in Gabon. Seleka, which means alliance in the local Sango language, is made up of four separate groups  some of whom have previously fought one another. Fridays announcement also does not explicitly address some of the broader grievances raised by the rebels, including aid to the deeply impoverished north of Central African Republic. The fighters, who began their collective offensive on Dec. 10, had previously called for Bozize to step down from power and had dismissed his calls to form a national unity government. Under the deal announced Friday, neither the prime minister nor the president would be eligible to take part in the next presidential election, Vogt said. Fridays agreement also includes a provision that legislative elections will be organized in a year, according to a statement read by Chadian Foreign Affairs Minister Moussa Faki Mahamat. The mandate of President Bozize is a constitutional question. We cannot challenge the Central African Republics constitution, said Chadian President Idriss Deby, who presided over the closing ceremony for the talks. Bozize seized power in 2003 after a rebellion, and later went on to win elections in 2005 and 2011, though the United States and others have described the votes as deeply flawed. His government gained support earlier this month when militaries from neighboring countries Chad, Gabon, Republic of Congo and Cameroon all sent forces to help stabilize Central African Republic. Additionally, South Africa also has sent military aid. Despite Central African Republics wealth of gold, diamonds, timber and uranium, the government remains perpetually cash-strapped.  The land-locked nation of 4.4 million, a former French colony, is among the poorest countries in the world. , Larson reported from Dakar, Senegal.

{"Content": "[ CENTRAL, S.C. (AP)  South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham opened his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination Monday with a grim accounting of radical Islam running wild in a world imperiled also by Irans nuclear ambitions. He dedicated himself to defeating U.S. adversaries  a commitment that would place thousands of troops back in Iraq, essentially re-engaging in a war launched in 2003. Ive got one simple message, he told supporters in the small town where he grew up. I have more experience with our national security than any other candidate in this race. That includes you, Hillary. In that fashion, he took on Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton  the former secretary of state  as well as non-interventionists in his own party and rivals with little to no foreign policy experience. Graham, 59, becomes the first candidate in either party to hail from one of the first four states that cast presidential primary ballots. Iowa and New Hampshire lead the process, followed by South Carolina and Nevada. Having won his third term in November, Graham is a prominent Senate voice in seeking a more muscular foreign policy and one who casts the threats facing the United States in particularly dark terms. Simply put, radical Islam is running wild, he said. They have more safe havens, more money, more weapons and more capability to strike our homeland than any time since 9/11. They are large, they are rich, and theyre entrenched. He said as president, hed make them small, poor and on the run. Im afraid some Americans have grown tired of fighting them, he said. I have bad news to share with you  the radical Islamists are not tired of fighting you. Despite his focus on Islamic State militants with footholds in those two nations, Graham said Iran poses the gravest threat. If the U.S. does not head off a nuclear capability in Iran, Graham said, Iran will trigger a nuclear arms race in the least stable region on Earth, and make it more likely that people who aspire to genocide will have the most effective means to commit it. He said recently there is no avoiding the reality that more Americans will have to fight and die to defend the country. His approach contrasts with that of fellow senator and presidential candidate, Kentuckys Rand Paul, who favors less military intervention. And his blunt talk about more troops and casualties stands out even among other Republican contenders who promise to quash Islamic State militants, but sidestep details. Polls suggest a majority of American adults support military action against the group commonly called ISIS. But support drops when respondents are asked specifically about a ground war. Graham came to Congress an outspoken member of the conservative freshman class that brought Republicans a majority in 1994. Yet hes since joined with Democrats on some contentious votes. He backed a 2012 immigration overhaul and voted to end a 2013 partial government shutdown, for example. He also backed President Barack Obamas two Supreme Court nominees. That earned Graham enmity among some Republicans, but he said Monday his willingness to work with anybody is necessary. Graham said wealthier members of his generation will have to take fewer Social Security and Medicare benefits, while younger workers may have to work longer and pay more. We have to fix entitlement programs to make sure people who need the benefits the most receive them, he said. Thats going to require determined presidential leadership. That statement impressed Daniel Nichols, 35, of Central. You know, I think he may be right on Social Security, Nichols said. I wonder if hes being a little too truthful when he says that, though. Graham leaned heavily on his personal story Monday, delivering his speech in front of the building where he grew up and his parents ran a pool hall, bar and restaurant. Grahams parents died when he was in college, leaving him as guardian to his then 13-year-old sister, Darline. We depended on Social Security benefits to survive, Graham said. As president, Ill gladly do what it takes to save a program that once saved my family. Graham planned appearances this week in New Hampshire and Iowa if the Senate schedule lets him go. __, Associated Press reporters Alex Sanz and Meg Kinnard contributed to this report.

{"Content": "[ CHICAGO (AP)  Hillary Rodham Clintons presidential campaign will center on boosting economic security for the middle class and expanding opportunities for working families, while casting the former senator and secretary of state as a tenacious fighter able to get results, two senior advisers said Saturday. President Barack Obama all but endorsed her, saying I think she would be an excellent president. The senior advisers provided the first preview of the message Clinton planned to convey when she launches her long-anticipated campaign on Sunday with an online video. Until now, the former first lady has offered only hints of what would drive her if she were to run a second time for the White House. The strategy described by Clintons advisers has echoes of Obamas 2012 re-election campaign. He framed the choice for voters as between Democrats focused on the middle class and Republicans wanting to protect the wealthy and return to policies that led to the 2008 economic collapse. The advisers said Clinton will argue that voters have a similar choice in 2016. Clinton also intends to sell herself as being able to work with Congress, businesses and world leaders. That approach could be perceived as a critique of Obama, Clintons rival for the nomination in 2008. He has largely been unable to fulfill his pledge to end Washingtons intense partisanship and found much of his presidency stymied by gridlock with Congress. The Clinton advisers spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss her plans ahead of Sundays announcement. People familiar with the plans say Clinton will travel to Iowa and other early-voting states to hold small events with residents in the days after the videos release. In New York on Saturday, at the final event put on by Ready for Hillary, a group not connected with her campaign thats worked for the past few years to stoke excitement for it, enthusiastic supporters joined elected officials and local party leaders to celebrate the launch to come. After she left the State Department she could have slipped into grandmother-hood, but people want to call her back into public service, said Jarret Berg, 29, a Democratic staffer in the New York legislature. Its time for her. As her official announcement loomed, the Republican National Committee linked Clinton to Obama, a regular focus of criticism from the GOP. All Hillary Clinton is offering is a continuation of the same big government ideas that have grown Washington instead of the middle class, RNC spokesman Michael Short said in a statement. Thats why voters want fresh leadership and a new direction, not four more years of Obamas failed policies. Clinton is not expected to roll out detailed policy positions in the first weeks of her campaign. Advisers said she planned to talk about ways families can increase take-home pay, the importance of expanding early childhood education and making higher education more affordable. Its not yet clear whether that will include a noticeable break with Obama on economic policy. The GOP has hammered Obamas approach as anti-business and insufficient in the wake of the recession. The White House says the economy has improved significantly in recent years. The unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent in March, but manufacturing and new home construction slowed, cheaper gas has yet to ignite consumer spending and participation in the labor force remains sluggish. Clinton will enter the race as the overwhelming favorite for her partys nomination. Still, her team has said her early strategy is designed to avoid appearing to take that nomination for granted. Clinton received an early boost Saturday from Obama, who was asked if he would be involved in her expected campaign. She was a formidable candidate in 2008. She was a great supporter of mine in the general election. She was an outstanding secretary of state. She is my friend. I think she would be an excellent president, and Im not on the ballot so Im not going to step on her lines, Obama said from Panama City as he wrapped up participation in a summit of Western Hemisphere leaders. Clintons early events will include discussions at colleges, day care centers and private homes, and stops at coffee shops and diners. After about a month of such events, Clinton will give a broader speech outlining more specifics about her rationale for running. Clintons husband, Bill, and daughter, Chelsea, are unlikely to appear at her early events. Bill Clinton, the former two-term president, said recently that he wanted to play a role as a backstage adviser in his wifes campaign. Advisers said Bill Clinton has been engaged with his wife in some of the policy discussions leading up to this weekends rollout. To prepare for the campaign, Clinton has spent months meeting with economic policy experts, including Heather Boushey, whose research focuses on inequality, and Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist and retirement policy expert. The policy development process has been overseen by aides Jake Sullivan and Dan Schwerin. In the days before her announcement, Clinton has been holding lengthy meetings with her staff, sometimes joining them at her crowded personal offices in midtown Manhattan and other times participating by phone. She is expected to reach out to donors in the coming weeks, but does not plan to headline many fundraising events over the next month. Clintons growing team of staffers began working Friday out of a new campaign headquarters in Brooklyn. They gathered Saturday to hear from campaign manager-in-waiting Robby Mook, who told them the campaign would value teamwork, diversity, discipline and humility. Mook distributed a memo titled We are Hillary for America that included several guiding principles, including a vow to work together and respect each other. The campaign, the memo said, is not about Hillary Clinton and not about us  its about the everyday Americans who are trying to build a better life for themselves and their families. The meeting was described by a Democratic official in attendance who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe a private strategy session. The memo was first reported by Politico.

Next, the agency will ask the Legislature for authorization before sending a proposal to the November 2016 ballot in urban Snohomish, King and Pierce counties. I think we have a wonderful story to tell the Legislature, said board Vice-Chair Paul Roberts, who is also a member of the Everett City Council. He mentioned the regions biggest manufacturing facility at Boeing, and two-hour commutes from Everett to Seattle this fall. Sound Transit is improving its efficiency in delivering projects, he added. The next light-rail segment, a $1.8 billion, three-mile subway from Westlake Station to Capitol Hill and Husky Stadium, opens in early 2016, a half-year sooner than forecast. Tax rates for Sound Transit 3  the 2016 ballot measure  will probably be less than the full amount officials request from Olympia. A ST3 project map almost certainly will include new stretches of light rail from Lynnwood to Everett, Overlake to Redmond, and Kent-Des Moines Road to Federal Way. Other suggestions include Ballard, West Seattle, Eastgate or Issaquah spurs, and better bus-rapid transit on Interstate 405. New taxes might bring in $9 billion over 15 years. When combined with income streams from the 1996 and 2008 ballot measures, the project list could grow to $15 billion, said spokesman Geoff Patrick. Board Chairman Dow Constantine, the King County executive, said he wants the big numbers out in public long before a 2016 election, when a presidential race should entice young, pro-transit voters. People are smart, and they realize that permanent infrastructure that changes mobility in the region requires investment over a number of years, he said. Sound Transit budgets, much like state highway funds, are burdened by debt, requiring new taxes to extend the corridors. Analyses by Sound Transit Finance Director Brian McCartan show that to provide just the 50 miles of light rail already approved, plus bus and commuter-train service, the agency needs to maintain its existing 0.9 percent sales tax through the late 2030s. Some bond payments are proposed until 2053. And the board Thursday approved a $1.33 billion, low-interest federal loan to help build the $4 billion Chinatown-Bellevue-Overlake rail line  to be paid off in 2058.

{"Content": "[ CLEVELAND  Donald Trump needs to act presidential. Jeb Bush has to erase the notion that hes just another Bush. And some other Republicans have to make enough of a first impression on voters that they can vault into the top tier of a crowded presidential field. On TV: The 2-hour GOP debate. Time: 6 p.m. PST. Channel: Fox News.Where:Cleveland, Ten Republicans will vie tonight in the first Republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign. The other seven candidates can participate in a one-hour forum starting at 2 p.m. The debate at Clevelands Quicken Loans Arena is likely to shake up and redefine the Republican field, the biggest in modern times. Heres what the contenders need to do to stay in, or reach, the front of the pack:, Donald Trump: Can he look and act presidential? He needs to show (a) hes thought out some policy positions and (b) he has a commander in chiefs temperament. Whats his remedy for overhauling the nations health-care system? Will there be detail or another burst of vivid sound bites?, Jeb Bush: Can he be pithy, and can he separate himself from his brother? The former governor of Florida tends to ramble and get too nuanced, not a recipe for standing out in rapid-fire debates. Hes likely to get challenged on his support for a path to legal status for many immigrants in the U.S. illegally and his support for Common Core educational standards. Scott Walker: Will he get beyond the talking points? The governor of Wisconsin wows Republicans when he boasts about how he took on unions in a budget fight. But its not all that it seems, and hes likely to be confronted about shortfalls that required tough spending cuts. He usually answers with well-rehearsed talking points, but he must go further and impress viewers that he knows what hes talking about. Marco Rubio: Can he demonstrate gravitas and commitment? The Florida senator has to defend his 2013 support for a comprehensive immigration overhaul that included a path to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. illegally, and then his move away from that approach. He wants to come across as a national-security expert and needs to talk comfortably and authoritatively about terrorist threats. Ted Cruz: Will he try to out-Trump Trump? He cant resist the quick hit, and its landed him in political jeopardy while Trump has won the outraged voters, so far. The senator from Texas went for broke recently, calling the Senate Republican leader a liar. Will Cruz separate himself further from the establishment?, Rand Paul: He sank to eighth in the Fox News poll averages that determined debate status. The senator from Kentucky seems unable to get traction, even after this weeks leadership role in trying to divert federal funds from Planned Parenthood. He must find a way to stand out in the pack. John Kasich: Will conservatives accept him? Hell be introducing himself to much of the public, and his regular-guy demeanor and ease discussing issues should help. But will the governor of Ohio appear presidential? And might he seem too centrist and accommodating to satisfy the conservative base?, Mike Huckabee: Can he demonstrate mainstream appeal? Hes likely to keep pounding away with provocative statements, largely aimed at his Christian right constituency. The former Arkansas governor must show a greater grasp of mainstream issues, notably the economy, health care and foreign policy, to break out of this tier. Ben Carson: Is he too understated to make a splash? Hell be steady, thoughtful, conservative, and maybe too calm and quiet to stand out. The retired neurosurgeon has stayed away from the sort of incendiary comments that marked his early political efforts. But what does he know about how to fight terrorism or manage an economy?, Chris Christie: Can he calm down? His no-prisoners style is perfect for a debate. But the governor of New Jersey has to erase the impression that hes too quick to anger when challenged. These candidates didnt have the support in national polls to qualify for the debate under rules set by Fox News. Theyre invited to the 2 p.m. forum, which will allow them to appear sequentially. Rick Perry: Is he 2012s news? The former governor of Texas had a huge opportunity last time and blew it. Hes got to get through all the new faces and the old concerns, and winding up in the other forum could be further evidence his time is up. Carly Fiorina: How does she break out of the pack? Expect the former business executive to keep stressing her business rsum and criticizing Hillary Rodham Clinton, which she does like no one else in the field. Lindsey Graham: Is he too accommodating to Democrats? He has to show conservatives hes really one of them. Theyre unhappy with his willingness to work with Democrats. The senator from South Carolina also needs to explain why he thinks he has a shot. Bobby Jindal: Can the policy-wonk Jindal reappear? Hes fashioned himself as the candidate of the Christian right. Can he return to being the two-term governor of Louisiana known for his budget-management and health-care expertise?, Rick Santorum: What happened to the winner of the 2012 Iowa caucus? The former senator from Pennsylvania has a rough task, convincing his religious right constituency he deserves another chance. So far, that group seems more inclined to consider Cruz, Huckabee and Carson. George Pataki: The three-term governor of New York is hoping to break through in New Hampshire. He can only hope independents and moderates tune in. Jim Gilmore: The former governor of Virginia will talk national security. Viewers may wonder why someone who hasnt won a race since 1997 and was crushed in his 2008 Senate bid should be considered. Keep these points in mind:, How far can candidates go challenging Donald Trump?, Will rivals demand he explain his branding undocumented Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists? Trump has insulted most of these candidates, and this is their chance to return fire. And what will it cost them? Think about whether they look better if they go after him, or he does?, Will Trump evolve from showman to potential president?, While hes comfortably ahead in most polls, Trumps negatives are also huge. Skeptics see him as a shallow-minded distraction. This week, Trump posted a Facebook video saying he wanted rivals to answer one question: How will you make America great again? Trump needs to answer that himself, and say how he can go beyond the quips and sound bites to get things done. Is it time for a new generation?, Walker, 47, and Rubio, 44, are the years biggest curiosities. Each boasts a strong political rsum and plenty of campaign cash. Walker wowed Iowa Republicans this year demanding that the federal government adopt the same spending restraints as his state. Rubio, from the nations premier swing state, has been on the short list of future presidents since he won a Senate seat in 2010. Who speaks to and for Christian conservatives?, A sizable bloc of Republicans is eager to rally around a firebrand whos fiercely anti-abortion, wont relent in trying to repeal Obamacare, thinks Common Core is federal control of schools and is appalled by same-sex marriage. Santorum won these voters in 2012. This time, hes one of many  Carson, Huckabee, Cruz and Walker  seeking their approval.

When Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly asked Donald Trump about calling women such things as fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals, he dismissed it with a joke, saying: Only Rosie ODonnell. While the audience laughed, Kelly did not. Trump brushed it aside as political correctness, and turned on Kelly. I dont frankly have time for total political correctness. And to be honest with you, this country doesnt have time, either. Jeb Bush. He came with a concise argument aimed at those who think hes too liberal, noting he cut taxes every year as governor of Florida, increased reserves and won a AAA bond rating. I governed as a conservative and I govern effectively, he said. We left the state better off because I applied conservative principles in a purple state the right way, and people rose up. Ben Carson.

I could take issue. But we dont have time. He did, but didnt use it. Chris Christie. Christie came through when he challenged Rand Paul over criticisms of National Security Agency spying. The governor of New Jersey noted that he alone in the field was a federal prosecutor, and in New Jersey the 2001 terrorist attacks were a personal issue. I will make no apologies ever, he said. Ted Cruz. The senator from Texas showed his skills as a debater, though he didnt get many opportunities to engage with rivals on the crowded stage. He asserted his main claim, that hes an outsider even in Washington, and eager to challenge even his own partys leaders. Mike Huckabee. The former governor of Arkansas made a strong appeal to Christian conservatives with a clearly worded pitch to invoke the Fifth and 14th amendments to protect unborn children from abortions. John Kasich. The Ohio governor engaged Trump, saying hed touched a nerve among frustrated voters but that people like himself had other solutions. Dry at times, he still showed compassion, particularly explaining why taking more federal Medicaid money had been immense help to the working poor. Rand Paul. The senator from Kentucky jumped in at times to challenge Trump, calling him out for refusing to vow support for the GOP nominee and rule out a third-party run himself.

{"Content": "[ CLEVELAND (AP)  A combative Donald Trump, the billionaire businessman-turned-presidential candidate, jolted the first Republican debate of the 2016 campaign by warning he might run as an independent if denied the GOP nomination. His startling declaration left his onstage rivals scrambling to compete for attention the rest of the night. Asked in the debates opening minutes whether he could rule out a third-party run, Trump declared Thursday night, I will not make the pledge at this time. He also refused to apologize for making crude comments about women, defended his changing policy positions and tangled with the debate moderators. While Trump was characteristically bombastic, most of the contenders standing alongside him clamored for their piece of the spotlight without engaging him directly. They quarreled over immigration, terrorism and gay marriage, each casting himself as the strongest to take on Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton. They also assailed President Barack Obama and his nuclear deal with Iran. The closest former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a favorite of the partys moderate, establishment wing, came to tangling with Trump was a gentle critique of the businessmans over-the-top rhetoric. Mr. Trumps language is divisive, Bush said. Were not going to win by doing what Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton do every day  dividing the country. On immigration, one of the main topics of the night, Bush defended his call for a path to legal status for some of the people living in the U.S. illegally, an unpopular position among some Republican voters who equate legal status with amnesty. The great majority of people coming here have no other option, Bush said. Trump in particular has pushed the issue of immigration throughout the summer, drawing criticism for saying Mexican immigrants are rapists. He said Thursday that he had been told that by border patrol agents, and he took credit for immigration being an issue in the campaign. If it werent for me, you wouldnt even be talking about illegal immigration, he said, despite the fact that immigration has been a hot-button issue in presidential campaigns for years. Trumps blunt style was in line with the approach hes taken to his campaign throughout the summer, appealing to voters frustrated with career politicians and perplexing his rivals. He entered the first debate leading the polls in a field filled with governors and senators. Seventeen Republicans are seeking the partys nomination, but only 10 were invited by debate host Fox News to participate in the main event based on their showing in recent polls. The remaining seven were relegated to a pre-debate forum. On stage in his home state, Ohio Gov. John Kasich sought to raise his profile by striking an optimistic tone on the economy, saying all Americans need an opportunity to share in this great American dream. He said that while he favored traditional marriage, he had recently attended a same-sex wedding and would support his children if they were gay. A raucous crowd cheered the candidates on throughout the debate in Cleveland, the same city where Republicans will nominate their general election candidate next summer. No Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio. While the candidates peppered their remarks with barbs about Clinton, they avoided lengthy attacks on her record as secretary of state and the deadly attack in Benghazi, Libya. Only late in the debate did Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker raise the controversy surrounding her use of personal email and a private server while serving in the Obama administration. Probably the Russian and Chinese governments know more about Hillary Clintons email server than do the members of the U.S. Congress, Walker said. The first debate highlighted deep divisions within the Republican Party, with Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul representing a segment of GOP voters frustrated with military action overseas and what they see as infringements on personal liberties. In a lengthy exchange with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Paul defended his opposition to the USA Patriot Act and laws giving government access to Americans phone records. He said he wanted to collect more information from terrorists, not law-abiding Americans. Christie, a former U.S. attorney, was dismissive. Listen, senator, you know, when youre sitting in a subcommittee, just blowing hot air about this, you can say things like that, he said. Paul was also the most aggressive in taking on Trump, challenging him early on his refusal to commit to supporting the party nominee. Hes already hedging his bets because hes used to buying politicians, Paul said. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the youngest candidate in the field at age 44, has tried to carve out a niche as a foreign policy authority, but has struggled to break through this summer  particularly since Trumps surge. He said the election cannot be a resume competition. This election better be about the future, not the past, he said. Rounding out the field was Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, surgeon and tea party favorite Ben Carson and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. The crowded field meant limited talking time for candidates, many of whom were introducing themselves to Americans for the first time. I wasnt sure I was going to get to talk again, Carson quipped when the moderators came back to him at one point. The remaining seven candidates were relegated to a pre-debate forum, a low-key event in a largely empty arena, where candidates avoided debating each other and largely stuck to scripted responses on domestic and foreign policy. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and businesswoman Carly Fiorina opened the early event with biting criticisms of Trump. Perry  whose failed 2012 White House campaign was damaged by an embarrassing debate stumble  accused Trump of using his celebrity rather than his conservatism to fuel his run for president. Fiorina, the only woman in the GOP field, said that Trump had tapped into Americans anger with Washington, but she challenged the businessman as lacking policy positions. What are the principles by which he would govern? she asked. While the candidates pitched their visions for the Republican Partys future, they also made the case that they would present the strongest general election challenge to Clinton. Clinton, in Los Angeles, said in Los Angeles shes often left in a state of disbelief by what she hears from some of her 2016 rivals. Thursdays debate was the first of six party-sanctioned forums scheduled before primary voting begins in February.

{"Content": "[ COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP)  In any other year, a pair of speeches by Vice President Joe Biden on transportation and sexual assault would raise few eyebrows in the political world. This isnt any other year. Bidens visits to Ohio and Michigan on Thursday were closely watched for signs hes gauging his support in two states that typically play a key role in electing the next president. As he considers making a late entrance into the 2016 presidential race, his usual vice presidential appearances have taken on the air of campaign stops, with supporters cheering for him to run. The vice president didnt tip his hand at either stop, eschewing talk of the presidential race for wonkier discourse about infrastructure upgrades and economic development. The closest to a reminder of the political speculation swirling around him came, ironically, at an event in Columbus on the scourge of sexual violence on American college campuses. At Ohio State University  where President Barack Obama kicked off his victorious re-election campaign three years ago  more than a thousand students packed into a gymnasium and chanted Joe, Joe, Joe as they waited for Biden to take the stage. When he did, he was met with thunderous cheers as he saluted students and showed off his scarlet tie evoking the schools official colors. He got a bit of celebrity boost, too, from Hunger Games star Josh Hutcherson, who flew from Los Angeles with Biden aboard Air Force Two to attend the rally. Every single woman on the plane all of a sudden had no interest in talking to me, the vice president quipped. The sprawling public university of more than 60,000 students announced new steps to prevent sexual violence, including mandatory awareness training for all freshmen starting next year. The school plans to dedicate a team to investigating allegations of sexual misconduct and to partner with a local sexual assault hotline. Biden told the students it was never appropriate to ask a domestic violence victim what she said or did that led to being victimized. The question we as a nation have we to ask is what made him think he had a right to raise his hand, Biden said, his voice rising to a roar. Its a theme resonating in this years Democratic presidential primary. Earlier this week in Iowa, Hillary Rodham Clinton put forth her plan to try to end sexual assault on campuses. Like the rally at Ohio State, Bidens visit to Detroit tapped into an issue that has long been central to Bidens identity as a political leader  and could play an equally important role in his message to voters should he choose to run for president. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan joined Biden at the citys transportation headquarters, where the vice president got behind the wheel of one of the citys new hybrid and clean diesel buses, purchased with help from federal grants. Standing in front of the extra-long bus with a city driver, Biden said hed once been a school bus driver  but wasnt sure he could handle one like this. This is cool, man, said the vice president. Ohio and Michigan are among a handful of states that are competitive for Democrats and Republicans, although Michigan has trended Democratic in recent presidential elections. Obama won both in 2008 and 2012. The vice president has been deeply immersed in deliberations with his family and advisers about whether to enter the 2016 race. In recent days, Biden has described his lingering doubts about whether he has the emotional strength to mount a viable campaign just months after his sons death. Hes also started to speak out more directly against the Republican candidates he would face if he won the nomination. After denouncing front-runner Donald Trump on Tuesday for promoting a sick anti-immigrant message, Biden mocked Republicans who question global warming during a visit to California. I think if you pushed them, theyd probably deny gravity as well, he said.

{"Content": "[ Costco Wholesale seems to lean to the Democratic side: Co-founders Jeff Brotman and Jim Sinegal held fundraisers for President   Obama at their Eastside homes, and the company was hailed by the Obama administration as the paragon of American capitalism with a conscience. Costco leaders also have prominently backed the presidents efforts to raise the federal minimum wage. So its interesting to see a Costco board member, Dr. Ben Carson, emerge as one of the most strident and controversial voices against Obama  and the great hope of some Republicans for the 2016 presidential election. Last month Carson ran a very close second to Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas in a straw poll at the Republican Leadership Conference in New Orleans. Hearing the retired neurosurgeon and 15-year Costco director rail against gay marriage or Obamacare  in October he called the health-insurance package the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery, according to The Washington Post  suggests the companys board better leave politics at the door when meeting to discuss the business. Many other Costco directors are clearly not in Carsons corner. Former Yahoo President Susan Decker contributed to the Obama campaign in 2008 and to Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2007, according to campaign-finance website Opensecrets.org. Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti gave money not only to Obamas campaign in 2012, but to Bill Bradleys in 1999. Likewise, former Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation head Jeff Raikes is mostly Democratic in his political contributions; and Warren Buffetts right-hand man, Charles Munger, has been a vocal supporter of raising both the minimum wage and   taxes on the wealthy. Representing the other side of the political aisle, to some extent, is former Washington governor and U.S. Sen. Daniel Evans, a moderate Republican in his day. Costco CFO Galanti referred a request for comment on Carson to CEO Craig Jelinek and former CEO Sinegal, who did not respond. But whatever the political differences, they arent keeping Carsons latest book, One Nation out of Costco warehouses. About 80 percent carry it, said Galanti. The book is No. 1 on The New York Times nonfiction best-seller list. His ongoing book tour included a stop at a Costco in Naples, Fla. Carson rose from poverty in Detroit to become a respected neurosurgeon, and for years led the pediatric neurosurgery center at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. His retirement last year, a few months after a widely followed speech touting conservative values at the National Prayer Breakfast, fed speculation that he might make a run for the presidency. A committee encouraging Carson to run for president was formed last August, and has raised $3.9 million, according to the Federal Election Commission. A message on Carsons website says hes fully aware of the efforts to draft him as presidential candidate, and he doesnt endorse them. As of today it is not my intention to seek public office, it says, but if God has other plans for me moving forward, I am certain he will make those clear and I will always listen.  ngel Gonzlez: agonzalez@seattletimes.com,  ngel Gonzlez: agonzalez@seattletimes.com, , , Auditors tepid take on Baristas Coffee, Baristas Coffee is in the process of rewriting its financial history  and the new version is far less rosy. The Kent-based company, which trades over the counter but has loudly proclaimed plans to get listed on the Nasdaq, touts itself as the fastest-growing drive-through espresso company in the country. Its primary appeal is the female baristas who wear appealing costume-themed attire, which is MBA-speak for scantily clad. This past week, in pursuit of that potential Nasdaq listing, Baristas published its first quarterly financial statement approved by an auditor. That report sharply revises  or overturns  the companys previous account of how it fared in last years first quarter. In its previous, unaudited statement for the quarter ending in March 2013, Baristas reported a $38,440 profit. Now the audited version says that the year-ago quarter actually had a $277,730 loss. None of the key numbers match: Previously reported sales of $433,858 morphed into $366,673, a  15 percent drop. Personnel costs rose to $152,254 from $114,415. General and administration expenses, previously shown as $54,510, in fact amounted to $200,078, the audited report says. As for the latest quarter, ending March 2014, the company reported its loss  narrowed to $51,319. But its financial health is not a pretty picture. Audited sales shrank to $318,246 from the year-ago $366,673. And Baristas reported a mere    $5,799 in cash and no other current assets (although it reports $2.9 million in intangible assets, which is how companies refer to brand recognition and other fuzzy attributes). The company had $927,369 in total liabilities. Asked about the stark difference between the audited and unaudited books, CEO Barry Henthorn said sales in the audited report were lower because they omitted amounts that were not backed up by daily sales records. Also, general and administrative expenses rose to reflect stock-based compensation in 2013 that was not previously recognized. Baristas will be filing amended audited financial reports for the years 2012 and 2013 in the next week. Henthorn said he doesnt expect any significant stock-based compensation or additional cleanup of historical data in the future. ngel Gonzlez: agonzalez@seattletimes.com, ngel Gonzlez: agonzalez@seattletimes.com, , Online eyewear seller Rivet & Sway closes, After two years of encouraging women to accessorize with eyeglasses and sunglasses of all shapes, colors and sizes, just like they would with handbags and scarves, online eyewear startup Rivet & Sway has closed. The Seattle company allowed customers to order multiple pairs and return any they did not like. And even though the company was growing quickly, with sales up 350percent in 2013, the cost of shipping glasses both ways was too much, CEO Sarah Bryar said. We were losing money on every sale, which is not atypical for a startup, said Bryar, who would not disclose the companys revenues. We had made a ton of progress, but it just wasnt enough  We just didnt drive enough growth. Tech news website Geekwire, which first reported the closure, said Rivet and Sways total funding was $3.3 million. Bryar said the last three months were difficult. She tried to persuade investors that with just a couple million dollars more to add a retail store she could bring in more customers, making the difference on profitability, but we just sort of ran out of time to prove that model. Rivet & Sway had began to dabble in adding a physical presence last year with tricycle carts and pop-up-shop events around Seattle.  But Bryar said she didnt pivot fast enough on the idea of a retail space, which she said its much bigger competitor Warby Parker is now also doing. The future of eyewear is really going to be a combination of online and offline, she said. Interaction with a customer in a retail space  Even if they do not come back to your physical store, theyll return to your website. The business had grown to 14 employees, who will stay on for the next two weeks while the company has a blowout sale at its Pioneer Square showroom. Frames and sunglasses are on sale for $49, down from the $169 they were running this year. It is so bittersweet, Bryar said. Raising capital was my single responsibility and I feel responsible for the fate of the company  I just have a mixture of sadness and disappointment, but it is rounded out with a great sense of pride in what we had accomplished.

{"Content": "[ DAVENPORT, Iowa (AP)  Former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley entered the Democratic presidential race on Saturday in a longshot challenge to Hillary Rodham Clinton for the 2016 nomination, casting himself as a new generation leader who would rebuild the economy and reform Wall Street. Im running for you, he told a crowd of about 1,000 people in a populist message at Federal Hill Park in Baltimore, where he served as mayor before two terms as governor. OMalley said was drawn into the campaign to rebuild the truth of the American dream for all Americans. Following his announcement, OMalley promptly headed to Iowa, where he is seeking to become the primary alternative to Clinton in the leadoff caucus state. Before more than fifty people at a union hall in Davenport, he touted his executive experience and called for economic reforms, drawing enthusiastic applause. We are still in just as grave a danger of having Wall Street excesses wreck our economy again and theres not a need for it. When wealth concentrates as it has, it also concentrates and collects power and we have to retake control of our own government, said OMalley, who has made frequent visits to Iowa in recent months. OMalley, who will appear in New Hampshire Sunday, remains largely unknown in a field dominated by Clinton. Already in the race is Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who could be OMalleys main rival for the support of the Democratic left. An ally of former President Bill Clinton, OMalley was the second governor to endorse Hillary Clintons presidential campaign in 2007. But he made clear that he thinks Democrats deserve a choice in the 2016 primary. The presidency is not a crown to be passed back and forth  between two royal families, OMalley said. It is a sacred trust to be earned from the people of the United States, and exercised on behalf of the people of the United States. He pointed to recent news reports that Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein would be fine with either Clinton or former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a leading Republican contender and the son and brother of presidents, in the White House. It was a forceful message that OMalley will focus on overhauling the financial system, a priority for liberals opposed to the bailouts of Wall Street banks. Tell me how it is, that not a single Wall Street CEO was convicted of a crime related to the 2008 economic meltdown? Not a single one, OMalley said. Tell me how it is, that you can get pulled over for a broken tail light, but if you wreck the nations economy you are untouchable?, Aides said OMalley called Hillary Clinton on Friday to tell her he was running. By Saturday afternoon, Clinton had tweeted, Welcome to the race, Gov. OMalley. Looking forward to discussing strong families and communities. The 52-year-old OMalley has spoken often about the economic challenges facing the nation and said he would bring new leadership, progressive values and the ability to accomplish things. We are allowing our land of opportunity to be turned into a land of inequality, he told the crowd. OMalley has presented himself to voters as a next-generation figure in the party, pointing to his record as governor on issues such as gay marriage, immigration, economic issues and the death penalty. His tenure was marked by financial challenges posed by the recession, but OMalley pushed through an increase in the states minimum wage while keeping record amounts of money flowing into the states education system. He backed a bill to allow same-sex marriage, which lawmakers passed and voters approved in 2012. He oversaw a sweeping gun-control measure and a repeal of the death penalty. He also raised taxes on multiple occasions  on higher earners, sales of goods, vehicle titles, gasoline, cigarettes, sewer services and more. Republican critics branded him as a tax-and-spend liberal and the GOP defeated OMalleys hand-picked successor in 2014. But his record on criminal justice has been scrutinized in recent weeks after riots in Baltimore broke out following the death of Freddie Gray, an African-American man who died in police custody following his arrest last month. OMalley was known for his tough-on-crime, zero tolerance policies that led to large numbers of arrests for minor offenses. Critics say it sowed distrust between police and the black community. Supporters note the overall decrease in violent crime during his tenure. OMalley has defended his work to curb crime, saying he helped address rampant violence and drug abuse. A few demonstrators gathered near the park to protest OMalleys criminal justice policies as mayor, an office he held from 1999 until his election as governor in 2006. During OMalleys speech, there was sporadic shouting from protesters, including one who blew a whistle. OMalley called the unrest heartbreaking but said there is something to be learned from that night, and there is something to be offered to our country from those flames. For what took place here was not only about race, not only about policing in America. Its about everything it is supposed to mean to be an American. Megan Kenny, 38, of Baltimore, who held a sign that said stop killer cops and yelled black lives matter, said she thought OMalleys decision to run was a strange choice, especially because of the recent rioting. She attributed the unrest to his ineffective zero-tolerance policy. OMalley could soon be joined in the Democratic field by former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee, who plans to make an announcement next week, and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, who is exploring a potential campaign. Sanders has raised more than $4 million since opening his campaign in late April and sought to build support among liberals in the party who are disillusioned with Clinton. In a sign of his daunting task, Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski, his former boss and mentor, is supporting Clinton. She said in a statement that OMalley should follow his dreams. And while Ive already announced my support for Hillary Clinton, I know that competition is good for democracy. In Iowa, 55-year-old Democratic activist Sara Riley, of Cedar Rapids, said she would support OMalley if Vice President Joe Biden does not run. He can win Iowa, she said of OMalley, noting the state provides opportunities for underdog candidates. Still, she said: Im not going to pretend its easy. ", "Date": "20150530", "Title": "[Former Md.

{"Content": "[ Democrats are laying the groundwork for an ambitious reorganization of their struggling network of super PACs that would exploit the loopholes and legal gray areas Republicans have used to raise hundreds of millions of dollars for the 2016 campaign through such groups. The plans, laid out by the partys top election lawyers in an emergency request filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) on Friday, would pave the way for the creation of a host of new super PACs tailored to individual House and Senate candidates.  But the filing also suggests that Democrats would, if allowed, seek to use tactics pioneered by Republican presidential candidates this cycle, helping prospective candidates establish and raise money for super PACs before they officially declare their intent to run. Most strikingly, the lawyers are asking the FEC to clarify how declared candidates, their campaign staff, and their volunteers can help court donors for independent super PACs. The commissions answer could have profound ramifications for the 2016 campaign. In seeking the commissions guidance, Democrats contend that most of the activities their request describes  like having a candidate pretend to test the waters of a candidacy while raising money  appear to violate the law. But if federal regulators determine such practices are legal, the lawyers wrote, Democratic candidates up and down the ballot are prepared to adopt these tactics. The legal questions at hand, according to the emergency request, are highly significant and time-sensitive. Democratic groups, the lawyers wrote, cannot cede strategic advantage to their political competitors. The lawyers signing the request work at Perkins Coie, the marquee Democratic election firm, which also represents the partys congressional campaign committees, the presidential campaign of Hillary Rodham Clinton and a Democratic super PAC supporting her. The FEC has not yet acted on an array of legal challenges and complaints filed by watchdog groups over the activities of presidential campaigns and their super PACs. And while independent groups are an ever-growing portion of election spending, the commission has been unable to agree on comprehensive new rules for the groups, which arose after the Supreme Courts Citizens United decision in 2010. Democrats have generally called for tighter restrictions on super PACs, seeking new rules legislatively and even going to court to force the commission to act. But the new request takes a different tack: In effect, the lawyers are arguing, the commissions inaction threatens to put Democrats at a competitive disadvantage. If the commissioners agree, they could issue an advisory opinion within 30 days. While such opinions are tailored to the candidate or group requesting them and do not carry the force of regulation, they often act as legal guideposts. If the commission bans some or all of the activities, much of the Republican presidential field could face legal risk. Approval, on the other hand, could lead to an expansion of super PACs in the Democratic Party. Im somewhat skeptical of the Democratic Partys motives, said Lawrence Noble, a senior counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, which has sought FEC sanctions against a group of 2016 candidates for alleged campaign violations.  Theyre probably trying a combination  to embarrass the Republicans and also to have an excuse for doing it themselves, he said. Should the commission deadlock on the request by refusing to act on it or splitting in a 3-3 vote, Noble said, most of the aggressive lawyers will say it gives them a green light to engage in similar tactics. Republican super PACs have raised or committed hundreds of millions of dollars in the 2016 election cycle, in part by tightening their relationships with candidates, whose personal ties to donors can pave the way for rapid fundraising by the groups. All told, they have raised many times more money than Democratic groups, though Republicans are also likely to burn through more super PAC cash during the nominating battles ahead.]", "Date": "20150914", "Title": "[Democrats seek to expand super PAC use]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation-politics/democrats-seek-to-expand-super-pac-use/", "Author": "[NICHOLAS CONFESSORE]"}
{"Content": "[ Divided House Democrats are weighing whether to participate in a new investigation of the deadly attack in Benghazi, Libya, or boycott the election-year inquiry of a tragedy they accuse Republicans of politicizing. Party leaders will meet with rank-and-file members Friday to decide the next step after Republicans the day before rammed through a resolution creating a special select committee to examine the Sept. 11, 2012, assault. Four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, were killed when militants stormed the diplomatic outpost. The vote Thursday to create the special committee was 232-186. Seven Democrats, many of whom face tough re-elections in November, broke ranks and joined the GOP majority. The panels investigation will be the eighth on Benghazi and means high-profile hearings in the months leading up to the elections, with Republicans grilling current and former Obama administration officials. Certain to be called to testify is former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democrats potential 2016 presidential candidate. Democrats are split over whether to boycott the select committee, which will have a 7-5 Republican edge in membership. They are concerned that their participation would grant legitimacy to what they believe will be a partisan forum. But they also worry that if they avoid it they wont have the chance to counter GOP claims and defend potential witnesses. This doesnt need to be, shouldnt be and will not be a partisan process, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a speech on the House floor promising pursuit of the truth. Democrats have their doubts, Its hard to trust what Speaker Boehner is doing with this new select committee, Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif. chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said in a statement after the vote. He pointed to Boehners comments a month ago that a special panel was unnecessary. After the vote, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. was noncommittal about whether Democrats would participate on the special committee, but assailed the new probe. Our nation deserves better than yet another deeply partisan and political review, she said. Boehners legislation creates the special committee through the end of the year. It will have to be reapproved when a new Congress begins in January or go out of existence. The select committee has no explicit financial constraints. The speaker was expected to announce the Republican members on Friday. House Democrats have issued several demands if they are to participate in the select committee. Rebuffed on their request for an equal split in membership, Democrats are seeking guarantees theyll have equal access to documents, say on subpoenas and the right to question witnesses. In the 20 months since the attack, multiple independent, bipartisan and GOP-led probes already have faulted the State Department for inadequate security at the outpost, leading to four demotions. No attacker has yet been brought to justice. Republicans say theyre unsatisfied with explanations so far, and they have leveled a range of accusations against President Barack Obama, Clinton and other senior administration officials. Chief among them is that the administration misled the American people about the nature of the attack during a presidential election campaign and stonewalled congressional investigators. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla. criticized the song and dance she said came from Clinton when House members wanted to question her about Benghazi a few months after the attack. Clintons testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee was delayed when she missed a month of work toward the end of her tenure after suffering a virus, then a fall and a concussion, and then brief hospitalization for a blood clot near her brain. Benghazi has produced 13 public hearings, the release of 25,000 pages of documents and 50 separate briefings. The select committee wont be the only inquiry, as other GOP-led congressional panels continue their investigations, including a House Oversight probe which just last week took the extraordinary step of subpoenaing a Cabinet member, Secretary of State John Kerry. Kerry hasnt said when he might testify. Democrats deride the effort as a conservative campaign designed to energize Republican voters in typically low-turnout midterm elections. Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va. accused Republicans of perpetuating myths and conspiracies and remaining obsessed with recycling tired and worn talking points in a cynical attempt to fire up the GOP base in the run-up to an election year. Earlier this week, the National Republican Congressional Committee sent an email vowing that no one will get away from the committees investigation and asking people for donations. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C. the former prosecutor tapped by Boehner to head the panel, has signaled he would re-examine the entirety of the Benghazi attack, including questions Democrats and some senior Republicans consider settled. Some Democrats dismiss the notion that the public will pay attention. I think the American people are not interested in Benghazi, said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. It appeals to the narrow base of the Republican Party.

{"Content": "[ Donald Trump, as expected, made headlines at the Republican presidential debate last week. Less dramatic, but more profound, observers believe, was that Facebook co-sponsored the event with Fox News. The social networks high-profile participation spotlights a trend that has been building for years: the ascendancy of social media in electoral politics and the decreasing relevance of traditional television. Videos of Trump dissing people including Rosie ODonnell and his fellow candidates while calling politicians stupid quickly spread to millions of Facebook users and other social channels online, foreshadowing social medias critical role in the long road to Election Day. As the campaign season builds momentum, those posts will be accompanied by paid political video advertising, providing a healthy boost to the bottom line at Facebook, Snapchat and other social networks that stand to benefit from the new trend in campaign spending. It is becoming increasingly difficult for campaigns and political advertisers to reach audiences through traditional methods, said Brian Donahue, chief executive of Craft Media/Digital, a Washington, D.C. agency that does traditional and digital advertising for political campaigns. Social medias importance to political campaigning isnt new. Then-Sen. Barack Obama famously leveraged Facebook to help him win the presidency in 2008. About a third of a million more people showed up at the ballot box in the U.S. in 2010 after seeing a get out the vote message at the top of their news feed on Election Day, according to a University of California, San Diego-led study. But social media are becoming even more influential. Social networks have ballooned since the last presidential election. Candidates are smarter about using them. The platforms are almost ubiquitous among millennials, a group pundits believe could be key to winning the election. And as the use of online video has exploded, campaigners are beginning to combine the targeting power of rich data analytics with videos attention-getting emotional appeal, creating a hybrid form of campaigning tailor-made for the digital age. Many candidates are using the medium to project a more relatable image than what they put out over television ads. With social networks such as Facebook, Campaigns can reach the right slice of voters at the right time with the right message to direct the right outcome, Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said. The Menlo Park, Calif. company doesnt release campaign-ad spending figures. Traditional television-ad spending will remain dominant  a record 24 million viewers tuned in for the debate  but its centrality has begun to wane. These days candidates are allotting more ad dollars than ever to digital platforms. Online political spending is estimated to reach more than $1 billion in 2016, according to Borrell Associates, a research firm that monitors ad spending. In 2012, that figure was $159 million. An entire wall of TVs blasting candidate-approved messages wont hold back the digital tsunami forever, said Corey Elliott, director of research at Borrell. In 2016, broadcast TV will still get about 1 out of every 2 political ad dollars, but by 2020, it will drop to almost 1 out of 3. Thursdays debate played out in a huge way on Facebook. The companys logo was predominantly displayed throughout the debate. More than 40,000 people responded via Facebook to Fox News call for candidate questions, and 7.5 million Facebook users in the U.S. made 20 million interactions in the form of posts, shares, likes and comments about the debate. Facebook is reasserting itself as the place where dialogue happens, said Jason Cieslak, Pacific Rim president at global-branding company Siegel + Gale. Rival social networks are also jostling to be part of the election conversation. This year, Snapchat hired Googles U.S. politics ad-sales lead Rob Saliterman to make inroads with the political-advertising community. The app on Thursday ran a handful of political ads, including one by a PAC supporting Ohio Gov. John Kasich and another from billionaire Tom Steyers NextGen Climate Action Committee. The Venice, Calif. startup also compiled a mix of photos and videos into a six-minute feature that included the landing of a plane with Trump emblazoned on it, Kasich eating a steak before the debate and sound bites from candidate interviews. Snapchat said it didnt have viewership figures but tells advertisers that eight times more people age 13 to 34 in the U.S. view Snapchats overview of big events than watch similar programming on TV. Twitters government team has begun briefing candidates campaigns and political groups on how to use new tools to engage with specific audiences. One of these is the Tailored Audiences feature, which allows candidates to tailor tweets to specific ZIP codes, ages, genders and other demographic information, spokesman Nick Pacilio said.]", "Date": "20150808", "Title": "[Social medias role in elections is growing]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/social-medias-role-in-elections-is-growing/", "Author": "[Andrea Chang, Samantha Masunaga]"}
{"Content": "[ During the depths of the economic crises that consumed his first term, President Barack Obama helped pluck a Harvard professor named Elizabeth Warren out of relative obscurity and made her the face of his campaign to curtail Wall Street banks. Now Warren, who parlayed that platform into a Senate seat from Massachusetts, is showing a willingness to take a stand against Obama, magnifying rifts in the Democratic Party and sparking speculation about her own presidential ambitions. Despite their shared history, Warren and the White House have a political incentive in using each other as a foil. For Obama, creating distance with Warren may be seen as a tack to the center that clears the way for striking deals with Republicans, which is likely to be the only way he can rack up legislative achievements during his final two years in office. Next month, the GOP will hold a commanding majority in the House and a comfortable edge in the Senate. For Warren, splitting with the president, particularly on economic issues, helps solidify her as a populist champion and perhaps opens a lane for challenging expected Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton. We are in a moment on economic inequality and that is the defining fight of Elizabeth Warrens life, said Anna Galland, executive director of the progressive group MoveOn.org, which has launched a $1 million effort to draft Warren for the 2016 campaign. Warren has repeatedly shot down speculation of a White House run. In an interview with NPR that aired Monday, she said, I am not running for president  but pointedly avoided answering whether she was also ruling out running for president in the future. The draft Warren campaign has picked up momentum following her high-profile split with Obama last week over a $1.1 trillion spending bill to keep the government funded through Sept. 30. Warren balked at a provision that weakened regulations on complex financial instruments known as derivatives that were included in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation. Warren blasted the measure as a deal negotiated behind closed doors that slips in a provision that would let derivatives traders on Wall Street gamble with taxpayer money and get bailed out by the government when their risky bets threaten to blow up our financial system. Despite her opposition, the legislation passed the House and Senate. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Democrats second-ranking Senate leader, said the White House retains trust in Warren, and he doesnt worry about her fracturing the party. A party has to have a soul, Durbin said in an interview Monday. And I think what she is speaking to are the progressive issues. And I happen to agree with her thinking. A senior White House official described the split with Warren as more of a tactical disagreement than an ideological divide. Obama also opposed rolling back the bank regulation, but calculated that protecting the measure wasnt worth risking a government shutdown. Warren spent most of her career in academia, studying bankruptcy and middle class financial issues. Shortly after Obamas election in 2008, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid appointed her to chair a congressional panel created to oversee the massive bank bailout known as TARP. As Obama pressed Congress to pass financial reform legislation, he fought to include the creation of a consumer financial protection agency, a concept Warren is considered the architect of. After the Dodd-Frank bill passed, Obama brought Warren into his administration to help set up the consumer agency. Obama had hoped to nominate Warren as the agencys first director, but changed plans after it became clear Republicans would block her confirmation. Warren handily won a Senate seat in Massachusetts in 2012 and has at times been candid in calling out the White House. When asked about the president in an interview this fall with Salon, she said that when the going got tough, his economic team picked Wall Street. She also opposes Obamas pick of banker Antonio Weiss to fill the top Treasury job, saying the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington must stop. Warren has calibrated her criticisms of the Obama administration, avoiding personal attacks. Still, she makes her points in spirited speeches, such as one she made from the Senate floor late Friday. The American people are disgusted by Wall Street bailouts, she said. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina spoke next, and warned Democrats that Warren would lead them down a treacherous path. Blocking the compromise spending bill, Graham said, would prove as unpopular now as the GOP-driven government shutdown was in 2013. Dont follow her lead, Graham said. Shes the problem. It may be tempting to go down the road of least resistance, but you will regret it. It hurt my party. It will hurt yours.

{"Content": "[ El Nio is coming. Above-average sea surface temperatures have developed off the west coast of South America and seem poised to grow into a full-fledged El Nio event, in which unusually warm water spreads across the equatorial East Pacific. Models indicate a 75 percent chance of an El Nio this fall, which could bring devastating droughts to Australia or heavy rains to the U.S. South. The debate about climate change, however, brings additional significance to this round of El Nio, which will probably increase global temperatures, perhaps to the highest levels ever. It could even inaugurate a new era of more rapid warming, offering vindication to maligned climate models and re-energizing climate activists who have struggled to break through in a polarized political environment. For a decade, climate scientists have battled a public-relations challenge: Even though atmospheric temperatures are higher than at any time in the past 4,000 years, surface-temperature increases seem to have slowed down since 1998. The planet has grown warmer in the past decade, but climate-change skeptics have used this so-called hiatus or pause in warming to take aim at the accuracy of the climate models, which appeared to predict more significant warming than has so far happened. Most climate scientists argue that the climate models have never predicted steady, uninterrupted warming. Annual global temperatures always rise and fall on either side of the longer-term average, they say, in much the same way stocks rise and fall from day to day, even during a strong market.  They believe, based on computer simulations of hiatus periods and measurements from new floating sensors, that they can account for the missing heat, much of which they believe is deep in the ocean, more than 700 meters below the waters surface. Nonetheless, the hiatus helped climate-change skeptics earn mainstream adherents last year as global temperatures hung perilously close to falling beneath even the lowest model projections. Apocalypse perhaps a little later, as The Economist put it. It is hard to assess how much the hiatus has undermined the publics confidence in climate science. There is some evidence that the number of Americans who dont believe in global warming has increased by about 7 percentage points since the hiatus began to gain mainstream news-media attention, according to Edward Maibach, the director of the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University. In any case, its impossible to know how much the public would have been swayed by more significant temperature increases. One thing that is clear is that climate scientists have struggled to communicate the complexities of the climate system. But this years El Nio might represent a turning point. The oscillation between El Nio and La Nia, El Nios cold-water cousin, is part of the reason for slower atmospheric warming. Sea surface temperatures in the Pacific rise during El Nio and ultimately heat up the atmosphere in what Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, calls a mini global-warming event. The reverse happens during La Nia. The shifts between El Nio and La Nia offer an elegant explanation for some or perhaps most of the slowdown in atmospheric warming. The hiatus is said to have begun in 1998, just after the historic El Nio of 1997 and early 1998. La Nia has often prevailed since then, cooling the atmosphere. But if this falls El Nio event is strong and long enough, Trenberth believes it is reasonable to expect that 2015 will be the warmest year on record. That could make a difference in the battle for public opinion. One-third of Americans do not trust climate scientists, according to Jon Krosnick of Stanford University, and form their views about climate change based on very recent trends in warming. Belief in warming jumps when global temperatures hit record highs; it drops in cooler years. As El Nio returns heat from the oceans to the atmosphere, the ensuing spike in global surface temperatures could earn considerable media attention, especially if record-setting global temperatures coincide with extreme weather events typically brought by El Nio. But El Nio has the potential to do more than offer a one-time jolt to climate activists. It could unleash a new wave of warming that could shape the debate for a decade or longer. In this chain of events, a strong El Nio would cause a shift in a longer cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which favors more frequent and intense El Nios during its warm or positive phase. The oscillation has been negative or cool since the historic El Nio of 1998. Climate scientists do not fully understand the mechanics of this phenomenon. But the suspicion is certainly that it is related to El Nio events, Trenberth said. The switch to the current negative phase was probably triggered by the 97-98 El Nio. The question is whether this falls El Nio might kick the PDO into a positive phase, he said. If it does, a result would be faster warming, at least doubling the rate of surface temperature increases. A sustained period of faster warming will not convert skeptics into climate-change activists. But the accompanying wave of headlines might energize climate-change activists and refocus attention on climate change heading into the 2016 presidential election. The timing could be uncomfortable for Republican presidential hopefuls who are skeptical of climate change, like Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who recently said he did not believe human activity was causing climate change. Democrats, eager to cast Republicans as anti-science or to appeal to voters in the endangered coastal city of Miami, might be likelier to re-emphasize climate change if polls show an increase in the publics belief in global warming, which Krosnick anticipates will happen if global temperatures rise to record levels. Even so, Krosnick doubts whether higher temperatures would compel more ambitious measures to curb carbon emissions. It wont vastly increase pressure on the government to do something. Mark McKinnon, a Republican strategist, thinks recurring catastrophic events will be necessary to soften the GOPs position on climate change. Without Republican support, it will be hard for Congress to pass climate legislation.]", "Date": "20140519", "Title": "[How El Nio may change the political climate]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/how-el-nio-may-change-the-political-climate/", "Author": "[NATE COHN]"}
{"Content": "[ Ellen OShea, an organic farmer from Chimacum, Jefferson County, had planned to share a car and ferry ride with a couple friends to see Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Saturday in Seattle. But so many Olympic Peninsula neighbors were fired up to see the independent Vermont senator, they chartered what theyre dubbing the Freedom Bus for as many as 60 to get into the city. With a socialist City Council member, $15 minimum wage and a statue of Lenin, Seattle is friendly territory for a candidate like Sanders  and organizers expect thousands from across the state will pack two events: a 1 p.m. Social Security event at Westlake Park and a 6 p.m. campaign rally at Edmundson Pavilion. As the first 2016 contender to publicly campaign in Washington, Sanders visit contrasts with recent secretive stopovers by other candidates. Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton and Republican Jeb Bush each slipped into the Seattle area this year to mingle at penthouses and mansions with donors who paid thousands of dollars to attend. Sanders only scheduled fundraiser is a small, $200-a-person meet-and-greet at Capitol Hills Comet Tavern. An avowed socialist whod be the oldest president ever elected in the U.S. Sanders faces steep obstacles to winning the Democratic nomination compared to Clinton, who has led in polls and fundraising. But Sanders fiery, anti-corporate rhetoric, tinged with the Brooklyn accent of his youth, has attracted progressive Democrats dissatisfied with their partys presumed front-runner. I think there is growing unhappiness with establishment politics, with politics that just nibbles around the edges of issues, Sanders said Thursday during a conference call with local reporters when asked what distinguishes him from Clinton. There will not be any significant change to the middle class of this country unless we have a mass political movement taking on the billionaire class, he added. He also pointed to his clear opposition to free-trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and to his support for a national $15 minimum wage like the one in Seattle. A former mayor of Burlington, Vt. Sanders was elected as an independent to the U.S. Senate in 2006 after serving 16 years as the states sole U.S. House representative. If he were to win, Sanders, 73, would be the oldest U.S. president ever inaugurated. To many local supporters, the long track record is a comfort. No matter how far back you go, hes always said the same thing, said Mario Brown, of Edmonds, one of the organizers of Washington For Bernie Sanders, an unofficial volunteer group. Several Sanders supporters said theyd jumped early in 2008 onto the candidacy of the charismatic but little known Sen. Barack Obama. They helped him to outorganize and beat Clinton  only to be disappointed when they felt his presidency failed to live up to the lofty campaign speeches and transformative image. I am feeling burned by him, OShea said. She doesnt think that would happen with Sanders, whom she first encountered during an anti-war organizing meeting in the 1970s. Just to be sure hes reliable, OShea said, shes talked with friends in Vermont. After Obama, I dont want to be projecting to anybody that this is a person we can trust without verifying that, OShea said. Sanders rallies in Seattle, which organizers said could draw 10,000 or more, will be followed by events in Portland on Sunday and Los Angeles on Monday. The Portland event was shifted to a bigger venue due to overwhelming demand, his campaign said. A big part of Sanders appeal is his refusal to accept corporate donations, said Joe Rogerson, who plans to drive with a carful of supporters from Bellingham to Seattle Saturday. He said Obama sold out to corporate America and the military-industrial complex but that Sanders seems more trustworthy than any other politician. Sanders said Thursday hed apply a litmus test for any Supreme Court nominees  they must favor overturning the 2010 Citizens United ruling that opened new floodgates for big money in politics. Some pundits and political insiders have questioned Sanders viability as a serious national contender, noting his long identification as a socialist, as well as Clintons massive advantage in fundraising and professional organization. Paul Berendt, former chairman of the state Democratic Party, said Sanders honest voice appeals to many who feel disenfranchised by politics. But Berendt, a Clinton supporter, said he believes the Vermont senators appeal is limited to a subset of mostly white progressives and that he falls flat with a wider electorate, including minority groups that are a big part of the Democratic Partys constituency. Hes going to have a very hard time breaking out of that, Berendt said. Sanders backers here say they dont buy the mainstream narrative that he cannot win. Local organizers point to 200 house parties organized last month that drew thousands of supporters to start planning for how to win Washingtons Democratic caucuses on March 26. David Spring, a Democratic activist from North Bend, said he was involved in Obamas 2008 campaign early, before anyone could even pronounce his name.

{"Content": "[ Even before this months tumultuous ruling quashing charter schools as unconstitutional, the Washington Supreme Court had been a central player in some of the states biggest recent political fights. Last year the court held the state in contempt for inadequate funding of public schools  and it followed up in August with a $100,000-a-day fine. Three years ago, justices struck down a voter-approved measure requiring the Legislature to have a supermajority to enact tax increases. The high-profile rulings generally have been applauded by unions and Democratic-leaning groups, while angering conservatives and some business organizations. AG to justices: Charter-school ruling puts Running Start at risk, Charter-school ruling prompts initiative targeting Supreme Court, The ideological makeup of the court shifted over the past several years, with the departure of its two most conservative members, James Johnson and Richard Sanders, as well as centrist former Chief Justice Gerry Alexander. Critics argue the court has grown more liberal and activist. Defenders say the nine justices are doing their jobs  applying the constitution without regard to popular opinion. While there is widespread disagreement about the courts recent decisions, some common themes emerged in interviews last week with attorneys, former justices, legislators and other court observers. They described a studious and engaged set of judges who ask probing questions of attorneys during oral arguments. But they also see a body that  unlike past courts  includes no former legislators or public officials with deep experience in other branches of government. That means that they have a certain outlook about the judiciary, said former Justice Phil Talmadge, who also served as a Democratic state legislator. Its basically a court that sees itself unrestrained in its authority. Talmadge and others blasted as tone deaf the timing of the charter-school ruling, which came late on the Friday before Labor Day  after some of the fledgling schools had opened. They argued the majority opinion  which held that taxpayer money could go only to schools under the authority of elected local boards, unlike independently run charter schools  is an example of overreach that breaks with a precedent of deference to the Legislature on budget matters. The same, critics noted, could be said of the courts decision to retain active oversight of education budgeting in the McCleary school-funding case. Chief Justice Barbara Madsen, who authored the charter ruling and is one of three justices up for re-election in 2016, declined interview requests for this story, noting through a spokeswoman she cannot comment on ongoing cases. In an emailed statement, Madsen said the court has often been asked to decide difficult constitutional questions, which is the role of a judiciary in a democratic society. The court makes its decisions on the merits, and only (italics hers) the legal merits of each case, she wrote. Hugh Spitzer, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Washington, dismissed complaints of judicial activism. A court is always called activist when it issues a ruling that someone doesnt like, he said. I would say the state Supreme Court tries very hard to get it right in terms of the law. Even if all the members of the court might have been Democrats before they went on the court, Spitzer said they split on rulings all the time  noting the three justices who dissented in the charter-schools case. State Sen. Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, an attorney, argued the court has shown patience. Contrary to some of my Republican colleagues who think this is a massively activist court, I think they have been extremely restrained in their dealing with the McCleary case, Pedersen said. The recent set of decisions has led some Republicans behind the scenes to start mulling whether to recruit challengers for the court. Elections for the high-court seats have grown less competitive in recent years  with spending dominated more by liberal groups. In 2014, when four justices were up for election, two faced no opposition and two had nominal opponents. All the incumbents easily won in relatively light-spending contests. That was in sharp contrast to the mid-2000s when unions battled it out with the states homebuilders association in expensive, bruising contests. In the most recent elections, the builders have basically stood down. I think the court has not been as ideologically uniform as it is today for a long time. It is a court composed of people who are very left of center, argued former Attorney General Rob McKenna, a Republican. Alexander, who retired in 2011, defended the court. He said he considers himself a Republican, though in 2006 he was challenged by a Building Industry Association of Washington (BIAW)-backed conservative candidate in what was the costliest judicial race in state history. He said he never thought partisan identity had much influence on decision-making at the court. The court intellectually is probably as good as its ever been since statehood, Alexander added. He described the nine justices  six women and three men  as a hot court, meaning they tend to ask lots of questions during oral arguments. That was readily apparent in the Oct. 28 oral arguments on charter schools. Paul Lawrence, the attorney for the League of Women Voters of Washington and other plaintiffs, got about a minute into his argument when Justice Debra Stephens jumped in with a question about the parameters of common schools, the term applied by the state constitution to the bulk of public schools. Several observers described Stephens, the first woman from Eastern Washington to serve on the court, as a particularly avid and incisive questioner. Former Justice Sanders called her brilliant. He also pointedly noted the supermajority of women on the court. He didnt explicitly say the women voted together as a bloc. But he said Madsen, in particular, wants to drive the court in a certain direction  one preoccupied with matters of gender equity in the justice system. Madsen chairs the state Gender and Justice Commission, which addresses gender bias in the courts. Sanders also described the women on the court as showing antipathy to guns and gun rights. Jim Johnson would be at the other extreme. He would get up at 4 a.m. to go duck hunting in Aberdeen and show up at 8 to the court. That was something the women on the court couldnt fathom. Even so, Sanders was reluctant to cast the courts decisions in an ideological light, saying each one had to be judged on the merits. Johnson showed no such hesitancy. He compared the court majority to George Wallace standing in front of the charter-school doors  a reference to the legendary segregationist governor standing in a University of Alabama doorway to protest black students enrollment. Some Republicans in Washington state hope the anger brings more competition to the next rounds of judicial races. I think there ought to be, said former Republican U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton, noting hes not personally involved in such efforts. He said a qualified attorney or judge ought to run for the court next year specifically criticizing the charter-schools ruling, which he called an absolute disgrace. Still others are scrutinizing the funding of judicial races. Johnson complained that public-sector unions have become the giants in the room. He himself was targeted by unions during his re-election campaigns. But he had big-money support of his own. As a former lawyer for the BIAW, he benefited from more than $135,000 in support from the builders group during a 2004 re-election campaign. The Washington Education Association (WEA) has been the largest donor to Supreme Court races since 2008, with $21,200 in direct contributions, according to campaign-finance data maintained by the National Institute on Money in State Politics. Seven justices received maximum donations of $1,800 or $1,900 from the WEA during their most recent campaigns. Justice Susan Owens also benefitted from a $50,000 WEA donation to a political-action committee supporting her in 2006. The union was a named plaintiff in the lawsuit to overturn the 2012 charter-schools initiative. In her statement to The Seattle Times, Madsen defended the courts impartiality, pointing to provisions in the state Code of Judicial Conduct that prohibit judges from directly asking for campaign contributions. In practice, Jim Lobsenz, an attorney who has been to judicial fundraisers, said judges leave the room when talk of money begins. Alexander professed he didnt even know who donated in his elections. I just kept myself isolated from that part of the campaign. But some national judicial-reform advocates say Washington could have stricter recusal laws when it comes to cases involving campaign donors. The Washington standard is very subjective. It basically leaves it up to the judge to decide, said Debra Erenberg, director of state affairs for Justice At Stake, a nonpartisan Washington, D.C.-based group that advocates for policies to keep courts impartial. Polling has shown the public loses confidence in court decisions when judges fail to recuse themselves from cases involving substantial donors, Erenberg noted. Some groups have questioned whether it makes sense to elect judges at all. Washington is one of 22 states that choose high-court justices in contested elections, according to the Institute for the Advancement of the American Legal System at the University of Denver. In seven of those states, partisan affiliation of candidates must be indicated on judicial ballots. Thats not the case in Washington, where races are officially nonpartisan. Some state legislators  irked by the Supreme Courts school-funding mandates  proposed a bill this year to make Supreme Court candidates run in partisan races. The bill was mostly backed by Republicans, but also attracted a few Democratic sponsors. Washingtons system of electing judges is contained in the state constitution and so is unlikely to change anytime soon. Talmadge said elections are the proper remedy  as opposed to impeachment threats or other legislative overreactions. I believe in election of judges, he said.

{"Content": "[ Fast-food workers and their union allies plan to take the fight for a $15 minimum wage to Bellevue on Wednesday, the first attempt to expand the movement regionally since the Seattle City Council passed a $15 minimum-wage plan in June. While the prospects for a $15 minimum wage in Bellevue arent known, the city is generally considered more conservative and business-friendly than Seattle. And even in Seattle, supporters say the higher wage wasnt on local politicians radar when fast-food workers first went on strike in May 2013. We think history is moving in the direction of support for workers being able to support themselves and their families,  said Sage Wilson, spokesman for Working Washington, a union-backed organization planning Wednesdays march and rally. Seattle fast-food workers plan to march from a McDonalds on First Hill to a park overlooking Interstate 90, where they will be joined by supporters before marching across the I-90 bridge to Bellevue. The protesters plan to end the day with peaceful civil disobedience to call attention to the number of low-wage workers on the Eastside, Wilson said.  While the median household income in Bellevue is $88,000 a year, union leaders say thousands of workers in retail, fast-food and other service industries make less than $15 an hour and face the same high cost of living as in Seattle. Bellevue is not just a place of prosperity, its also a place of inequality, said Wilson,    noting that about 20 percent of children in the Bellevue School District qualify for free and reduced lunches and about one in six families lives below the federal poverty level. Bellevue leaders say raising the minimum wage hasnt been part of the political conversation there  at least not yet. And many of the political ingredients that led to passage of the Seattle measure arent present on the Eastside. No City Council members are up for election this year, so the issue hasnt come up on the campaign trail. There is no outspoken socialist demanding $15 now (Seattle Councilmember Kshama Sawant), and no mayor has vowed to make the wage a priority, as did Seattle Mayor Ed Murray when he was elected in November. Bellevue Mayor Claudia Balducci said that while her city hasnt taken up a local minimum-wage discussion, she thinks people will be receptive. I believe Bellevue residents will largely be understanding and sympathetic to the idea of fair pay and addressing income inequality. We have not yet had the discussion on what is the most effective way to address these systemic issues, she said.  Patrick Bannon, president of the Bellevue Downtown Association, said the minimum-wage issue hasnt appeared on the City Councils agenda and that business leaders havent been asked to help craft a plan, as they were in Seattle. When Murray was elected in Seattle, the $15 minimum wage seemed to be a foregone conclusion, Bannon said. The BDA hasnt taken it up. If it becomes a priority for members here, its up to our board to decide how or if we engage. The International Franchise Association, which is suing Seattle over the $15 minimum-wage plan, said the Bellevue move represented a union-organizing tactic and not a grass-roots workers effort. The majority of franchisees are not wealthy, theyre struggling just like other independent small businesses, said Matthew Haller, spokesman for the International Franchise Association. And the vast majority of workers in the fast-food industry are making more than minimum wage. Seattles wage ordinance requires franchise owners to reach the higher minimum wage on the same three- or four-year schedule as large businesses, regardless of the number of local employees. Small businesses have up to seven years to reach $15 an hour. The state minimum wage is $9.32 an hour. In its Seattle lawsuit, the franchise association accused SEIU Local 775 President David Rolf and his union of orchestrating the minimum-wage campaign to increase membership and union dues. In an email Tuesday, Rolf said global franchise brands make billions for their shareholders and millions for their CEOs. They do it by promoting a low-wage, part-time business model that impoverishes workers, and concentrates risk and debt on the franchisee  Instead of filing lawsuits, they should adopt a responsible business model that shares their prosperity with all of those who help create it. Nationally, observers of the fight for higher wages say that as cities take the lead, those efforts often spread to surrounding regions. Washington, D.C. and two neighboring counties, Montgomery and Prince Georges, enacted legislation at the same time to raise the minimum wage to $11.50 an hour by 2015, said Tsedeye Gebreselassie, senior staff attorney for the National Employment Law Project. She said Berkeley, Calif. just raised its minimum wage to hit $12.53 an hour by 2016 and Oakland residents will vote in November on a $12.25 minimum wage  both in response to San Franciscos $10.74-an-hour wage, which is also tied to inflation. Where cities have enacted higher minimum wages, it seeds the momentum to raise the minimum wage in surrounding areas, she said. Were now starting to see more regional strategies. Nicole Vallestero Keenan, policy director for Puget Sound Sage who served on Murrays Income Inequality Committee, said the push for a higher minimum wage can be polarizing, as it was in SeaTac. Business and labor spent more than $1 million   on a ballot measure last year to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour for airport-area workers. But she said a citywide effort, such as the one being launched in Bellevue, can also bring together people in thinking about what a fair wage for the region should be.

{"Content": "[ For Bellevue-based T-Mobile USA, a deal with satellite-TV provider Dish Network isnt the only option  and it may not be the best one either. The fourth-largest U.S. wireless carrier has climbed 15 percent since Sprint decided in August to drop its bid for T-Mobile because of regulatory pressure (getting a 1.8 percent boost in the last 10 days on reports that Dish and T-Mobile were in merger talks). Earnings at T-Mobile, a $32 billion company, have gotten better, too, as it gained more subscribers. Because of that, T-Mobiles German parent Deutsche Telekom can command top dollar for what is probably the last major U.S. mobile-phone service provider still obtainable. T-Mobile has outperformed their expectations, thats for sure, said Sergey Dluzhevskiy, an analyst at Gabelli & Co. They are going to be looking for the best possible deal. Charlie Ergen is a tough negotiator, and obviously Deutsche Telekom is not a forced seller. Dish Chief Executive Office Charlie Ergen said in a Bloomberg TV interview that T-Mobile remains a logical merger partner for his $34billion company, but Deutsche Telekom may be in a position where it doesnt want to do a deal. Would Dish and T-Mo be a logical combination? I think it would be. I think that there are certainly a lot of positives to that, if theres willing participants, Ergen said. Theyre obviously controlled by a German company who has strategic initiatives, both in Europe and the United States, and they may not be in a position where they want to do anything. T-Mobile would be on the pricier side for a billionaire dealmaker who isnt known for paying up. Ergen amassed his stockpile of spectrum, or wireless airwaves, mainly through bankruptcy auctions. While he did shell out most of Dishs cash for the latest government sale of bandwidth, he used a loophole to get about $3 billion in discounts. In a sale, T-Mobile  whose stock closed Friday at $39  could probably command about $49 a share, Dluzhevskiy, of Gabelli, said. Another sticking point is that Dish would likely pay for a large portion of any T-Mobile takeover in stock. Deutsche Telekom is concerned that Dish shares are overvalued and the premium investors now assign to its unused spectrum will go away once those airwaves are put to use, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. T-Mobile will eventually need more spectrum to continue growing and a deal with Dish would let it avoid spending billions at government auctions. Thats not a pressing need right now, though, because T-Mobiles customer base is still relatively small and it has ample capacity where it has coverage, Walter Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG, wrote in a June 4 report. At $49 a share, a takeover of T-Mobile would be a $62 billion deal, including debt. Its big, but several billion less than what Comcast was willing to pay for Time Warner Cable. And there are companies in the industry, Comcast included, that might consider the price tag worth it. Buying T-Mobile would help Comcast offer TV, Internet, mobile and wireline service in one package  a quadruple play that peers in Europe have already been moving toward, Dluzhevskiy said. Altice, which was in the running for Time Warner Cable, is more of a longshot buyer. Still, the cable operator has said it wants the U.S. to ultimately account for half of its business and there arent many other big targets available to get it there.

{"Content": "[ For most Republicans, the Supreme Courts ruling on gay marriage is an opportunity to put to rest a divisive issue that threatens their party in the 2016 presidential election. As if dropping a hint to some members of his party, Republican National Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement the Supreme Court has spoken with finality. Yet some Republican candidates are seizing the decision and the controversy as an opportunity. Former Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Sen. Rick Santorum and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal are among the Republican contenders decrying the courts 5-4 ruling and angling to use it as a cudgel against competitors like Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who hasnt stated his position on a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage and probably has a better shot at the nomination. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas is sponsoring such legislation in Congress. I will not acquiesce to an imperial court any more than our Founders acquiesced to an imperial British monarch, Huckabee said in a statement. We must resist and reject judicial tyranny, not retreat. Responses from the 2016 field:, THE DEMOCRATS, Moments after the Supreme Court announced the ruling Hillary Rodham Clinton tweeted out congratulations to LGBT Americans. Today is one of those days well tell all our grandchildren about. . . . This is our country at its best: inclusive, open and striving towards true equality, Clinton said in a statement. Equally quick off the mark was Clinton rival Martin OMalley, who worked in a not-so-subtle reminder that he signed a gay marriage bill into law when he was governor of Maryland. Today, the Supreme Court affirmed that marriage is a human right  not a state right. Im grateful to the people of Maryland for leading the way on this important issue of human dignity and equality under the law. The American Dream is strongest when all are included. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who is seeking the Democratic nomination, was equally emphatic: Today the Supreme Court fulfilled the words engraved upon its building: Equal justice under law. This decision is a victory for same-sex couples across our country as well as all those seeking to live in a nation where every citizen is afforded equal rights, Sanders said in a statement issued by his campaign. For far too long our justice system has marginalized the gay community and I am very glad the Court has finally caught up to the American people. THE REPUBLICANS, Republican Jeb Bush led a number of centrist Republican candidates in trying to express disapproval of the decision without hostility to gay and lesbian Americans, and their friends and families. The Supreme Court should have allowed the states to make this decision, he said. I also believe that we should love our neighbor and respect others, including those making lifetime commitments. Neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who says he supports same-sex civil unions but not gay marriage, said that the ruling is the law of the land while I strongly disagree. Congress should make sure deeply held religious views are respected, Carson said in a statement. The government must never force Christians to violate their religious beliefs. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio also used the decision to make a case that a Republican should pick the next Supreme Court justice. Marriage should be between one man and one woman, he said in a statement, adding that those who disagree have the right to change their state laws. Rubio said that is not the right of the unelected judges or justices of the Supreme Court. While he said even those who disagree with the decision must abide by the law, Rubio added that it must be a priority of the next president to nominate judges and justices committed to applying the Constitution as written and originally understood. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina took a similarly nuanced position. The Court ruled today that all Americans should receive equal benefits and rights from the government under the law. I have always supported this view, she said in a statement. However, this decision was also about the definition of marriage itself. I do not agree that the Court can or should redefine marriage. Huckabee, a Baptist minister, decried the unconstitutional judicial tyranny of the ruling. This ruling is not about marriage equality, its about marriage redefinition, Huckabee said in a statement issued by his campaign. This irrational, unconstitutional rejection of the expressed will of the people in over 30 states will prove to be one of the courts most disastrous decisions, and they have had many. Ohio Gov. John Kasichs statement was short and to the point. The governor has always believed in the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman, but our nations highest court has spoken and we must respect its decision, said Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry said he is disappointed the Supreme Court today those to end the centuries old definition of marriage as between one man and one woman. Contending that the 10th Amendment to the Constitution leaves such definitions to states, Perry added: Our founding fathers did not intend for the judicial branch to legislate from the bench and as president, I would appoint constitutional conservatives who would apply the law as written. Jindal accused the justices of following public opinion polls and said the decision tramples on states rights that were once protected by the 10th Amendment of the Constitution. Marriage between a man and a woman was established by God, and no earthly court can alter that, he said in a statement, predicting: This decision will pave the way for an all-out assault against the religious freedom rights of Christians who disagree with this decision. Santorum said the justices made a mistake just as they have in cases from Dred Scott to Plessy, invoking the infamous 19th century rulings that upheld the institution of slavery. As president, I will be committed to using the bully pulpit of the White House to lead a national discussion on the importance to our economy and our culture of mothers and fathers entering into healthy marriages so that every child is given their birthright  to be raised by their mother and father in a stable, loving home, Santorum said in a statement issued by his campaign committee. On Twitter, Donald Trump blamed Chief Justice John Roberts, apparently neglecting the detail that Roberts voted with the minority against gay marriage and alluding to the fact that Roberts was appointed to his job by former President George W. Bush, the brother of one of Trumps rivals for the Republican presidential nomination.]", "Date": "20150626", "Title": "[Presidential candidates react to gay-marriage ruling]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/presidential-candidates-react-to-gay-marriage-ruling/", "Author": "[Heidi Przybyla]"}
{"Content": "[ Former state Republican Party chair Chris Vance will announce his candidacy Tuesday for the U.S. Senate, launching an underdog campaign against four-term Democratic incumbent Sen. Patty Murray. Vance plans to challenge Murray as part of a Congress mired in gridlock and unable to make the hard choices he says are needed to bring down the $18 trillion national debt. The dysfunction in Washington, D.C. is nothing short of a national disgrace, Vance said in an interview. It would be wrong to blame all of this on Patty Murray. But I think it would be equally wrong to say she is not a big part of the problem. Vance, 53, will make his announcement in an online video and news release followed by a round of media interviews. A former state representative and Metropolitan King County Council member from Auburn, Vance served as chairman of the state GOP from 2001 to 2006. For the past several years hes worked as a lobbyist, consultant and political commentator. Vance said hell advocate centrist, bipartisan policies on issues from immigration reform to health care. He pointed to his time on the County Council, where he worked across the aisle with Democrats to pass budget agreements and growth management laws. Murray announced last year shed seek a fifth term in 2016. A spokesman for her re-election campaign declined to comment before Vances announcement. But other Democrats were giddy at the chance to throw Vances past statements back at him and tie him to a national Republican Party that has been unpopular in this state. As GOP chair during the George W. Bush administration, Vance praised Bush in 2004 as right on the issues that matter to Washington state, the state Democratic Party noted in a news release. In contrast to his central campaign criticism, Vance also has at times complimented Murray as a skilled lawmaker and negotiator, comparing her to legendary Washington Sen. Warren Magnuson in a 2010 McClatchy newspaper profile. Jamal Raad, spokesman for the state Democrats, said he looked forward to exposing Vances record of poisonous partisanship, extremism, and George Bush idolatry. Vance said he knows Democrats will paint him with a partisan brush and said his job as state GOP chair necessarily included promoting Bush. But he vowed to show voters hes a different kind of Republican. He said hell roll out a series of papers showing voters his positions on taxes, trade, immigration and other issues. His top priority will be enacting a deficit-reduction plan along the lines of one proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission appointed by President Obama in 2010. That plan would include tax increases on wealthy Americans and a higher federal gas tax. It also would make broad cuts to federal spending and changes to benefit programs, an increase in the Social Security retirement age. Vances campaign announcement is unlikely to shake the consensus among national election observers that Murray is a safe bet for re-election. This race is not a priority for national Republicans, who primarily will be playing defense this cycle, said Kyle Kondik, managing editor for Sabatos Crystal Ball at the University of Virginias Center for Politics. Kondik noted Republicans have identified only two Senate seats held by Democrats as possible pickups in 2016  in Nevada and Colorado. He predicted the Washington Senate race would become competitive only if national conditions take a dramatic turn against Democrats. Vance said hes spoken with the National Republican Senatorial Committee and does not expect the organization to come to his aid. Wed certainly welcome it, he said. He plans to run a lean campaign with virtually no overhead and knows he cant expect to match Murray in fundraising. Her re-election campaign already has raised $6.7 million and had $3.8 million in the bank as of July. But with years of experience in politics, Vance said he knows how to run a campaign that will raise enough money to get its message across. I think the public wants people to look them in the eye and treat them like grown-ups and tell them the truth, he said.]", "Date": "20150907", "Title": "[Former GOP chair Chris Vance to challenge Sen.

{"Content": "[ FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP)  James Comer conceded, Matt Bevin accepted and Kentuckys race for governor finally got underway Friday following a tumultuous primary that left Democrats giddy and Republicans focused on uniting their scattered base. Comer, the state agriculture commissioner, conceded a day after a review of election results confirmed he lost to Bevin by 83 votes in one of the closest statewide elections in history. In a news release, he enthusiastically endorsed Bevin and promised to do everything he can to help him win in November. The race now pivots to November, where a pair of failed U.S. Senate candidates will face each other in a rare off-year election for an open governors seat. Its happening in one of the few states that still has a thriving two-party system, making it an indicator of sorts for the 2016 presidential election. Democratic nominee Jack Conway is the state attorney general who lost to U.S. Sen. Rand Paul by 11 percentage points in 2010. Bevin is an investment banker who has never held public office but famously lost badly to U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell in the 2014 Republican Senate primary. Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear, known for his enthusiastic embrace of the federal Affordable Care Act, cannot seek re-election because of term limits . Republicans quickly closed ranks Friday, holding a news conference at the state party headquarters in Frankfort with chairman Steve Robertson declaring Republicans support Bevin with every fiber of our being. Just one year ago, Bevin was a flailing candidate for Senate who was shut out from most GOP events and complained loudly about a party that would not give him a chance. He was once prevented from even approaching McConnell during a Republican dinner in Fayette County. McConnell quickly endorsed Bevin by name Friday in a one-sentence news release. But Democrats were quick to pounce on their fractured relationship, unveiling a website devoted to highlighting comments from McConnells 2014 Senate campaign that called Bevin a pathological liar and an East Coast con man. Bevin dismissed those attacks, referring to Conways campaign staff as a bunch of 14-year-olds that are talking about gibberish. If the best that youre going to hear from them is jobs, jobs and more jobs and were for the working class people, were going to run away with this. Theyve got nothing, Bevin said. What they are going to do is they are basically going to fire up all of the 14-year-olds that work for their campaign and they are going to dust off all their best snark, and if thats the best they have, giddy up. Really and truly, Im not too concerned about it. Conway seemed to welcome Bevin , and his comments, into the race, saying in a news release that Im the only candidate with a proven record of putting people over politics, and thats a commitment I promise to keep. A Bevin-Conway matchup Nov. 3 promises to be full of contrasts. Bevin has vowed to repeal Kentuckys expanded Medicaid program under the federal Affordable Care Act, a decision by Beshear that brought health insurance to more than 400,000 people across the state. Beshear cannot seek re-election because of term limits, but Conway has vowed to defend the program. Bevin has said he opposes same-sex marriage, while Conway as the state attorney general refused to defend the states gay marriage ban when a federal judge ruled it unconstitutional. Bevin said he would make Kentucky a right-to-work state, meaning people could work for Kentuckys GM plant and not be required to join a labor union. Conway has fought against counties that have tried to pass similar local ordinances, arguing labor unions lead to better pay and more benefits for working families. And Bevin has questioned the states participation in federal preschool programs, citing a federal study showing the benefits were inconsequential once a child got beyond third grade. Conway has based his campaign around expanding the states preschool programs. The difference between what we will be espousing on the Republican side and what will be coming on the Democrat side will be night and day, Bevin said.]", "Date": "20150529", "Title": "[After close primary, Kentucky governors race gets underway]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/after-close-primary-kentucky-governors-race-gets-underway/", "Author": "[ADAM BEAM]"}
{"Content": "[ Fresh off a widely praised performance in the first Republican presidential debate, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is set to make a campaign swing to Washington state next week. But dont expect to see or hear from him. The first-term U.S. senator is scheduled to attend a fundraiser at the Bellevue investment firm Steelhead Partners on Monday evening. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, No public events have been announced, and Rubios campaign-communications director, Alex Conant, said there are no plans for media interviews during the stopover. The fundraising reception will cost donors $1,000 a person. Those who want access to a more exclusive roundtable talk must fork over $2,700 each, according to a copy of the invitation. Rubio will be welcomed by several veteran Republican activists and donors, including some who gave big to GOP nominee Mitt Romneys campaign in 2012. The hosts include Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group; Diane Tebelius, an attorney and former congressional candidate; Wayne Perry, an investor who co-founded McCaw Cellular; and Bruce Chapman, co-founder of the Discovery Institute, a Seattle-based conservative think tank. Chapman, a former Washington secretary of state and Reagan administration aide, said hes impressed with Rubios rsum and called him a fresh face for politics who could lead the kind of turnover in Washington, D.C. that Ronald Reagan did. I want to see somebody nominated who can be a good president and who can win, said Chapman, stressing that he was not speaking on behalf of the Discovery Institute. A son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio, 44, rose quickly in the Florida Legislature and received national attention in 2010 when he defeated former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist to win a seat in the U.S. Senate. Some in the GOP see the youthful senator as a terrific matchup against presumed Democratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton. However, Rubio has faced scrutiny for personal financial struggles. And during Thursdays debate, he took a hard line against abortion, even in cases of rape or incest  a play for religious conservative voters which Democrats are sure to use against him if he advances to the general election.

{"Content": "[ From three years in a dictatorships jail cell to just two months away from the presidential palace, the journey has been long for Brazils newly elected leader Dilma Rousseff, who will be the first woman to direct Latin Americas biggest nation. She is a career civil servant who has never held elected office, but Rousseff easily won Sundays presidential runoff election. That was thanks to the wholehearted backing of outgoing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who for decades has been a presence on Brazils political scene and will leave office as its most popular leader. Now, the difficult part begins. Rousseff must make good on her campaign promises to continue Silvas programs that have led Brazil to new international economic and political heights. She acknowledged the challenge in her victory speech late Sunday after overcoming centrist rival Jose Serra by winning 56 percent of the vote against his 44 percent. Its a challenging and difficult task to succeed him, but I will know how to honor his legacy, she said of Silva. I will know how to advance and consolidate his work. This is exactly what her supporters and most of the base of the governing Workers Party expect. Now we are certain that the country will continue in the right direction, 26-year-old teacher Hobert dos Santos said while waving Rousseff campaign flags at a celebration on a main avenue in Sao Paulo. Dilma will be able to continue working for the people, to continue improving many of the things that Lula started and didnt have time to finish. A former Marxist guerrilla who was jailed and tortured for three years in the early 1970s for fighting against Brazils dictatorship, Rousseff is known as a demanding and skilled manager. She first served as Silvas energy minister and from 2005 until earlier this year was his chief of staff, running the day-to-day operations of the administration. Despite her tough exterior, she betrayed emotion when speaking about Silva after the election results were announced. The joy I feel with this victory today is mixed with the emotion of his farewell. I know that a leader like Lula will never be away from his people, she said, her eyes welling with tears and voice cracking. I will always be able to knock on his door and Im sure that it will always will be open. In his concession speech, Serra said he respected the voters decision and wished the president-elect good luck. Beginning Jan. 1, Rousseff, 62, will lead a nation on the rise, a country that will host the 2014 World Cup and that is expected to be the globes fifth-largest economy by the time it hosts the 2016 Summer Olympics. It has also recently discovered huge oil reserves off its coast. Silva used his 80 percent approval ratings to campaign incessantly for Rousseff, who lacks the charisma that transformed Silva from a one-time shoeshine boy into one of the globes most popular leaders. Barred by the constitution from running for a third consecutive four-year term, Silva has batted down chatter in Brazils media that he plans a new run at the presidency in 2014, which would be allowed under the law. Many Brazilians dont want Lula, as he is popularly known, to go away. If Lula ran for president 10 times, I would vote for him 10 times, said Marisa Santos, a 43-year-old selling her homemade jewelry on a Sao Paulo street. Im voting for Dilma, of course, but the truth is it will still be Lula who will lead us. Silva, 65, entered office with a background as a leftist labor leader, but he governed from a moderate perspective. Under his leadership, the economy grew strongly and Brazil weathered the global financial crisis better than most nations. He is loved within Brazil by the legions of poor, who consider the nations first working-class president one of their own. His social programs and orthodox economic policies have helped lift 20 million people out of poverty and thrust another 29 million into the middle class. I voted for Dilma because she is a fighter, said Estevam Sanches, a 43-year-old pizza parlor owner in Sao Paulo. What we need is a fighter in the presidency to continue, as she says she will, with Lulas efforts to eradicate poverty and strengthen the economy. Rousseff is the daughter of a Bulgarian immigrant father, a lawyer who died when she was 14, and a Brazilian mother who was a schoolteacher. Her past points to an early political awakening. In 1967, as a 19-year-old economics student, she joined a militant political group opposing the dictatorship. For three years she helped lead guerrilla organizations, instructed comrades on Marxist theory and wrote for an underground newspaper. Rousseff denies carrying out any acts of violence during this period, says she opposed such action and notes she was never accused by the military regime of violent acts. After three years underground, Rousseff was captured in 1970 by Brazils military police and was considered a big enough catch that a military prosecutor labeled her the Joan of Arc of the guerrilla movement. Its that image of a strong woman that Rousseff projected Sunday, saying that her first promise as president elect was to honor the women of Brazil, adding that she hoped her win would allow fathers and mothers to look their daughters in the eyes and say, Yes, a woman can., , Associated Press reporters Stan Lehman and Tales Azzoni in Sao Paulo and Marco Sibaja in Brasilia contributed to this story.]", "Date": "20101101", "Title": "[Big task ahead for Brazil new leader Rousseff]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/big-task-ahead-for-brazil-new-leader-rousseff/", "Author": "[BRADLEY BROOKS]"}

I could do the same for friends and neighbors who have just gotten back from some place and are about to leave for another. They often move in battalions meeting friends or family  who themselves have traveled great distances  in some center of cultural/culinary/scenic excellence. A few appear to spend fewer nights in their gracious homes than in airport hotels, preparing for a pre-dawn flight out. There may be no place like home, but elsewhere always seems preferable. Are we to believe that their travels are as fabulous as their Facebook posts suggest? Note the pictures showing them in some sublime Croatian village, never at overcrowded Gate 42B. The dreaded FOMO  fear of missing out  may contribute to this perpetual need to venture far. Oxford Dictionaries defines FOMO as anxiety that an exciting or interesting event may currently be happening elsewhere, often aroused by posts seen on a social media website. The mania for making bucket lists further inflames this angst. The book 1,000 Places to See Before You Die is the mother of them all. When someone asks the author, Patricia Schultz, to cite her favorite trip, she responds, My next one. Given her mile-long list of destinations, one can well believe Schultzs contention, It is rare that I return to a place where I have already been. How about the quality of time spent traveling? Youve seen those 36 Hours in Madrid travel pieces listing four hot restaurants/bars, three markets and two museums in addition to the Prado. The reality is you and a million other tourists racing around the plazas to witness the relaxed Iberian culture enjoyed by old Spaniards who themselves never go anywhere. As for Italy, Schultz raves about the Piazza del Duomo in Parma, adding that one might want to visit the city during the Festival del Prosciutto. That would knock off two items in one day. These checklists often seem a commodification of cultural experience, Rebecca Mead wrote in The New Yorker. And how deep is the experience? Some of the great sites go almost unseen by tourists using them mainly as picturesque backgrounds for their selfies. I, too, have fallen into the FOMO trap at times, gulping rather than savoring travel. Why must the most valuable trips involve being far from home and spending a lot of money? Im trying to fight back, though. Ive made peace with the fact that I will never skydive in New Zealand, heli-ski in Zermatt or bungee jump in the Vanuatu archipelago. I wouldnt mind seeing Indias Golden Temple of Amritsar or Victoria Falls in Zambia/Zimbabwe. But if I die before that happens, then I guess I wont see them. Leisure and vacation used to be more or less used interchangeably. Now theyre very different. Nonworking days are often devoted to the labor of earning more badges to place on the ledger of life.

{"Content": "[ George W. Bush shed a sentimental tear. Barack Obama mused about the burdens of the office. Bill Clinton dished out wisecracks. Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush chimed in, too, on a rare day of harmony at the dedication of the younger Bushs presidential library that glossed over the hard edges and partisan divides of five presidencies spanning more than three tumultuous decades. To know the man is to like the man, Obama declared of his Republican predecessor, speaking Thursday before a crowd of 10,000 at an event that had the feel of a class reunion for the partisans who had powered the Bush administration from 2001 to 2009. Dick Cheney was there in a white cowboy hat. Condoleezza Rice gave shout-outs to visiting dignitaries. Colin Powell and Karl Rove were prominent faces in the crowd. On this day, there was no mention of Iraq or Afghanistan, the wars that dominated Bushs presidency and so divided the nation. There were only gentle references to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. And praise aplenty for the resolve that Bush showed in responding to the 9/11 terror attacks. Clinton joked that the dedication of the George W. Bush Presidential Center was the latest, grandest example of the eternal struggle of former presidents to rewrite history. But he also praised Bush for including interactive exhibits at the center that invite visitors to make their own choices on major decisions that he faced. Bush, 66, made indirect reference to the polarizing decision points of his presidency, drawing a knowing laugh as he told the crowd: One of the benefits of freedom is that people can disagree. Its fair to say I created plenty of opportunities to exercise that right. He said he was guided throughout his presidency by a determination to expand the reach of freedom. It wasnt always easy, and it certainly wasnt always popular. It was a day for family and sentimentality, Bush choking up with emotion at the conclusion of his remarks. The 43rd president singled out his 88-year-old father, another ex-president, to tell him: 41, it is awesome that you are here today. The elder Bush, wearing jaunty pink socks, spoke for less than a minute from his wheelchair, then turned to his son and quipped, Too long? He has a form of Parkinsons disease and has been hospitalized recently for bronchitis. Just as the public tends to view presidents more kindly once theyve left office, ex-presidents, too, tend to soften their judgments  or at least their public comments  with time. Obama once excoriated Bush for his failed policies and disastrous handling of the economy, for expanding budget deficits, and for drawing the nation into war in Iraq. On Thursday, he took a detour around those matters and instead praised Bush for his strength after  9/11, compassion in fighting HIV/AIDS in Africa, bipartisanship in pursuing education reforms and restarting an important conversation by speaking with the American people about our history as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. If the country is eventually able to enact immigration changes this year, Obama added, it will be, in large part, thanks to the hard work of President George W. Bush. Obama said the living presidents make up an exclusive club  but its more like a support group for the men who have held the position. No matter how much you may think you are ready to assume the office of the presidency, its impossible to truly understand the nature of the job until its yours, Obama said. And thats why every president gains a greater appreciation for all of those who served before them. The other presidents struck a similar tone. Clinton praised Bush for his efforts to combat AIDS in Africa, his work on global health and even for the paintings hes doing in retirement. And he said hed gotten so close to the Bush family that there were jokes that I had become the black sheep son. Carter praised Bush for his role in helping secure peace between North and South Sudan in 2005 and the great contributions youve made to the most needy people on earth. Bush has kept a decidedly low profile since leaving office four years ago with an approval rating of just 33 percent. That figure has been gradually climbing and now is at 47 percent  about equal to Obamas own approval rating, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released ahead of the library opening. If politics was absent from the podium on Thursday, it was still a prominent subtext. Those in attendance included a number of potential candidates for president in 2016  another Clinton (Hillary) and Bush (Jeb) among them. George W. Bush in recent days played up the idea of his younger brother, the former governor of Florida, seeking the White House, telling C-SPAN, My first advice is: Run. Their mother, former first lady Barbara Bush, did the opposite. Weve had enough Bushes, she said Thursday on NBCs Today show. The presidential center at Southern Methodist University includes a library, museum and policy institute. It contains more than 70 million pages of paper records, 200 million emails, 4 million digital photos and 43,000 artifacts. Bushs library will feature the largest digital holdings of any of the 13 presidential libraries under the auspices of the National Archives and Records Administration. A full-scale replica of the Oval Office as it looked during Bushs tenure sits on the campus, as does a piece of steel from the World Trade Center and the bullhorn that Bush used to punctuate the chaos at ground zero three days after 9/11. In the museum, visitors can gaze at a container of chads  the remnants of the famous Florida punch card ballots that played a pivotal role in the contested 2000 election that sent Bush to Washington.

{"Content": "[ Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey announced Monday that he would drop his legal challenge to same-sex marriage, hours after same-sex couples started exchanging vows in midnight ceremonies across the state. Christies withdrawal of his appeal to the court decision that allowed the marriages came on the heels of a ruling by the states Supreme Court on Friday that rejected his attempt to block the marriages until the appeal was resolved. His decision effectively removed the last hurdle to making same-sex marriage legal in New Jersey. Although the governor strongly disagrees with the court substituting its judgment for the constitutional process of the elected branches or a vote of the people, the court has now spoken clearly as to their view of the New Jersey Constitution and, therefore, same-sex marriage is the law, a spokesman for Christie said in a note to reporters Monday morning. The governor will do his constitutional duty and ensure his administration enforces the law as dictated by the New Jersey Supreme Court. At 12:01 a.m. New Jersey joined 13 other states and the District of Columbia in allowing gay couples to marry. As images of joyous wedding celebrations from Jersey City to Asbury Park filled the airwaves, Christie sent a letter overnight to the lawyers fighting on behalf of the gay couples in the court case, and to the Supreme Court, announcing that he would drop any further opposition. Christie, a Republican widely considered a leading contender for his partys presidential nomination in 2016, has long tried to walk a fine line on same-sex marriage, which polls show is popular in his home state but opposed by conservative voters in key primary states. Last year, he vetoed legislation allowing same-sex marriage, arguing that voters should decide the issue in a referendum instead. As recently as last week, he repeated his position that he believed marriage to be between a man and a woman. But the court was unanimous in its decision to deny the administrations request for a stay on marriages, and the justices said in their decision that they believed the administrations appeal had no reasonable probability of success. The governor, in consultation with his attorney general and chief counsel, concluded it would be what one aide called a fools errand to continue in the face of almost certain failure. Christies advisers said they did not believe it would hurt him politically; the governor has long branded himself as the kind of politician that voters like because they know where he stands, even if they do not agree with him. In this case, he can argue that he did not reverse his position; he still opposes same-sex marriage, but his back was to the wall. In the short term  he stands for re-election in two weeks  he may win some votes in New Jersey. Among conservative voters in 2016, he can blame activist judges  an argument that also resonates among Republican primary voters. He looks realistic, while sticking to his principles  and people are happy, one adviser said. Lawrence Lustberg, who argued the case for the gay and lesbian couples before the state Supreme Court, said that as he attended the overnight wedding celebrations, he was anticipating the governors decision, which then was confirmed by the letter he received Monday morning. I think the handwriting was on the wall as clearly as it could possibly be, he said. The governor had always said he would fight this all the way up to the Supreme Court, but he didnt say he was going to fight it to the Supreme Court twice. As a matter of reasonable lawyering on the one hand, and a clear perception of what the courts position was on the other, this was inevitable. The legal landscape has changed significantly since Christie vetoed legislation in 2012 that would have made gay marriage legal in the state. In June, the Supreme Court struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act and declared that the federal government must provide the same benefits to gay married couples as it does to heterosexual married couples. Using that ruling as the legal underpinning for a decision issued last month, Judge Mary Jacobson of state Superior Court in Mercer County found that the states not allowing same-sex couples to get married deprived them of getting federal benefits and is currently harming same-sex couples in New Jersey in a wide range of contexts. Christie immediately said he would appeal the decision and sought a stay to prevent the marriages from taking place starting on Oct. 21, as the court ordered. The petition was denied, and the first couples across the state were married just after midnight Monday. In denying the bid to halt the marriages, Chief Justice Stuart Rabner of the states Supreme Court indicated that the Christie administration was likely to lose its appeal. The state has advanced a number of arguments, but none of them overcome this reality: Same-sex couples who cannot marry are not treated equally under the law today, he wrote. The harm to them is real, not abstract or speculative. Christie acknowledged that the legal fight was most likely a lost cause. Chief Justice Rabner left no ambiguity about the unanimous courts view on the ultimate decision in this matter, a spokesman said. Some groups opposed to same-sex marriage were critical of both activist judges in New Jersey, as well as Christie. The mark of a leader is to walk a principled walk no matter the difficulty of the path, said Brian Brown, president of the nonprofit National Organization for Marriage. Chris Christie has failed the test, abandoning both voters and the core institution of society  marriage as the union of one man and one woman. Advocates of same-sex marriage viewed Christies withdrawal from the legal battle as the victory they have long sought. This is the day weve been waiting for. This is the day weve been fighting for. This is the day we won, said Troy Stevenson, executive director of Garden State Equality, the states most prominent gay-rights group.

{"Content": "[ Gov. Chris Christies decision to stop fighting gay marriage in New Jersey was pragmatic  same sex weddings had already begun and a court warned that the state would have little chance of overturning them. But the move also reflects Christies bid to cast himself as leader of a welcoming GOP as he seeks re-election and ponders a White House bid. Friends and foes describe the move simply as Christie being Christie. The tell-it-like-it-is governor is signaling that he wont be intimidated by a vocal conservative minority that usually wields great influence in Republican presidential politics. And with political divisions deepening in the Republican Party, Christie is betting his political future that the GOP and the nation ultimately would embrace an unapologetic compromiser capable of attracting a broad coalition of voters  as hes expected to do in gubernatorial voting in two weeks. There are clear risks. While national public opinion is evolving, Republicans who oppose gay marriage traditionally dominate GOP politics in early-voting states on the presidential calendar such as Iowa and South Carolina. Abandoning foundational principles that go beyond politics is not the way to get positive attention in South Carolina, said Bob McAlister, a veteran South Carolina-based Republican strategist, adding that Christies latest move is absolutely going to hurt him. Christie remains personally opposed to gay marriage. He vetoed a bill approved by the legislature last year to legalize the practice. When a trial-level judge ruled last month that the state must allow same-sex couples to wed, Christie appealed that ruling to the state Supreme Court. The high court agreed to take up the case but unanimously refused to delay the start of gay weddings in the meantime, saying the state had little chance of prevailing in its appeal. And just hours after gay couples began exchanging vows on Monday, Christie announced that he was withdrawing his appeal. The decision makes New Jersey the 14th state to legalize gay marriage. Advisers to the governor said that in dropping the appeal, Christie stayed true to his principles. Although the governor strongly disagrees with the court substituting its judgment for the constitutional process of the elected branches or a vote of the people, the court has now spoken clearly as to their view of the New Jersey Constitution and, therefore, same-sex marriage is the law, Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said in a statement. Some Republicans wanted Christie to fight harder. Hes in much the same situation as 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who was governor when the Massachusetts Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage almost a decade ago. Romney, too, said he was forced to comply with the rule of law once it was settled by the courts. But that wasnt enough to win over many skeptical conservatives. Their skepticism helped force a long and expensive primary fight against former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, whose underdog campaign was largely fueled by his opposition to gay marriage and abortion. Rudy Giuliani, the former Republican presidential contender and New York City mayor, also struggled to gain traction in 2008 after embracing abortion rights and legal benefits for same-sex couples. That same year, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, an ordained Southern Baptist minister, won the Iowa caucuses riding an aggressive social conservative agenda. He later fizzled in states like New Hampshire, where moderate Republicans and independents hold more sway. Republicans across the political spectrum concede that public opinion on same-sex marriage in 2016 is likely to be dramatically different than 2008 or even 2012. A CNN-ORC poll found in June that 34 percent of Republicans supported legal recognition of same sex marriage, a number that had jumped more than 10 points from a year earlier. The poll found strong majorities of independents and Democrats in favor as well. While conservative leaders in early voting states lashed out at Christies decision, there are signs even in social conservative strongholds that Christies bet is a smart one. Susan Geddes, an Iowa Republican activist and devout social conservative, says voters, including Republicans, care far less about opposing gay marriage than even 10 years ago. You have to explain to people, people like me, that the rest of the world doesnt think the way we do, said Geddes, who served as a top campaign consultant to strict conservative Republican candidates for the past several years. Thats upsetting for people. But if we want to have our party be effective, we have to accept opinions like that. Indeed, Iowa mainstream Republicans, led by Gov. Terry Branstad, are trying to swell the ranks of more economically minded conservatives, in hopes of increasing attendance at the Iowa GOP caucuses in 2016. The caucuses have been flooded by social conservatives who disproportionately oppose gay rights and abortion rights. David Kochel, who served as Romneys top Iowa strategist, came out in favor of gay marriage earlier in the year. Opposing the freedom to marry is a loser for our party and serves to drive away a growing number of voters who have turned the page, he said Monday. A number of New Hampshire Republicans, former Rep. Charlie Bass among them, also have come out in favor of gay marriage, backed by Republican leaders elsewhere such as Ohio Sen. Rob Portman and former Vice President Dick Cheney. In New Hampshire, where independent voters are allowed to vote in GOP primaries, there is a sense that Christies move could actually help him in a prospective presidential bid. Ultimately, some strategists said its unlikely that Christies decision on gay marriage will be a make-or-break issue. Many critics of his gay marriage policy didnt like him to begin with, particularly since his embrace of President Barack Obama weeks before the last election after Superstorm Sandy ravaged much of the East Coast. He has fallen out of favor with social conservatives around Iowa. But it probably doesnt change anything, said Darryl Kearney, GOP treasurer in Polk County and a devout social conservative. A big win in his re-election bid will help him make him a strong national candidate, which will have a strong appeal in Iowa, but not with social conservatives.

{"Content": "[ Gov. Jay Inslee took his bully pulpit underground Friday into the future University of Washington Station, to send a message that nothing less than $15 billion is acceptable to expand the regional light-rail network. That number has created a stumbling block in Olympia, as lawmakers try for a third year to agree on a massive transportation package. The Senate, controlled by Republicans, approved an 11.7-cent gas-tax increase, predominantly for highways, while limiting Sound Transit to $11 billion in a separate tax measure that would go to voters in urban Snohomish, King and Pierce counties next year. Sound Transit is asking to allow this mix of taxes to reach the 2016 ballot. These would bring in $15 billion from 2017 to 2032. With federal funding and long-term debt, the value of new projects would be higher, agency staff predict.  Property tax of up to $25 per $100,000 of assessed value, per year.  Sales tax of up to 50 cents per $100 purchase (in addition to 90 cents already collected by Sound Transit and 90 cents by King County Metro.) ,  Motor-vehicle excise-tax increase to $80 per $10,000 of vehicle value. (The agency currently collects $30 per $10,000.), Source: Sound Transit, Sound Transit says it needs $15billion to build tracks to Everett, Redmond, Tacoma, Ballard and West Seattle, and provide Interstate 405 bus-rapid transit. The goal is to stretch routes voters previously approved to Northgate, Lynnwood, Overlake and Highline Community College, in the early 2020s, with debt to be paid off around 2053. In the Democratic-controlled House, the transportation committee approved the highway list plus the full $15 billion Sound Transit wants  leaving a $4 billion rift. The UW station will open early next year, auspicious timing for a 2016 ballot measure, in a presidential-election year. Inslee was a student at UW in 1970, when a local ballot measure for high-speed transit narrowly failed, and federal aid went to MARTA in Atlanta. Elected officials have invoked this episode for at least a dozen years to justify tax requests. Isnt it great that after 46 years we get Link rail coming to this station? he said, surrounded by midnight-blue station tiles. The $1.8billion, three-mile tunnel will link Westlake Station, Capitol Hill and the UW campus in an eight-minute ride. A bridge, or a light-rail system, is a monument to optimism, he said. Traffic congestion is bad and can only get worse. I am confident we can solve the problem. Some lawmakers are reluctant to allow Sound Transit the entire menu of sales tax, property tax and car-tab tax it desires. Rep. Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle and chairman of the House Finance Committee, said he is 110 percent behind building more transit, but he objects that the Sound Transit proposal nudges the state closer to constitutional limits on property tax. That could mean less leeway to boost taxes for education, he said. Within three years, Carlyle forecasts the Legislature will seek property-tax increases to fully fund schools, to get out from under a contempt-of-court order. Im not going to throw 1 million school kids under the bus, for the trains, said Carlyle, even though a proposed Ballard train spur would serve his district. Carlyle said he would support other ideas to reach $15 billion, such as charging a yearly $50 per head payroll tax at companies with more than 50 employees, plus a higher car-tab tax. However, politicians are generally unwilling to offend business groups; the Seattle City Council repealed its $25 head tax for transportation in 2009. Sound Transit Chairman Dow Constantine, the King County executive, predicted a $15 billion request has greater odds of winning an election than an $11 billion version  because rail could be promised to more voters. Not lost on him is the likelihood that $4billion makes the difference between reaching or missing Constantines own neighborhood in West Seattle with rail. The genesis of an $11 billion GOP ceiling isnt entirely clear, but Sen. Ann Rivers, R-La Center, Clark County, recalls that when she heard a $15 billion request, many of us raised a brow. Sen. David Frockt, D-Seattle, and Rep. Jake Fey, D-Tacoma, said the $4 billion gap seems designed to give senators leverage in writing a compromise bill. Republican planks include sending sales tax on road construction to the road fund instead of to the general fund; and deterring Inslee from imposing costly low-carbon fuel regulations. In the end we have a very good shot on getting the full authority thats in the House package, Frockt said. Inslee wouldnt say if hed sign or veto a bill that falls short of Sound Transits request. I dont answer questions like that. I answer questions about what the right thing to do is. Our region is at risk if we dont at least free people to evaluate the full funding package.]", "Date": "20150417", "Title": "[On tour of UW station, Inslee backs $15 billion tax plan for more light rail]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/inslee-touts-need-for-light-rail-backs-15-billion-to-expand-line/", "Author": "[Mike Lindblom]"}

Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C. chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, sent a letter to Clinton on Tuesday asking that she sit for a transcribed interview regarding her use of private email and a personal server for official State Department business by May 1. Seattle Times news services, The attention to Walkers likely candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination has focused on weighty matters such as his battles with the left, faltering forays into foreign policy and solid conservative stances on social issues including abortion and gun rights. But little notice has been given to an area in which he faces a different sort of constitutional challenge: overcoming his aversion to mans best friend. Jeb Bush can lament how he lost a Labrador (named for his brother Marvin) to cancer. Marco Rubio has a Shih Tzu, with a name like a gift from heaven: Manna. Ted Cruz goes one better: His rescue mutt is called Snowflake. (Dear Jesus, please, please, PLEASE bring us a puppy, his daughters prayed, according to Cruzs Facebook page.) And if Walker makes it to November, he could face Hillary Rodham Clinton and her toy poodle, Tally. Walker, who gives a gloomy stump speech filled with worry, perhaps could use a four-legged image softener of his own. But he is allergic to dog dander, an aide confirmed. And in that, he is running against the long sweep of U.S. political history. If the ritual for presidential candidates wooing American voters had a handbook, must love dogs would be somewhere near the front. At the Newseum in Washington, the First Dogs: American Presidents and Their Pets exhibit is listed as on display indefinitely. On the National Mall, the memorial to Franklin D. Roosevelt depicts his Scottish terrier, Fala, forever at his feet. Puppy love in presidential campaigns dates at least to Herbert Hoover, who loosened up his stiff and sober image by posing, paws in hands, with King Tut, his Belgian Malinois, on the way to victory in 1928. It humanizes them, said Claire McLean, founder of the Presidential Pet Museum. It shows that they are just like me and you, with the kids and the dog. The potential contenders in the 2016 field are quick to offer furry proof of their humanity. Clinton and Tally posed in People magazine. Vice President Joe Biden shows grade-schoolers pictures of his dog Champ. The list goes on. Martin OMalley, the former Maryland governor, has Rex, a cocker spaniel, and Winston, a mutt. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has a dachshund, a black Lab, a mutt and a Griffon named Duchess. Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon, has a German shepherd named Echo; former Sen. Rick Santorum has spent the last year mourning his own shepherd, Schatzie. Even candidates who are not dog owners strongly hint that they intend to become dog owners: A spokeswoman for Bobby Jindal said that he likes dogs! and is looking to get one when he leaves the Louisiana governors mansion. Walkers allergies prevent such a possibility, a situation that his spokeswoman called unfortunate because he loves animals. (In fairness, Walker, who had a fish growing up, is not the only allergic White House aspirant: Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey is also allergic to dogs, and his children had to settle for a goldfish.), In a possible sign of his will to win, Walker has managed to suppress his allergic reactions in the past. In 2010, during his initial run for governor, he greeted Lisa Bell, a Republican activist who had been tossing her Wire Fox terrier, Diva, in the air during his speech. Bell recalled that Walker was very nice to the dog and pet her. Perhaps to compensate for his difficulty, Walker has reached out to more exotic animals. He did the bear encounter and giraffe encounter, said Judith Domaszek, who runs Wildwood Wildlife Park in Minocqua, Wis. which Walker visited last summer. She said he petted and fed fruit juice to a kinkajou, a small mammal often called a honey bear. He had no problems there, and they have lots of dander, Domaszek said. While earlier presidents preferred horses or birds  William McKinleys Mexican parrot was said to be named Washington Post  dogs have a more storied presidential history. President Hardings Airedale terrier, Laddie Boy, had his own chair at Cabinet meetings. Republicans accused FDR of sending a destroyer to the Aleutian Islands to pick up Fala, who had his own secretary. Richard Nixon may have saved his spot on the Eisenhower ticket in 1952 with his televised speech focusing on his daughters cocker spaniel, Checkers. And President Lyndon Johnson appalled reporters by lifting his beagles, Him and Her, by their ears. Candidates would be unwise to try that. It was often noted in 2012 that Mitt Romney once drove from Boston to Canada with the family Irish setter, Seamus, in a crate on the roof of the car. Seamus survived. But presidential dogs have met their ends in poignant ways. President Lincolns Fido, a yellowish-brown mongrel, was killed by a knife-wielding drunk not long after the presidents assassination. President George W. Bushs dog Spot had a series of strokes, and Bush communed with her on the South Lawn, stroking her head to say goodbye before having her put down.

{"Content": "[ GUATEMALA CITY (AP)  Guatemalas newly sworn-in president demanded that all top government officials submit their resignations and promised an honest and inclusive administration following the surprise resignation earlier Thursday of President Otto Perez Molina amid a widening fraud investigation. After President Alejandro Maldonado took office, a judge ordered Perez Molina held until Friday morning, when his corruption hearing was to reconvene. The former president was seen entering a military barracks where he will spend the night in custody. Maldonado reached out to protesters who took to the streets against the countrys entrenched corruption, promising he would leave a legacy of honesty and restore faith in Guatemalas democracy in his brief few months in office. You cant consider your work done, Maldonado said in remarks aimed at all those demanding change. In what is left of this year, there must be a positive response. The unprecedented political drama played out after a week in which Perez Molina was stripped of his immunity, deserted by key members of his Cabinet, and saw his jailed former vice president ordered to stand trial. All this just days before Sundays election to choose his successor. Perez Molina, the first Guatemalan president to resign, appeared in court Thursday accused of involvement in a scheme in which businesspeople paid bribes to avoid import duties through Guatemalas customs agency. Judge Miguel Angel Galvez ordered him held overnight, citing a need to ensure the continuity of the hearing and guarantee the former presidents personal safety. Perez Molina, 64, reiterated his willingness to face the investigation head-on. I have always said I will respect due process, he said. I do not have the slightest intention of leaving the country. Earlier in the day, the retired military general insisted upon his innocence in an interview with The Associated Press during a break in the court proceedings, saying the process had been very hard, very difficult. He said he could have derailed the investigation, but didnt. I had things I could have done, Perez Molina said. I could have replaced the prosecutor, I could have dug in. Analysts say the resignation was a key blow to corruption in the country and a boost for the rule of law. In the midst of this political crisis there is interesting and good news, said Eric Olson, a Central America expert at the Washington-based Wilson Center. The attorney general resisted strong pressures and even asked for the president to be incarcerated  that shows the institutions in Guatemala under the right circumstances can operate and be effective. Maldonado, a 79-year-old conservative former high court justice, has served as Guatemalas foreign minister and in ambassadorial posts. He also formerly headed Guatemalas highest court, where he presided over much-debated decisions like the one not to extradite former dictator Efrain Rios Montt. Rios Montt faced charges in Spain for genocide, torture and terrorism committed at the height of Guatemalas 1960-1996 civil war, and the decision against extradition was hotly criticized. Upon taking office Thursday, Maldonado said he was going to form a transition government and invite all the social groups that are protesting in the streets to propose young professionals to form the new administration. The corruption scandal that engulfed Perez Molinas government was uncovered by prosecutors and the United Nations commission against impunity, which have mounted a huge investigation into fiscal fraud. The scheme they uncovered, known as La Linea, or The Line, involved businesspeople paying bribes to avoid import duties through the customs agency. The ring is believed to have defrauded the state of millions of dollars. Ex-Vice President Roxana Baldettis former personal secretary was named as the alleged ringleader and is a fugitive. She resigned May 8 because of the same scandal and is now jailed and facing charges. She also maintains her innocence. A growing protest movement brought together Guatemalans from all walks of life demanding that Perez Molina step down. Business leaders and even Catholic church officials had called for him to resign in recent weeks as the investigation of the customs fraud ring has grown wider and hit more officials. Perez Molina was steadfast in his plan to stay until the judges unprecedented order, only deciding to resign in the middle of the night. His spokesman told reporters the president submitted his resignation to maintain the institution of the presidency and resolve on his own the legal proceedings leveled against him. Perez Molina was elected in 2011 on a platform of cracking down on crime. He is a retired general who participated in the countrys 36-year bloody civil war, and later in the march toward peace. His critics say he also took part in the mass killings of civilians, but he has never been charged with anything. His election as president had worried leftist groups and human rights organizations because of the militarys past control of the government. But Perez Molina has been a political moderate who has kept the military at arms length, proposing at one point to legalize drugs to rid his country of the scourge of cartels and trafficking. Maldonado will likely remain in office until the winner of upcoming elections is inaugurated Jan. 14, 2016. The first round is on Sunday, pitting a wealthy businessman and politician against 13 other candidates, including a comedian with no political experience, a former first lady and the daughter of an ex-dictator accused of genocide. If none of the candidates reaches 50 percent, a runoff will be held Oct. 25. Protesters filling the streets have also demanded that Sundays presidential elections be postponed.

{"Content": "[ Hillary Rodham Clintons initial primary-campaign spending total, $18.7 million, is a lot of money. And she is using it very differently from her rivals. While others spend their money to generate more fundraising, she has built a campaign organization with an eye toward the general election. Her campaigns burn rate, the amount spent divided by what is raised, was just a little less than 40 percent through June 30. Thats only a bit higher than the campaigns of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney at the same point four years ago, and close to the 38 percent burn rate of Obamas campaign in the first half of 2007. But comparing Clintons spending with those of her rivals is complicated, because she is running a different campaign. Most of the presidential candidates have emphasized spending money to raise more money, whether online or through direct mail, over other kinds of spending. Ted Cruz, a Republican, reported spending $835,798 on postage and an additional $678,730 on fundraising phone calls. Ben Carson, another Republican hopeful, spent $1.47 million on his digital efforts and $788,114 on printing and postage. Clinton isnt ignoring fundraising; she spent more than $2.5 million on direct marketing and additional amounts on events and catering. She has spent millions of dollars on staff, advertising and polling, establishing a much broader campaign than any other 2016 presidential candidate. Much of the money has gone toward mounting an effective operation in the early primary and caucus states, and for building the foundation for a broad general-election campaign should she become the Democratic nominee. Her $3.7 million in staff salary expenses (not including payroll taxes and service fees) is more than 10 times that of Cruz, who has the next-largest campaign in terms of staff payments. The 20 percent that Clinton spent on staff dwarfs that of all but the campaigns of Republican Mike Huckabee (21 percent) and Democrat Martin OMalley (20 percent). Clintons campaign employed 343 people, according to Federal Election Commission (FEC) data. The address of nearly all campaign workers listed in FEC records is the New York campaign headquarters, a tactic that Romney used. That makes it harder to tell exactly how much of a footprint the campaign has in say, Iowa, where it has paid $64,369 in rent. As of June 30, the Clinton campaign paid at least 58 field organizers, had spent more than $1 million on online advertising and paid a total of $370,000 to state parties in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina for voter data. On Friday, the Clinton campaign also said it had purchased $7.7 million worth of television airtime in early primary states, making its first ad buy of the 2016 election. The campaign said it has reserved time starting in early November through the first caucus and primary elections in early February, but it could broadcast the spots sooner if necessary. Jeb Bush, who spent slightly more than $3 million, devoted much of it to travel and other expenses related to testing the waters for his candidacy. He spent $372,647 on IT equipment and consulting services. The campaign of Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who is also seeking the Democratic nomination, put its largest investment into digital advertising and consulting, spending $1.3 million. Its payroll expenses were just $61,045, although Sanders campaign has not been operating as long as Clintons.

{"Content": "[ House Republicans want Congress to address the troubled finances of Social Securitys disability program, setting the stage for a contentious debate that could affect 11 million people in the middle of the next presidential campaign. The House has adopted a procedural rule that could force lawmakers to tackle the issue by the end of 2016, when the program is projected to run out of reserves, triggering automatic benefit cuts. An easy fix was available. Congress could have redirected payroll tax revenue from Social Securitys much larger retirement program, as lawmakers have done before. But Tuesdays procedural rule blocks such a move, unless as part of a larger plan to improve Social Securitys finances, by either cutting benefits or raising taxes. The rule only applies to the House. Tinkering with Social Security never has been easy, and factoring in election-year politics makes finding votes even harder for those alternatives. Rep. Tom Reed, R-N.Y. said he sponsored the provision to prevent Congress from raiding the retirement fund to prop up the disability program. Reed said lawmakers are working on proposals to bolster the disability programs finances, but that taking tax money from the retirement program is a short-term Band-Aid. We need to do better than that, Reed said. Added the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis.: We just want to make sure we improve the integrity of the Social Security trust fund all across the board. Advocates for older Americans say the rule could be used to help push through benefit cuts, especially because House Republicans have opposed raising taxes. This is a blatant attempt on the first day members take office to sneak a rule into the process that virtually guarantees devastating cuts for beneficiaries of the Social Security disability system, said J. David Cox, president of the American Federation of Government Employees. David Certner of AARP said it would be a mistake to eliminate the option of redirecting money from the retirement fund. Otherwise, we could be facing a deadline, and certainly over the last couple of years, weve seen Congress seemingly unable to pass bills, even with deadlines in front of them, Certner said. New House rules will govern the chamber for the next two years. The 36-page set of rules passed by a vote of 234-172, with all Democrats opposed and almost every Republican in favor. On page 32 is a provision that allows any representative to raise a point of order if the House tries to pass a bill redirecting tax revenue from Social Securitys retirement fund to the disability fund. The House could vote to overcome the objection, but that could be difficult, with almost every Republican supporting the rules package. The number of workers, spouses and children receiving Social Security disability benefits has ballooned over the past decade. Members of Congress from both political parties say fraud has played a part, too. About 11 million people get disability benefits, nearly 40 percent more than a decade ago. By comparison, about 48 million people get Social Security retirement or survivor benefits. Unless Congress acts, the trust fund that supports the disability program will run dry sometime during the last three months of 2016, according to projections by the trustees who oversee Social Security. At that point, the program will collect only enough payroll taxes to pay 81 percent of benefits. That would trigger an automatic 19 percent cut in benefit payments. The average monthly payment for a disabled worker is $1,146, or a little less than $14,000 a year. Social Security is supported by a 12.4 percent tax on wages up to $118,500. Half is paid by workers and half by employers. Most of the payroll tax  10.6 percent of wages  goes to the retirement fund. The remaining 1.8 percent of wages goes to the disability fund. Social Securitys retirement trust fund is projected to run dry in 2034. At that point, it would only collect enough payroll taxes to pay about 75 percent of benefits. Social Security has more than $2.7 trillion in reserves, but the retirement program has been paying out more in benefits than it collects in payroll taxes since 2010. The disability program has been paying out more than it collects since 2005. If the retirement fund and the disability fund were combined, they would have enough money to pay full benefits until 2033, giving lawmakers more time to address their long-term finances.

{"Content": "[ House Speaker John Boehner declared Friday that President Barack Obama was damaging the presidency with his unilateral action on immigration. He said the Republican-run House will not stand by, but gave no hint of what the response would be. I will say to you, the House will, in fact, act, Boehner, R-Ohio, said at a news conference the morning after Obama announced plans to offer deportation relief and work permits to 5 million immigrants who are in the country illegally. We will listen to the American people, we will work with our members and we will work to protect the Constitution of the United States, Boehner said. But Republicans have few good options as they scramble for a solution that satisfies irate conservatives without alienating moderates, Hispanics and other voters who will be crucial for the 2016 presidential election. Possibilities include suing Obama or trying to fight his moves through the budget process. The situation poses a major challenge for Boehner and incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. barely two weeks after midterm election victories that handed Republicans control of the Senate and increased the partys majority in the House. Obamas move forces them to inaugurate their newly minted congressional majorities amid frantic GOP infighting that party leaders wanted to avoid. With Republicans seething over Obamas go-it-alone approach on such a contentious issue, its an open question whether Boehner and McConnell will be able to rein in the tea party faction in Congress that forced a politically damaging government shutdown a year ago over the presidents health care law. The answer will have major implications in determining whether the GOP can hang onto its newfound control of Congress and hope to win the White House in two years. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. one of the fiercest opponents of Obamas actions, ruled out impeachment, telling the conservative Heritage Foundation, we are not going to impeach or move to impeach. Sessions did insist that the Congress can use its power over spending to affect the immigration initiative. What did the president do? He pulled the pin on the grenade two weeks after the election, said Rep. Pat Tiberi, R-Ohio, a Boehner ally. I dont think anybody knows or can predict what happens and the carnage that this creates quite frankly for the legislative process. Boehner took issue with Obamas claim that he had to act because House Republicans never moved on the bipartisan immigration bill that passed the Senate last year. That measure offered a path to citizenship for many of the 11 million immigrants here illegally, going further than Obama can on his own. Boehner said it was Obamas fault because lawmakers didnt trust him after earlier unilateral moves on health care. He created an environment where the members would not trust him, and trying to find a way to work together was virtually impossible, Boehner said. I warned the president over and over that his actions were making it impossible for me to do what he wanted me to do. Conservative lawmakers are pushing to insert language in upcoming must-pass spending bills to block Obamas order. Party leaders warn that could lead to a government shutdown. The chairman of the House Appropriations Chairman, Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Ky. also argues it is impossible to defund the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services because it pays for itself based on application fees. Rogers is pushing for a yearlong spending bill to get spending fights out of the way, and then finding some other way to respond to Obama. Thats angered some conservatives who argued that establishment Republicans were just looking for a way out of a necessary confrontation with the president. Theyre contriving red herring arguments to get to the point where enough members will walk out of this Congress and go home for Thanksgiving and say, Well, theres nothing we can do, said Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, who was among a small group of conservatives arguing impeachment should be on the table as a last resort.]", "Date": "20141121", "Title": "[Boehner: We will not stand idle on immigration]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/boehner-we-will-not-stand-idle-on-immigration/", "Author": "[ERICA WERNER]"}
{"Content": "[ I knew the housing situation in Seattle was bad. But I realized we hit a new low when friends visiting from New York City expressed shock at how high our rents are. Seattle is one of the fastest growing cities in the country. Add to that an intensifying rent-control debate, concerns over discrimination in housing and mounting Amazon Angst, and you  like me  may be feeling a little panicked about Seattles future. If our city is becoming too expensive in the eyes of New Yorkers, how do low-income and diverse communities stand a chance? What will this city  beloved for its open-mindedness, welcoming creativity and raw Northwestern feel  look like in 10 years?, Overwhelmed by conversations offering more complaints than solutions, I went looking for a model of low-income housing that might work. What I found, rising in the heart of Beacon Hill, felt like a light in a cityscape where newly minted, high-priced condos cast long, dark shadows. [There will be] poetry, music, people are going to get married [here]  says Estela Ortega, executive director of El Centro de la Raza as her hands pass over a series of architectural drawings. Pointing at a large screen in the public plaza shes describing, she adds, [The community] wanted outdoor movies in the evenings during summer. Ortegas not describing amenities at the newest downtown yuppie complex. These are the plans for Plaza Roberto Maestas, a low-income housing development the community organization is building. The Plaza, named after Ortegas late husband, Roberto Maestas, one of the co-founders of El Centro, slated to have 112 rental units and be completed by next summer. It will house 300 to 350 people designated as low-income (defined as earning roughly between $24,000-$49,000 a year per family). Housing will be constructed on either side of the historic Beacon Hill School where El Centro has been housed since its founding (through occupation of the then-abandoned building) in 1972. The Plaza was inspired by El Centros homeless-service program, which increasingly had to place its clients outside Seattle city limits due to high housing costs. El Centro wanted to do something that would help retain Beacon Hills diversity. Building a project like this is critical to the health of a community, says El Centros Stephen Deal, who has helped run a capital campaign for the $42 million project that includes public and private funding, You want that diversity, you want that economic diversity, you want that ethnic and racial diversity. That sense of community service is at the heart of The Plaza project and can be felt throughout the process of its development. Ortega says El Centro met with the community more than 30 times to seek input for the design. That feedback has resulted in a commissary kitchen (for commercial food production  especially convenient for food-truck owners), kiosks for small vendors, and a public plaza. In addition, Plaza Roberto Maestas will have commercial space (already all rented) and classrooms for El Centros early-childhood development programs. Its also adjacent to the Beacon Hill light-rail station. Ortega and Deal say El Centro is the only community organization working on a low-income housing project of this scale in Washington, but it hopes to serve as a model for others  especially since revenue from the project will help sustain and grow El Centros services. Ortega says she would have never thought, as a 22-year-old political activist helping to occupy a dim and crowded old building, that 40 years later El Centro would be at the helm of a project of this size. But she believes the spirit of the old days is still present. She recalls how  when the media asked Maestas how the old school building would be used once commandeered  he responded, There is going to be an explosion of creativity. And that is whats happening with [The Plaza Roberto Maestas], says Ortega as bulldozers rumble behind her at the construction site. That explosion of creativity is really happening. Its a memory of Seattles past and  perhaps  a vision for our future.]", "Date": "20150806", "Title": "[El Centro constructs an answer for affordable housing]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/el-centro-constructs-an-answer-for-affordable-housing/", "Author": "[NULL]"}
{"Content": "[ If Hillary Rodham Clintons new apology for her private email server fails to reassure jittery supporters, it could amplify the chatter among some Democrats who have been casting about for a potential white knight to rescue the party from a beleaguered Clinton candidacy. Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, former Vice President Al Gore: Each has been discussed among party officials in recent weeks as an alternative to Clinton if she does not regain her once-dominant standing in the 2016 presidential field and, instead, remains mired in the long-running email controversy, with its attendant investigations. On Monday, Biden, who has spoken publicly of pondering a run, looked very much like a candidate at a Pittsburgh union gathering and Labor Day parade. And some Democrats were intrigued by word that Kerry, the 2004 Democratic nominee, had met recently in Nantucket, Mass. with David Rubenstein, a billionaire co-founder of the Carlyle Group  and the sort of Washington wise man Kerry might consult if he were mulling another run. (Friends say he isnt.), It is not just Clintons weakness in the polls that has generated talk of other alternatives, but also the strength of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is routinely drawing huge crowds at campaign events. That has been disconcerting to Democratic officials who believe Sanders, a socialist, is so liberal that his presence at the top of the partys ticket in 2016 would be disastrous. If party leaders see a scenario next winter where Bernie Sanders has a real chance at the Democratic nomination, I think theres no question that leaders will reach out to Vice President Biden or Secretary of State Kerry or even Gore about entering the primaries, said Garnet Coleman, a Texas state lawmaker and Democratic national committeeman. Even if none of those Democrats were to announce candidacies this fall, some party officials and strategists suggested Biden could be laying the groundwork for an eleventh-hour rescue mission during the winter primaries if Clintons campaign began to implode. Similarly, Kerrys friends say they believe he would hear out party leaders if Sanders appeared likely to capture the nomination and they implored Kerry, who would have to resign as secretary of state, to try to block him. The interest in senior statesmen and stateswomen is partly a reflection of the thin Democratic bench after widespread losses in races for governor, Senate and other offices in 2010 and 2014, which has left the party with relatively few experienced, credible presidential contenders  let alone ones willing to take on Clinton. (The paucity of fresh faces even gave rise to a joking Twitter hashtag: #Dukakis2016, offering up the partys 1988 nominee, former Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.), Still, Biden, Kerry and Gore have lost presidential bids before and are hardly guaranteed party saviors  or more popular than Clinton among important demographic groups like women, African Americans and Hispanics. Indeed, for all of the talk about 2016 fallback plans, Clinton remains the front-runner for the nomination, and her comments Tuesday in an interview with ABC News and in a follow-up message to supporters  saying Im sorry for relying on private email for government business as secretary of state and calling that practice a mistake  may help assuage concerns among some Democrats about her candidacy. But the chatter could continue if Clinton does not quickly regain her footing. You have Democrats beginning to panic about the one thing that a lot of them never worried about, which was Clintons electability in the general election, said Robert Shrum, a veteran strategist who was a senior adviser to Gore and Kerry during their presidential runs. You still have to think of her as the odds-on favorite for the Democratic nomination. But the challenge she faces in the general election is both the trust problem and the likability problem. Shrum recalled how Gores likability suffered in the 2000 campaign, most memorably when he was ridiculed for supposedly having claimed he invented the Internet  but not his fundamental trustworthiness, because theres an assumption that all politicians exaggerate. Several Democrats said Biden and Kerry were especially well-positioned to enter the race late, given their experience, party support, fundraising networks and name recognition. Biden and Kerry are the kind of highly respected, well-known figures that, if he were to jump in the race during the primaries in an emergency kind of way, they could attract a lot of voters very quickly, said Jaime Harrison, chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party. Democrats close to Kerry said he would not consider the white-knight scenario unless drafted  and, indeed, add that he would probably laugh at it. In 2003, they recalled, when Kerry was struggling in the polls, there was chatter that Gen. Wesley Clark would to ride to the rescue so former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean would not capture the nomination. (Clark never became a strong contender.), By all accounts, Kerry loves his current job and is focused on the Iran nuclear agreement now before Congress, which his admirers suggest could make him a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize next month. But his State Department tenure could also make him a strong presidential candidate, if it came to that, they say. He has strengths: He knows the country. He has world stature. He has handled the job of secretary of state extremely well. He beat George Bush in three debates. He prepared Obama for three debates, said John Sasso, a longtime Democratic operative and friend of Kerrys who was a senior adviser to his 2004 campaign. I have no indication Secretary Kerry would ever run again, but I dont think anyone else has more experience in preparing and running for the presidency than Kerry. (Kerry has said recently that he has no plans to run for president, but he also said in February that nobody ever says never.) , Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Sanders, said he believed Democratic restiveness would subside as people learned more about Sanders through campaign events and the televised Democratic debates this fall and winter. As Democratic Party officials see Bernie Sanders mounting strength with voters, I think they will begin to better understand that he will not only be a strong nominee who can help Democrats all across the country win elections, but he actually will be the white knight if they need one, said Devine, who was a past adviser to Kerry and Gore. (A spokeswoman for Gore declined to comment, but Democrats close to him said he was devoted to fighting climate change. Warren, the Massachusetts senator, has said repeatedly that she is not running.) , Several supporters of Clinton said they were confident that her hard work on the campaign trail would ultimately unite the party behind her. The media notwithstanding, I think Hillary is in very strong shape. Shes going to win Iowa and then the nomination and the presidency, said Jerry Crawford, an influential Iowa Democrat who worked on behalf of Kerry in 2004 and is now backing Clinton. Democrats who are ornery and cantankerous as a rule are inclined to say they are for Sanders right now. But when it comes time for them to decide who can win the general election, they will vote for Hillary.]", "Date": "20150909", "Title": "[If Clinton falters, who would be Democrats white knight?]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation-politics/if-clinton-falters-who-would-be-democrats-white-knight/", "Author": "[Patrick Healy]"}
{"Content": "[ If you think the U.S. education system is doing its job, heres a statistic to contemplate: Forty-six percent of Americans believe that humans were created just 6,000 years ago. In other words, the overwhelming scientific evidence in favor of evolution is flat wrong. This alarming, depressing figure comes from a Gallup poll and hasnt changed much over the years. In 1982, 44 percent of Americans believed that God created humans in their current form. The number of Republicans who believe in creationism and discount evolution has increased since 2009 from 47 percent to 56 percent. In other words, no monkeys involved. The Bible is literally true. Noahs Ark was real and saved 7,000 species from drowning. Perhaps you heard about the debate the other night between Bill Nye, TVs Science Guy, and Ken Ham, who founded the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Ky. The museum coins huge amounts of money from tourists eager to see dioramas of human beings and dinosaurs living side by side in perfect harmony. The human being has modern hair and is fully clothed and belted, of course, and is smiling toothily. I think the dinosaur, which looks eerily like the evil velociraptors in Jurassic Park, is also smiling. The Nye-Ham encounter wasnt really a debate because, as Ham said, neither was going to win by changing viewpoints. Ham certainly isnt open to evolution. I know that Gods word is true. Nothing he (Nye) says will cast doubt on that, Ham intoned. Nye reposted that Hams no-evolution theory cant possibly explain why there are now millions of species of flora and fauna. He wondered for example, how two kangaroos from a boat that ended up in Turkey could have hopped over oceans to land in Australia, leaving no fossils behind. The encounter is of little historic note except that school boards all over the country are in real debate over whether creationism should be taught to children. During one of the interminable GOP debates before the 2008 presidential election, the 10 candidates on stage were asked if they believe in evolution. Three raised their hands indicating they did not: Tom Tancredo, Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee. Huckabee, a televangelist who has his own political show on the Fox network, later said the question was utterly silly. None of the candidates, he said, was running to be eighth-grade science teacher. Huckabee has suddenly emerged as one of the leading GOP presidential candidates for 2016 since New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie self-destructed. He says the earth may be more than 6,000 years old and may even be billions of years old. But we dont know. He insists he does know that one God created it all. President Obama says he is against teaching creationism as an alternative to evolution to children because it is religion-based. He calls science the never-ending search for knowledge and truth. He says science holds the key to our planets survival (climate change). And he says it is time to put science at the top of our agenda. Huckabee and many millions like him do not agree. They want belief at the top of the agenda, or rather, they want their form of belief. Their belief that America can do no wrong. Belief that their God loves this country more than others. Their belief that scientific findings can be cherry picked and denied. Their belief that parents may decide what truths their children are taught and which are inconvenient. Forty-six percent of Americans refuse to accept that human life evolved from lesser animals in a process that took billions of years. According to the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication, only 63 percent of Americans believe that climate change is happening although 97 percent of climate experts are convinced climate change is real and human activity is the cause, according to The Consensus Project.

{"Content": "[ If youre looking for intrigue in Seattle City Council elections this year, theres at least one place to turn: the race between Councilmember Mike OBrien and engineering consultant Albert Shen. Four years after a pair of open seats drew nearly a dozen candidates, the elections this time around are widely seen as sleepy. Few strong challengers have emerged to oppose four incumbents up for re-election. Two of the incumbents, Sally Bagshaw and Nick Licata, have only one opponent and thus wont appear on the Aug. 6 primary election ballot. A third, longtime council member and former Council President Richard Conlin, has received most major endorsements in his re-election bid against socialist Kshama Sawant and Amazon.com employee Brian Carver. That leaves OBrien, a first-term incumbent, as the most vulnerable member. Shen, running on a pro-business platform, has received several endorsements and has raised more than $130,000  more than OBriens nearly $94,500., Poet David Ishii is also running. But local political consultants note that even the OBrien race has struggled for attention in a year when the city has been focused on a crowded field for mayor. OBrien, Shen, Ishii, OBrien, a 45-year-old financial officer and former local Sierra Club chairman, is perhaps best known as Mayor Mike McGinns closest ally on the council. He has carved out a name for himself, however, championing bills  to ban plastic bags and create an opt-out program for yellow-pages phone-book deliveries to save paper, and crafting a ballot measure to establish public financing of council elections. Im really proud of what Ive accomplished, said OBrien, who was first elected four years ago, and I really feel like Im just getting started. Shen, 46, who serves on the Seattle Community Colleges board of trustees and runs a civil-engineering company, has criticized the incumbents relationship with the mayor, including by distributing a flier with an illustration of OBrien literally in McGinns pocket. He also argued that OBrien has failed to adequately include the business community in policy discussions. Process is important. We have to get business involved, said Shen, who is endorsed by the political arm of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce. Specifically, Shen noted the $500,000 settlement the city paid publishers of the yellow-pages directories that sued over the opt-out law., OBrien said he was disappointed with that legal outcome but that the opt-out law was well worth it. In two years, we have reduced 1,000 tons of paper and saved the city two-thirds of the $200,000 we pay (annually) to recycle yellow pages, he said. OBrien said he hasnt heard Shen articulate a specific case against him. Im still struggling to understand what he would do differently and why hes in this race, OBrien said. One of their differences is on affordable housing. OBrien, who played a key role in establishing more affordable housing in South Lake Union as part of a rezone, believes it is worth the citys money to build such housing in more expensive neighborhoods because thats where the jobs are. Shen thinks public money would be best spent in areas where more housing can be built for the same cost. Another difference is on the proposed Sodo basketball arena. OBrien supported the plan, while Shen said he had serious concerns about its location and the use of public financing. Ishii, who turns 57 on Thursday, has not mounted a serious campaign. His website blares Chers I Got You Babe and turns the cursor into a fountain of bubbles or hearts, depending on which section you click into. Conlin, Sawant, Carver, Conlin has served on the  Seattle City Council for 16 years, tied for the longest on the  current council., The 65-year-old former director of the Environment Division at Metrocenter YMCA has worked on a variety of issues, including the plastic-bag ban and the parks levy, first approved by voters in 2008, which directs more money to city parks. If re-elected, he said, he wants to focus on overseeing planned light-rail projects to Lynnwood and the Eastside, work on a 2016 package for additional rail lines and ensure that development occurs around the transit stations. I have both the experience to know how to make things happen and the fresh ideas to make them happen, he said. Carver, 34, accused Conlin of not leading on big issues and being too conservative for Seattle. Specifically, he cited the incumbents votes against the proposed Sodo arena and requiring businesses to provide paid sick leave. Conlin was the only no vote on the latter, saying more study was needed. I think our council needs to be doing more to lead in areas that are really important for Seattle, said Carver, arguing for more investments in early learning, more oversight of the police force and more protection of neighborhoods. Sawant, 40, who ran as a socialist alternative against state House Speaker Frank Chopp last year, is running this time on a platform with three main proposals: a tax on millionaires, a $15 citywide minimum wage and rent control mandating that rents can rise no more than inflation. Seattle has become unaffordable to working people, said Sawant, an economics professor at Seattle Central Community College who has gotten endorsements from The Stranger newspaper and several labor unions. The majority of people are well to the left of the City Council, and were running to represent their interests. Specifically, she said Conlin has been a poster boy for out of touch representation and hostile to the homeless. Conlin said the council is prevented by law from establishing a millionaires tax or rent control. He said he is open to exploring an increase in the minimum wage, however. Brian M.

{"Content": "[ In a former colonial mansion in Jamaica, politicians huddle to discuss trying to ease marijuana laws in the land of the late reggae musician and cannabis evangelist Bob Marley. In Morocco, one of the worlds top producers of the concentrated pot known as hashish, two leading political parties want to legalize its cultivation, at least for medical and industrial use. And in Mexico City, the vast metropolis of a country ravaged by horrific cartel bloodshed, lawmakers have proposed a new plan to let stores sell the drug. From the Americas to Europe to North Africa and beyond, the marijuana-legalization movement is gaining unprecedented traction  a nod to successful efforts in Colorado, Washington state and the small South American nation of Uruguay, which in December became the first country to approve nationwide pot legalization. Leaders long weary of the drug wars violence and futility have been emboldened by changes in U.S. policy, even in the face of opposition from their own conservative populations. Some are eager to try an approach that focuses on public health instead of prohibition, and some see a potentially lucrative industry in cannabis regulation. A number of countries are saying, Weve been curious about this, but we didnt think we could go this route, said Sam Kamin, a University of Denver law professor who helped write Colorados marijuana regulations. Its harder for the U.S. to look at other countries and say, You cant legalize, you cant decriminalize, because its going on here. Thats largely because the White House is more open to drug-war alternatives.  President Obama recently told The New Yorker magazine that he considers marijuana less dangerous to consumers than alcohol, and he said its important that the legalization experiments in Washington and Colorado go forward, especially because blacks are arrested for the drug at a greater rate than whites, despite similar levels of use. His administration also has criticized U.S. drug-war-driven incarceration rates and announced that it will let banks do business with licensed marijuana operations, which have largely been cash-only because federal law forbids financial institutions from processing pot-related transactions. Such actions underscore how the official U.S. position has changed in recent years. In 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice announced it wouldnt target medical-marijuana patients. In August, the agency said it wouldnt interfere with the laws in Colorado and Washington, which regulate the growth and sale of taxed pot for recreational use. Anxiety over U.S. reprisals has previously doused reform efforts in Jamaica, including a 2001 attempt to approve private use of marijuana by adults. Given Americas evolution, the discussion has changed, said Delano Seiveright, director of Ganja Law Reform Coalition-Jamaica. Last summer eight lawmakers, evenly split between the ruling Peoples National Party and the opposition Jamaica Labor Party, met with  Ethan Nadelmann, head of the nonprofit Drug Policy Alliance, a pro-legalization group based in New York, and local cannabis crusaders at a luxury hotel in Kingstons financial district and discussed the next steps, including trying to decriminalize pot possession. Officials are concerned about the roughly 300 young men each week who get criminal records for possessing small amounts of ganja. Others in the debt-shackled nation worry about losing out on tourism dollars: For many, weed is synonymous with Marleys home country, where it has long been used as a medicinal herb by families, including as a cold remedy, and as a spiritual sacrament by Rastafarians. Influential politicians are increasingly taking up the idea of loosening pot restrictions. Jamaicas health minister recently said he was fully on board with medical marijuana. The cooperation on this issue far outweighs what Ive seen before, Seiveright said., In Morocco, lawmakers have been inspired by laws in Washington, Colorado and Uruguay to push forward their longstanding desire to allow cannabis to be grown for medical and industrial uses. They say such a law would help small farmers who survive on the crop but live at the mercy of drug lords and police attempts to eradicate it. Security policies arent solving the problem because its an economic and social issue, said Mehdi Bensaid, a legislator with the Party of Authenticity and Modernity, a political party closely allied with the countrys king. We think this crop can become an important economic resource for Morocco and the citizens of this region. In October, lawmakers from Uruguay, Mexico and Canada converged on Colorado for a firsthand look at how that states law is being implemented. They toured a medical-marijuana dispensary and sniffed bar-coded marijuana plants as the dispensarys owner gave  a tour. Mexico has outlets like that, but guarded by armed men, Mexican Congressman Ren Fujiwara Montelongo said afterward. Theres no general push to legalize marijuana in Mexico, where tens of thousands have died in cartel violence in recent years. But in liberal Mexico City, legislators on Thursday introduced a measure to let stores sell up to 5grams of pot. Its supported by the mayor but could set up a fight with the conservative federal government. Rather than continue fighting a war that makes no sense, now we are joining a cutting-edge process, said Jorge Castaneda, a former Mexican foreign minister. Opponents to legalization worry that pot could become heavily commercialized or that increased access will increase youth use. They say the other sides political victories have reawakened their cause. Theres been a real hunger from people abroad to find out how we got ourselves into this mess in the first place and how to avoid it, said Kevin Sabet of Project Smart Approaches to Marijuana. A number of U.S. states are considering whether to try for recreational laws. Voters in Alaska will have their say on a legalization measure this summer. Oregon voters could also weigh in this year, and in California, drug-reform groups are deciding whether to push a ballot measure in 2014 or wait until 2016s presidential election. Abroad, activists are pushing the issue before a United Nations summit in 2016. While some European countries, including Spain, Belgium and the Czech Republic, have taken steps over the years to liberalize pot laws in the face of international treaties that limit drug production to medical and research purposes, the Netherlands, famous for its pot coffee shops, has started to pull back, calling on cities to close shops near schools and ban sales to tourists. There is, however, an effort afoot to legitimize the growing of cannabis sold in the coffee shops. While its been legal to sell pot, its not to grow it, so shops must turn to the black market for their supply, which may wind up seized in a raid. In Latin America and the Caribbean, where some countries have decriminalized possession of small amounts of drugs, from cocaine to marijuana, there is significant public opposition to further legalization. But it is, nevertheless, on the table. Current or former presidents in Colombia, Mexico, Guatemala and Brazil have called for a re-evaluation of or end to the drug war, a chorus echoed by Argentinas drug czar, Juan Carlos Molina, a Roman Catholic priest who has long served in the nations drug-wasted slums. Molina said hes following orders from President Cristina Fernandez to change the governments focus from enforcing drug laws against young people to getting them into treatment., The pace of change has put U.S. legalization activists in heavy demand at conferences in countries weighing their drug laws, including Chile, Poland and the Netherlands. The advocates, including those who worked on the efforts in Washington and Colorado, have advised foreign lawmakers and activists on how to build campaigns.

{"Content": "[ In a possible preview of a 2016 presidential race, former Florida governor Jeb Bush took a swipe at Hillary Clinton on Wednesday evening as he stumped for Republican candidates in the vital swing state of Colorado. Bush was in Colorado one day after former President Bill Clinton departed the state and a little more than a week after Hillary Clinton was last there  an indication of both the intensity of the states top race pitting Democratic Sen Mark Udall against his Republican challenger, Rep. Cory Gardner, as well as Colorados oversized role in recent presidential elections. During a rally for the Republican ticket at a county fairground in this conservative Denver suburb, Bush, without mentioning her name, alluded to comments Hillary Clinton made while stumping for Democrats on Friday. This last week I saw something that was breathtaking, a candidate  a former secretary of state who was campaigning in Massachusetts  where she said that dont let them tell you that businesses create jobs. Bush paused as the audience booed. Well the problem in America today is that not enough jobs are being created, (but) they are created by business, Bush continued. Clinton said the statement was a slip of the tongue, but Republicans eager to tarnish her image before a 2016 campaign have used it to mock her all week. Bush, a former Florida governor and a brother of former President George W. Bush, is one of many Republicans mulling a 2016 run. Another expected 2016 Republican contender, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, will campaign with Gardner and the GOPs gubernatorial candidate in Colorado, former Rep. Bob Beauprez, on Thursday. Bush is fluent in Spanish and seen by many Republicans as his partys best candidate to reach out to the fast-growing Hispanic population, which is trending Democratic. Earlier Wednesday, he appeared with Gardner and Beauprez at Denvers Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, where he took questions from Spanish-language media about immigration. The former Florida governor warned against President Barack Obamas expected executive action to limit deportations, promised for some time shortly after the election. Instead, Bush said Congress needs to pass a bill and that a newly Republican Congress would solve the nations immigration woes  although the Republican-controlled House refused to vote on a major immigration bill this year. The constitution requires Congress to pass laws, not the president, Bush said in Spanish, contrasting that with some Latin American strongmens ability to implement laws by fiat. If Obama acts unilaterally on immigration, Bush warned, it will be harder to do it the appropriate way.]", "Date": "20141030", "Title": "[Jeb Bush swipes at Hillary Clinton in Colorado]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/jeb-bush-swipes-at-hillary-clinton-in-colorado/", "Author": "[NICHOLAS RICCARDI]"}
{"Content": "[ In a vast banquet room at a DoubleTree Suites in Tukwila, former Somali Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed Mohamed made his way down the aisle. The crowd of several hundred  men in dark jackets on one side, women in brightly colored headscarves on the other  had been waiting for hours. As their ancestral national anthem began to play, they leapt to their feet, singing along, clapping and waving little Somali flags bearing a white star on a background of sky blue. In the crowd was Abdulkadir Jangeli Aden Mohamud, who had greeted the former prime minister at the airport and had him to his Renton home the next morning for breakfast. They had nothing less than the future of Somalia to discuss, and Mohamud, once head of Somalias development bank and more recently the owner of a local MaidPro janitorial franchise, was poised to help the former leader carry out his agenda. Now, the former prime minister, ousted in December amid a standoff with the president, took the stage, raised his fist and urged the crowd to be part of history. In 2016, Somalia is supposed to hold its first democratic election in more than 40 years. There are obstacles, to be sure, among them attempted disruption by the extremist Islamic terrorist group al-Shabaab. But if it comes off, the election could bring a measure of stability and order to one of the most chaotic, corrupt and violent countries in the world. Washington state could play a vital role. Its Somali community is thought to be the third largest in the U.S. after Minnesota and Ohio, and to number anywhere from roughly 13,000 (according to the latest Census figures, which tend to underreport immigrant populations) to 30,000 (as estimated by community leaders). Mohamed, among others, believes Seattle-area Somalis  indeed all of the countrys emigrants around the world  should get a vote. And he wants them to pressure the Somali parliament, as well as influential U.S. officials, to make that happen. Some have taken up his call. Meeting in living rooms and suburban malls, teleconferencing with their compatriots around the globe, they are brainstorming about people to talk to and petitions they might start. You wouldnt necessarily know it from their current occupations, but back in their homeland, many had impressive, even exalted, pedigrees. Its a shattered country,  said Mohamud, the former banker and amateur painter who came to the U.S. in 1989, as his country was on the brink of civil war. We need to stitch every piece together and make reconciliation. For that to happen, he and other Somalis say, the diaspora must become involved. That was the message of former Prime Minister Mohamed, who spent a decade in Canada before returning to Africa. Particularly in the West, he said in a Seattle Times interview, Somali refugees have come to know the benefits of democracy, peace and stability. With as many as 20 percent of native Somalis spread around the world, support for the candidates of their liking  financial and electoral  is crucial. If they are allowed to vote, they would be more inclined to open up their wallets, said David Shinn, a lecturer in African affairs at George Washington University and a former ambassador to Ethiopia. That would make Seattlean important campaign stop for Somali politicians. Mohamed, who isnt making his personal political aspirations known, isnt the first to come here. Fadumo Dayib, a Harvard University fellow who is braving death threats and challenging cultural mores as she seeks to become Somalias first female president, made a stop in Seattle in April. Just in case youre wondering whos going to be the future prime minister, youre talking to him, Dualeh Hersi said during the May event at the Tukwila DoubleTree. Hersi, 46, related that he is a nephew of Siad Barre, the former president and military dictator who ruled Somalia for decades before being ousted by a civil war in 1991. As rebels encroached upon Barres villa, Hersis family made a split-second decision to join a convoy headed for Kenya. He was 22 and a recent graduate of Somali National University. Eventually making his way to the U.S. he took computer classes while supporting himself with a series of menial jobs. He now works as a program manager for Amazon. I cry in my heart when I see the way Somali people are treated around the world, he said, explaining why he might give up a comfortable life here to go back to a place he calls a black hole. While the elite hide in fancy hotels and houses surrounded by tall walls, he said, hundreds of thousands are still crammed into refugee camps. He said that will likely only change with the help of Somalis who have benefited from opportunities abroad. Its in my blood, he added. The Barre connection would have been a liability at one point, but Hersi believes that has changed after all this time, especially as he and others once connected to the regime are voicing support for democracy. When Hersi might go back is uncertain. Yet, he has already tested the waters. In December, he traveled to Mogadishu to make a pitch for a new cabinet position that would improve the countrys shoddy telecommunications. The government wasnt interested, he said, and he returned to Seattle. This back and forth to Somalia isnt unique to Hersi. The diaspora and the population inside the country are so interconnected, said Matt Bryden, speaking by phone from Nairobi, where he heads Sahan, a think tank focusing on the Horn of Africa. Inside a little storefront in SeaTac or a nonprofit in Seattle, you might find a recent Somali member of parliament, an entrepreneur with investments in Mogadishu or a behind-the-scenes player with deep political ties to his African compatriots. Talking in his Renton home, with the curtains drawn  African-style, against the afternoon sun  Mohamud recounted his departure from Somalia in 1989, as a civil war was beginning to brew. You couldnt just quit a job in the Barre administration, related the former official, dressed on this day in a navy suit with a green handkerchief tucked neatly into the breast pocket. You had to leave the country. He landed in the Washington, D.C. area, where he lived for 16 years. When several of his five children made their way to the Seattle area, he moved here. Despite dealing with kidney failure and dialysis, he remains active in Somali affairs. When he and Mohamed met for breakfast, Mohamud recalled, the former prime minister asked for his support. A considerable amount of tact was involved. He said, You are not joining us. We are joining you,  Mohamud recalled. The former prime minister was alluding to a political party Mohamud had helped form in 2011. The purpose, he said, was to create a culture of parties that would supplant the culture of corruption and clan-based rivalries that reigned in Somalia. Called Hiil Qaran and composed of Somalis around the world, it has no ideology, he said; Somali politics havent reached that point. Instead, he called its mission patriotic the building of a democratic republic. Mohamud now chairs Hiil Qaran, which has maybe 300 members. Thats not a lot, but apparently it carries enough clout to be courted by a prominent politician. Or perhaps it is Mohamud who has the clout. Asked if he has political aspirations himself, the former banker demurred. But I may be a kingmaker, he said. He later thought better of the boast and said he was joking. Yet, he noted his influence as a commentator on websites and radio shows targeting the international Somali community. His wife, Hamdi Abdulle, is also a force to be reckoned with. She serves as executive director of the Somali Youth and Family Club, a Renton-based nonprofit. She said she was pleased by the talk of reconciliation during the former prime ministers visit, and gave a speech supporting womens rights at the DoubleTree event. But she did not sit on stage. They were, she said pointedly, all men, including my husband. She also said there was an expectation that women would sit apart from men. Abdulle, wearing a vivid black and red headscarf as she talked with a reporter, observes some traditional customs. Still, she said, I dont want anybody to dictate to me where to sit. You might think she would be susceptible to a womans bid for president, but she was critical of Dayibs Seattle appearance, which took place at an Eritrean community center  a foreign venue for local Somalis, according to Abdulle. That may be why only about 30 people turned out. Nourah Yonous, a 28-year-old Somali woman, invited Dayib here. A recent transplant to Seattle, she grew up in Tanzania and went to college in California, where she studied feminist theory. Moving here for a job at a local nonprofit immersed her for the first time in a big Somali community. Over lunch at a Chinese restaurant near her work in Rainier Valley, she confessed she finds it tricky to navigate the communitys mores. Still, Yonous, whose very appearance raises eyebrows  her mass of curly hair falls to her shoulders uncovered  declared her intention to support Dayib as much as she can. For the first time in our history we have a Somali woman candidate, she said. And the incredulous reaction by some merely underscores for her the need to press on. It also suggests the diaspora, if allowed to vote, will have an unpredictable influence. There are many diasporas, observed Nairobis Bryden, citing one in the West, one in Asia and one in Somalias neighboring countries. The diaspora in the West might be more inclined toward a secular, multiparty system, he speculated. Yet, he added: Even in the West, theres a lot of division  Some of the most rabid, pro-clan propaganda comes from outside Somalia because they dont have to suffer the consequences. (A smattering of al-Shabaab recruits have also come from the West, including at least a couple from Seattle, although the terrorist groups pull abroad has diminished, according to Somali observers.), Whatever way they lean, Somali emigrants wont get a chance to weigh in unless they win the vote in Somalia. Thats something that Abdulhakim Hashi is working on. The 54-year-old, who jokes that his eight children have given him a clan of his own, left Somalia in the 1980s to study at the University of Amsterdam. With a mother-in-law in the Seattle area, he came here in 1998 and now runs a nationwide business  wiring money to Africa, selling insurance and preparing tax returns  out of an odd little SeaTac building in the shadow of a mall featuring a cavernous Somali grocery and restaurant. In 2000, when a peace conference in Djibouti established a transitional government, Hashi said, he went back to serve in parliament. But warlordism and chaos continued to reign. He returned to Seattle. He still visits Somalia, in part to work on a bank he and other investors are trying to get off the ground. On one such trip in February, he said, he attended the founding meeting of Mohameds Forum of Unity and Democracy. The memory is tinged with sadness for Hashi. A few days later, he lost a good friend in an al-Shabaab hotel bombing that killed about 25 people. Mohameds visit to Seattle in May roused Hashi to action. He became part of a local task force that is discussing ways to get the voices of the diaspora heard, including a possible petition drive among Somali immigrants, asking the U.S. State Department to intervene. Donald Teitelbaum, the State Departments deputy assistant secretary for East African Affairs, does not sound so inclined. I think the decisions on the specifics of the voting is something for the Somalis to decide. With President Obamas trip over the weekend to neighboring Ethiopia and Kenya, the fate of Somalia is likely on his mind, but he may be more focused on ending al-Shabaab violence than shaping the next election. Amid furious political maneuvering now going on in Mogadishu, President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud has said he thinks security concerns will make a one-person one-vote election difficult. Local Somalis are watching all this carefully. Whatever their differences, they seem to agree on this sentiment, as expressed by Hashi: We need Somalia to join the rank of civilized nations.]", "Date": "20150726", "Title": "[Seattle-area Somalis seek to shape politics back home]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/seattle-area-somalis-seek-to-shape-politics-back-home/", "Author": "[Nina Shapiro]"}
{"Content": "[ In one of his final acts as governor, Democrat Martin OMalley announced Wednesday that he will commute the sentences of four death-row inmates to life in prison without parole. Two years ago, the General Assembly abolished the death penalty, leaving five inmates on death row. One of them, John Booth-El, died in prison this year. The governor said he had met or spoken with many of the relatives of the people killed by the inmates. Some victim family members and prosecutors were upset with OMalleys decision. OMalley said that if he didnt commute the sentences the legal process would needlessly and callously subject survivors, and the people of Maryland, to the ordeal of an endless appeals process, with unpredictable twists and turns, and without any hope of finality or closure. None of the executions was imminent because the state didnt have a procedure to carry one out. OMalley, who is considering running for president in 2016, will leave office next month after two terms, the limit in Maryland. The governor is a Catholic and longtime opponent of capital punishment. We would like to thank Gov. OMalley for taking what was a tough and courageous moral decision, Gary Proctor, one of the attorneys for death-row inmate Heath Burch, said in a statement. It was indeed time that Marylands machinery of death was consigned to the history books. Mary Frances Moore, whose father and stepmother were fatally stabbed by Burch in 1995 in Capitol Heights, said she was devastated by the governors decision. I think he was hoping I would give him the OK on it, to give him life without parole, and I didnt give him that, Moore, 71, said Wednesday. She fears a future governor could grant parole to Burch. Matthew Maciarello, the Wicomico County states attorney, said OMalley met with Dottie Atkinson  the mother of Edward Atkinson, who was killed in a 1997 robbery and murder by Jody Lee Miles in Mardela Springs on Marylands Eastern Shore. Maciarello, who attended the meeting, said while the family believes death was the appropriate sentence, they understand the political and legal realities. They believe that the actions taken by the governor will provide a degree of closure that could not be achieved through protracted litigation, Maciarello said. The family requested privacy and asked him to make a statement for them, he said. Miles attorney, Robert Biddle, argued in a letter to OMalley last month that the governor should not commute his clients sentence because Miles deserves the opportunity to argue in court for parole. Biddle said Wednesday that Miles would not agree to the commutation, arguing that his client deserves a chance at parole because of his remorse, his outstanding record in prison and other factors. Baltimore County States Attorney Scott Shellenberger, a death penalty supporter, criticized the governors move. Two death-row inmates, Anthony Grandison and Vernon Evans, were convicted in the 1983 contract killing in Baltimore County of two witnesses who were scheduled to testify against Grandison in a federal drug case. Death was the decision of the jury. These sentences were lawfully imposed and upheld numerous times on appeal, Shellenberger said in a statement. The governor should not be using his last days in office to show any mercy to these cold, calculating killers. Gov.-elect Larry Hogan, a Republican who takes office Jan. 21, said he wasnt going to second-guess the decision. There is only one governor at a time, and Im not in a place to second-guess what is probably one of the most difficult decisions a governor may have to make, Hogan said in a statement. Only five Maryland inmates were executed since the death penalty was reinstated in 1978. The last execution was in 2005 under Republican Gov. Robert Ehrlich.

{"Content": "[ In the 1960s, economics student Dilma Rousseff joined her first militant group opposing the military dictatorship in Brazil. In 1970, she was captured, tortured and tossed in prison for nearly three years. Jos Serra also was active in student politics, leading the left-leaning National Student Union and attracting the interest of the military. Just before the 1964 military coup, he fled the country. These former militants, who entered mainstream politics decades ago, are the front-runners in Brazils presidential election Sunday. Expected to finish a distant third in a nine-candidate field is Green Party candidate Marina Silva. While the leading candidates political histories might give U.S. voters pause, its mostly a nonissue for Brazilians. Thats the past. I dont criticize.  Those who are to be criticized are the military leaders who took power without a mandate, said Paulo Sotero, director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. Rousseff, 62, and Serra, 68, the former governor of So Paulo, share other similarities: Both come from first-generation immigrant families, studied economics, are skilled administrators and have spent years in public service. There is one big difference: Rousseff is the hand-picked candidate of President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, who is riding a vast wave of popularity in this ascendant country of 201 million. Lula, who cant seek re-election after serving two consecutive terms but could run again in four years, has presided over economic growth, when 24 million Brazilians moved out of poverty and the middle class grew to 103 million. Despite twinges of new scandal in his administration, so long are Lulas coattails that some analysts expect Rousseff, the presidents former chief of staff, to win the election outright without having to go to a second round Oct. 31. Brazils new president will take over Jan. 1. A victory by Rousseff would make her the first woman president of Latin Americas largest country, a major U.S. trading partner. A Datafolha poll released Thursday showed Rousseffs lead had slipped a few points from its peak to 52 percent  compared with Serras 31 percent  but that would still give her the percentage of valid votes she needs to escape a second round, which analysts say she would win handily. Accusations that Lulas chief of staff, Erenice Guerra, also a former aide to Rousseff, was involved in a kickback scheme prompted Guerra to resign and may be having an impact on Rousseffs lead. Rousseff, who represents the coalition Para o Brasil seguir mudando (So that Brazil Keeps on Changing) headed by Lulas Workers Party, has positioned herself as the candidate best able to continue his market-friendly policies. Indeed, many analysts say what Brazilians want is more of the same: brisk economic growth along with more equitable income distribution. Brazil also has discovered huge deep-water oil reserves and will host the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympic Games, events that are starting to spur an array of public-works projects. Brazil is on a roll for the next four or five years, and its very difficult to see anything that would derail that prospect, said Paulo Vieira da Cunha, a partner in New York-based Tandem Global Partners and the former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Brazil. During the campaign, Serra, from the coalition O Brasil pode mais (Brazil Can Do More) thats headed by his Brazilian Social Democracy Party, has tried to portray himself as the heir to Lulas policies without much success. There is a clear feeling among the population that (Rousseff) is prepared to continue Lulas work, said Jeanine Pires, former head of Embratur, the government tourism-promotion agency, and now director of Brasil 2016. She knows the countrys problems well and what it takes to solve them. Shes very intelligent, a strong woman and very prepared as an executive. Unlike Serra, Rousseff has never held elective office. Her political past, however, has provided an intriguing back story to the campaign. Lula has said, What I most admire in Dilma is the story of her life. Born to a Bulgarian immigrant father and a Brazilian teacher in the state of Minas Gerais, Rousseff had a comfortable childhood, went to private school, belonged to the Minas Tennis Club and mingled with the elite of Belo Horizonte. Her teenage years were a time of political foment in Brazil and she joined her first clandestine group as a 16-year-old. As the government took a turn to the left, the military seized power in 1964 and thus began an era when students were forbidden to organize and removed from universities because of their political activities; the media, literature and the arts were censured; the constitution was suspended; and opponents were stripped of their civil rights, jailed and tortured. As a member of the Revolutionary Armed Vanguard Palmares, Rousseff and her former husband, fellow militant Claudio Galena, moved frequently from house to house as a police crackdown intensified, according to the biography on her campaign website. Bank robberies and thefts to bankroll weapons purchases were standard operating procedure for many of the guerrilla groups of the time. How central a role Rousseff played in the armed resistance is a topic of debate. In complaints she filed after her release, she said she was beaten, punched and subjected to electric shocks while imprisoned. After her 1973 release, she moved to Porto Alegre, where she resumed her studies and began working in state government. The military dictatorship ended in 1979, and Rousseff and Serra  who stayed abroad for 14 years  took advantage of a 1979 amnesty law to return to political life. Rousseff, a lymphatic-cancer survivor, is described as tough, smart and hyperfocused by those who know her. Shes also famous for being short-fused, no-nonsense and very direct, Sotero said.]", "Date": "20101002", "Title": "[Former student radicals poised to lead Brazil]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/former-student-radicals-poised-to-lead-brazil/", "Author": "[Mimi Whitefield]"}
{"Content": "[ In whats becoming a seasonal tradition nearly as predictable as the pumpkin-spice latte, the name of Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz has again been floated as a potential presidential candidate. Starbucks is staying officially mum, but state Democratic operatives said theyre skeptical, and theres been no sign that the politically engaged coffee titan is planning to stir the 2016 presidential pot. Update: Howard Schultz says he has no intention to run for president, The latest cup of chatter was brewed up in the Sunday New York Times, where columnist Maureen Dowd wrote that potent friends of Americas lord of latte have been pressing him to join the Democratic primary. The buzz spread on the Internet, with conservative news aggregator Drudge Report playing up the potential challenge to front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton. Starbucks wouldnt comment and did not make Schultz available for an interview this week. Schultz has repeatedly batted down such rumors, which also arose before the 2012 election. In February, he told Time magazine he was not interested and lacked the correct temperament to run for office. I dont think that is a solution. I dont think it ends well, he told the magazine. Jaxon Ravens, chair of the Washington State Democratic Party, said he has not heard any buzz about Schultz considering a presidential bid. Its not hitting the radar, he said. Since reclaiming the helm of a struggling Starbucks in 2008, Schultz has increasingly thrown the heft of the coffee giant behind social and policy issues dear to his heart, from gridlock in Washington, D.C. to the plight of returning veterans, even as he turned the company around. Its been a rare departure from the typical corporate script for the CEO of a publicly traded company, and analysts say that investors go along with it because Starbucks results have been spectacular. Some of its well-publicized moves  such as an initiative to subsidize college for legions of U.S. baristas, cast against the backdrop of rising inequality and mounting college costs  have helped make Starbucks more attractive as an employer. More recently, the company launched a campaign to employ and train disadvantaged youth. It hasnt always gone well: A bid in March to encourage baristas to talk about race relations in the empires coffee shops was widely panned. Schultz is not known for being particularly involved in politics in Washington state. He has donated periodically to Democratic candidates. He hosted a fundraiser at his home for John Edwards 2008 presidential campaign. After Edwards flamed out in an infidelity scandal, Schultz donated to Clinton and Barack Obamas 2008 campaigns. Its not clear the coffee magnate would even have a firm Washington state constituency. He is reviled by some local sports fans for selling the Seattle SuperSonics to a group of Oklahoma businessmen in 2006. The team moved to Oklahoma City two years later. He would have a hard time carrying Washington because a lot of people think he is the one who lost the Sonics, said Paul Berendt, a former state Democratic Party chairman and Clinton supporter. Ravens called Schultz smart and accomplished but said, Weve got some great people running already and the clock is ticking. Many Democratic activists in the state already are lining up behind Clinton or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is visiting Seattle for a pair of political rallies Saturday. Ravens said hes heard no hue and cry among Democrats for a billionaire business executive to lead their partys ticket.

{"Content": "[ Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is promising the new Republican majority will quickly resurrect Keystone XL pipeline legislation killed by Democrats, potentially setting up an early 2015 veto confrontation with President Barack Obama. I look forward to the new Republican majority taking up and passing the Keystone jobs bill early in the new year, the Kentucky Republican said Tuesday, shortly after the bill fell one vote short of the 60 votes needed to advance. He was joined by incoming Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who said the fight wasnt over. The vote was a blow to Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La. who had forced the issue onto the Senate agenda, and who faces difficult odds in a Dec. 6 runoff election against Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy. Im going to fight for the people of my state until the day that I leave, and I hope that will not be soon, she said. Republicans are likely to have enough votes to assure the bills passage in January, when they will have at least 53 seats  54 if Cassidy wins the Louisiana runoff. If you look at new Congress, you can count four more (GOP seats) right away, and there may be others, Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota, the lead sponsor of the bill, said after the 59-41 vote Tuesday. You can see were well over 60. Hoeven acknowledged that Republicans would need 67 votes to override a veto, but said one possibility is to include Keystone in a larger energy package that may not prompt a veto threat. The vote was one of the last acts of this Senate controlled by the Democrats. It is expected to complete its work by mid-December. Cassidy, Landrieus Republican opponent, said Louisiana families need better jobs, better wages and better benefits, and the pipeline would provide them. Democratic divisions were on vivid display in a bill that pitted environmentalists against energy advocates. While Obama opposes the measure, likely 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton has repeatedly refused to take a position. Most recently, her spokesman did not respond to two requests over the weekend to do so. The project would move oil from Canada into the United States and eventually to the Texas Gulf Coast. Supporters say it would create jobs and ease American dependence on Middle East oil. A government environmental impact statement also predicts that a pipeline would result in less damage to the climate than moving the same oil by rail. Critics argue that the drilling itself is environmentally harmful, and said much of the Canadian crude would be exported with little or no impact on Americas drive for energy stability. At the White House, press secretary Josh Earnest said the measure is something the president doesnt support because the president believes that this is something that should be determined through the State Department and the regular process that is in place to evaluate projects like this. After the vote, five people were handcuffed and led off by Capitol police outside the Senate chamber after breaking into loud yowls. One was wearing what appeared to be Native American beads and feathers in his hair.

{"Content": "[ ISTANBUL  , Confronted with widespread protests two summers ago, Prime Minister Recep Erdogan of Turkey ordered a harsh crackdown and tarnished the demonstrators as traitors and spies. Faced with a corruption inquiry focused on his inner circle, he responded by purging the police and judiciary. So when Erdogan, now president, suffered a stinging electoral defeat in June that left his party without a majority in Parliament and seemingly dashed his hopes of establishing an executive presidency, Turks wondered how he would respond. Many say they have their answer: a new war. As Turkey resumes military operations against the separatist Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, analysts see a calculated strategy for Erdogans Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party to regain its parliamentary majority in new elections. Having delayed formation of a coalition government, analysts say, Erdogan is buttressing his partys chances of winning new elections by appealing to Turkish nationalists opposed to self-determination for the Kurdish minority. Parallel to the military operations against the Kurds has been an effort to undermine the political side of the Kurdish movement, by associating it with the violence of the PKK, which has also seemed eager to return to fighting. Turkey battled the group for three decades at a cost of about 40,000 lives before a fragile peace process began in 2013. The overall assumption is that President Erdogan wants to create the conditions so the result of June 7 can be overturned, so that he can run the country from the presidency, said Suat Kiniklioglu, a former lawmaker from Erdogans party and executive director of the Center for Strategic Communication, a research organization in Ankara.  The Justice and Development Party, known as the AKP, recently began conducting nationwide polls to see how it might fare in snap elections, which could be held as soon as November. Many analysts say that after weeks of stalled coalition talks involving the AKP and three opposition parties, new elections are likely. And at a time of crisis, Turkish voters, experts say, could well turn again to Erdogan and the AKP. A voter survey released Wednesday by a widely cited Turkish pollster found that Erdogans party could regain a parliamentary majority if elections were held today. He is going for early elections, said Henri Barkey, director of the Middle East program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and an expert on Turkey. In any society when there is a crisis, people rally under the flag, even if they dont support the leader. In this instance, Mr. Erdogan is playing the nationalism card for his own benefit. In addition to domestic political concerns, analysts said, Erdogan is worried about the growing military strength of the PKK, whose military affiliate has been working closely with the United States in northern Syria to resist and repel advances by the Islamic State group. The bombing campaign against the PKK, these analysts say, is intended to weaken it. The resumption of war with the PKK, with Turkish warplanes strafing targets in northern Iraq, where the group is based, came as Turkey, in a major shift, decided to join the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State, the Sunni militant group that controls a large section of territory in Iraq and Syria. Turkey has struck Islamic State group targets in Syria, and granted the use of air bases to U.S. warplanes, restoring its international standing as a reliable ally in the fight against the Islamic State. Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Jeff Davis said a drone had launched an airstrike from Turkey for the first time Wednesday, but provided no details. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, reaffirmed the governments commitment to the coalition, saying Turkey was ready for a comprehensive fight against the Islamic State group. Also Wednesday, Syrias Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem said Syria would support efforts against the Islamic State group, as long as the fight is coordinated with the Syrian government. Erdogan has said he is acting in Turkeys national-security interests in targeting terrorists of all stripes, both the Islamic State group and the PKK, as well as a homegrown leftist group that has periodically carried out attacks. But the bulk of the military operations have been directed at the PKK, which has carried out numerous attacks in Turkey during the past few weeks that have killed nearly three dozen people, mostly soldiers and police officers. The latest came Tuesday, when a roadside bomb killed three soldiers in the southeastern province of Sirnak, an attack that was followed by more Turkish airstrikes on PKK targets, according to Turkish news reports. Turkey also has arrested many suspected militants and has seemed to go to extra lengths to publicize the arrests of suspected Islamic State group members, perhaps to counter longstanding criticism from the West that it has been ambivalent about the threat posed by the group. However, according to news reports, many of the Islamic State group suspects have been quietly released for lack of evidence. The countrys new war footing already seems to be influencing some voters. I dont support Erdogan or the prime minister, but Turkey cant afford to have a weak coalition government, said Oktay Cenk, a taxi driver in Istanbul. The government tolerated the PKK for long enough. Its not possible to negotiate with terrorists, so we need to show strength against them and we need a strong government to do that.]", "Date": "20150805", "Title": "[Some see Erdogans domestic troubles fueling Turkeys war on extremism]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/some-see-erdogans-domestic-troubles-fueling-turkeys-war-on-extremism/", "Author": "[TIM ARANGO, CEYLAN YEGINSU]"}
{"Content": "[ Its suddenly become crystal clear that Jeb Bush has his eye on the presidency. With just a few words, the former Florida governor stepped further into the 2016 Republican presidential contest than potential rivals, declaring via Facebook on Tuesday that he will actively explore the possibility of running. Some of those rivals, as well as veterans of presidential politics generally, saw his statement as a de facto announcement that ends months of speculation about his intentions. The son and brother of presidents, Bush is the early favorite of the Republican establishment wing, and his move puts immediate pressure on other establishment-minded GOP contenders to start competing with him for donors, campaign staff and national attention in a crowded field of potential contenders. I didnt expect to see this happen this quickly, said Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa, where the first votes will be cast in January 2016 caucuses. For months, while other GOP prospects were in motion around the country, Bush largely avoided prominent political gatherings, instead pitching his education ideas to policy audiences and showing a little self-restraint about his ambitions. That began to change recently, and is destined to change more now. His announcement increases the chance of a dynastic presidential contest pitting him against Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton, though a long and unpredictable Republican contest looms. The former first lady will be her partys overwhelming front-runner should she decide to run. Assessing the Bush family legacy, another likely candidate, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, said, The question is whether people will tire of having one family in charge of things. On a day when Bush riveted the attention of the political class, two more Republicans said they might run too. They are Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a conservative with a maverick streak, and former New York Gov. George Pataki, a moderate. Both would be longshots. Conservative Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla. for one, questioned Bushs chances because of the lingering unpopularity of his brother, former President George W. Bush. I just dont see it, Coburn, who is leaving Congress, told reporters. Theres still hard feelings about George W. So you start out with a negative, because youve got the wrong last name. If he didnt have that last name, hed be a pretty good candidate. Bush has long been a favorite of establishment Republicans who care less about conservative ideology than reclaiming the White House. In a race likely to include fiery conservatives such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and former neurosurgeon Ben Carson, Bush will occupy the middle ground despite his overwhelmingly conservative record as Floridas chief executive from 1999 to 2007. He also gives his party a powerful tool for courting the nations surging Hispanic population. Bush is married to a Mexican-American, speaks Spanish and has been among the GOPs most outspoken advocates for an immigration overhaul, including a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who are living in the country illegally. I think that Jeb has strong potential appeal to that sweet spot in the New Hampshire primary electorate, said former New Hampshire Republican Party Chairman Fergus Cullen. Let Rick Perry and Ted Cruz and six other candidates fight among themselves for the far right  it leaves a huge opening for someone to go right up the middle of the Republican Party. His road to the nomination may not be easy, however. Within hours of Bushs announcement, the head of the Conservative Action Fund launched a petition against him. Together, we can stop a Jeb Bush run and give America a real chance to elect a true conservative president, wrote Shaun McCutcheon. He said his organization would do everything possible to get the right candidate for the White House in 2016  and Jeb Bush isnt it. Julie Summa, an Iowa social conservative Republican, said Bush must explain in detail his positions on immigration and education to be a contender. We Iowans are an open minded, well-informed, forgiving bunch, Summa said. So If Jeb Bush can make a compelling case for why he believes the way he does, he could be a contender.

{"Content": "[ ITS time for presidential candidates to pivot to Asia. So far the endless quagmire in the Middle East has dominated candidates discussion and debate of foreign affairs. Thats important and America has an obligation to show leadership in the troubled region. Its also instructive to learn which candidates are likely to repeat our terrible mistakes and ignore lessons we should have learned about the futility of military solutions to problems in a place defined by ancient religious rivalries. But voters need to know where candidates stand on other overseas challenges the country will face in 2016 and beyond. China now tops that list. Maintaining positive relations with this restless frenemy will have a much greater bearing on Americas economic security and long-term prosperity. The ascendant superpower is undergoing a transition. Its enjoying new levels of wealth and global influence. Yet its leaders are struggling to maintain the countrys remarkable economic growth  growth that has also maintained internal stability. With Chinas rise has come disconcerting nationalism. China is aggressively challenging borders in the Pacific, rattling U.S. allies in the region and testing boundaries drawn after World World II. The U.S. response  including concerns expressed in May by U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter  has been outwardly dismissed by Chinese authorities and has stoked anti-Western sentiment in the country. Chinas move this month to devalue its currency is also troubling. Rising wages were opening the door for the United States and other countries to expand manufacturing and compete. But that door will be slammed shut if China further manipulates its currency to maintain its cost advantage. That follows Chinas moves to dissuade use of American technology products and turn to domestic suppliers, purportedly because of security concerns. These moves affect the scarcity of jobs in America and the middle class sense of falling behind, which remain top concerns of voters. Yet instead of discussing how to win manufacturing back from China, increase trade and create jobs, politicians rail on about the boogeyman of illegal immigration  the rate of which has leveled off. Candidates should also stop threatening to start another terrible, misguided war in the Persian Gulf. Instead, tell voters how America can respond to Chinas apparent intrusion into government computers and personnel files. Not to mention new revelations that Chinese security services are secretly operating on U.S. soil and harassing expatriates. Perhaps candidates would focus more on Asia-Pacific issues if Washington, Oregon and California would get their act together with presidential primaries. All three states hold their primaries late, long after the March runoffs elsewhere in the country. The timing diminishes the influence these trade-oriented states have on campaigns. Even so, the growing importance of China to the entire country demands that presidential candidates discuss the Middle Kingdom as well as the Middle East.]", "Date": "20150817", "Title": "[Why presidential candidates need to pay attention to China]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/editorials/its-time-for-presidential-candidates-to-pay-attention-to-asia/", "Author": "[Seattle Times editorial board]"}
{"Content": "[ Ive admired the Clintons foundation for years for its fine work on AIDS and global poverty, and Ive moderated many panels at the annual Clinton Global Initiative. Yet with each revelation of failed disclosures or the appearance of a conflict of interest from speaking fees of $500,000 for the former president, I have wondered: What were they thinking?, But the problem is not precisely the Clintons. Its our entire disgraceful money-based political system. Look around:,  Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey accepted flights and playoff tickets from Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who has business interests Christie can affect.  U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida has received financial assistance from a billionaire, Norman Braman, and has channeled public money to Bramans causes.  Jeb Bush likely has delayed his formal candidacy because then he would have to stop coordinating with his super PAC and raising money for it. He is breaching at least the spirit of the law. When problems are this widespread, the problem is not crooked individuals but perverse incentives from a rotten structure. There is a systemic corruption here, says Sheila Krumholz of the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign money. Its kind of baked in. Most politicians are good people. Then they discover that money is the only fuel that makes the system work and sometimes step into the bog themselves. Money isnt a new problem, of course. John F. Kennedy was accused of using his fathers wealth to buy elections. In response, he joked that he had received the following telegram from his dad: Dont buy another vote. I wont pay for a landslide!, Yet Robert Reich, Bill Clintons labor secretary and now chairman of the national governing board of Common Cause, a nonpartisan watchdog group, notes that inequality has hugely exacerbated the problem. Billionaires adopt presidential candidates as if they were prize racehorses. Yet for them, its only a hobby expense. For example, Sheldon and Miriam Adelson donated $92 million to super PACs in the 2012 election cycle; as a share of their net worth, that was equivalent to $300 from the median American family. So a multibillionaire can influence a national election for the same sacrifice an average family bears in, say, a weekend driving getaway. Money doesnt always succeed, of course, and billionaires often end up wasting money on campaigns. According to the San Jose Mercury News, Meg Whitman spent $43 per vote in her failed campaign for governor of California in 2010, mostly from her own pocket. But Michael Bloomberg won his 2009 re-election campaign for mayor of New York City after, according to the New York Daily News, spending $185 of his own money per vote. The real bargain is lobbying  and thats why corporations spend 13 times as much lobbying as they do contributing to campaigns, by the calculations of Lee Drutman, author of a recent book on lobbying. The health care industry hires about five times as many lobbyists as there are members of Congress. Thats a shrewd investment. Drug company lobbyists have prevented Medicare from getting bulk discounts, amounting to perhaps $50 billion a year in extra profits for the sector. Likewise, lobbying has carved out the egregious carried interest tax loophole, allowing many financiers to pay vastly reduced tax rates. In that respect, money in politics both reflects inequality and amplifies it. Lobbyists exert influence because they bring a potent combination of expertise and money to the game. They gain access, offer a well-informed take on obscure issues  and, for a member of Congress, you think twice before biting the hand that feeds you. The Supreme Court is partly to blame for the present money game, for its misguided rulings that struck down limits in campaign spending by corporations and unions and the overall political donation cap for individuals. Still, President Barack Obama could take one step that would help: an executive order requiring federal contractors to disclose all political contributions. President Obama could bring the dark money into the sunlight in time for the 2016 election, notes Michael Waldman of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. Its the single most tangible thing anyone could do to expose the dark money that is now polluting politics. Ive covered corrupt regimes all over the world, and I find it ineffably sad to come home and behold institutionalized sleaze in the United States. Reich told me that for meaningful change to arrive, voters need to reach a point of revulsion.

Hes specifically concerned about the King County Children and Family Justice Center, set to begin construction in spring 2016 and open in fall 2019. This jail  theyre building it for those babies to fill, said Williams, who works with a group called Ending the Prison Industrial Complex (EPIC). Its why Williams and representatives from Seattle King County NAACP, EPIC and Youth Undoing Institutional Racism (YUIR) say a Seattle Office for Civil Rights racial equity examination of the proposed jail failed to dig into its impacts  both racial and economic. The report was released in June. About 30 young people, many of them people of color, stood behind a group of speakers at a Wednesday news conference outside the Bethany United Church of Christ in Beacon Hill, mentioning alternatives they would prefer to incarceration, including dance, basketball and tutoring programs. In March, the county announced it would reduce the number of jail beds in the center to 112 in an effort to address the disproportionality of jailed black youth. We live in the only county in America thats actually named after Dr. King himself, but this is exactly the process were going through by spending a quarter of a billion dollars to lock our youths up, said Gerald Hankerson, Seattle King County NAACP president. Opposition to the proposed juvenile court and detention facility has bubbled since 2012, when King County voters supported a nine-year levy increase to provide $210 million for the project. More than 60 organizations oppose the youth jail, according to a statement by the organizers of Wednesdays news conference. NAACP notes that African Americans account for nearly 1 million of the 2.3 million people incarcerated nationwide. Blacks are 8 percent of King Countys youth but total half the juveniles in detention, King County Executive Dow Constantine said in his April 2015 State of the County address. In 2015, we cant deny that your ZIP code and the shade of your melanin will be the determinant of where you end up as an adult in your life, said Sheley Secrest, Seattle King County NAACP economic chair. The reports recommendations include providing quality medical, mental- and behavioral-health services, designing detention spaces that can be converted to non-detention spaces in the future, and holding youth who could be processed in the adult system in a youth facility, not an adult jail. An overarching goal is eliminating the need to detain or incarcerate youth at all. It didnt satisfy the opposition groups, who say the county missed an opportunity to look at the jails overall impacts. The report reinforced many of the points raised by jail opponents, Williams said, but didnt propose any alternatives to the detention center. Everyones talking about zero detention, Williams said.

{"Content": "[ KENNER, La. (AP)  Pitching himself as a doer in a field of talkers, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal declared his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination Wednesday and set about trying to distinguish himself from better known rivals. Its a long-shot effort for an accomplished but overshadowed governor, and his prospects will depend in large measure on his continued courtship of evangelical voters. But several other contenders also are determined to win over that group. We have a bunch of great talkers running for president, Jindal said at his opening rally. Weve had enough of talkers. Its time for a doer. Im not running for president to be somebody. Im running for president to do something. An Oxford-educated son of Indian immigrants, Jindal can point to a political career filled with many achievements in a short time: a position as state health secretary when he was merely age 24, election to Congress at 32 and election as governor four years later. But the GOP lineup does not lack seasoned politicians, some with much more star power. Jindal quickly struck at one of them, accusing former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush of wanting Republicans to hide our conservative ideals. But the truth is if we go down that road again, we will lose again, Jindal said. Jindal announced his campaign online earlier Wednesday. Video clips on his website showed Jindal and his wife, Supriya, talking to their three children about the campaign to come. Aides discussed Jindals plans to focus on social conservatives, as he has done for months in extensive travels, and highlight his reputation as a leader steeped in policy. Jindal intends to present himself as the youngest candidate with the longest resume, citing an extensive background in public policy and government, strategist Curt Anderson said. In his speech, the Louisiana governor sought to position himself as an outsider: I am running for president without permission from headquarters in Washington, D.C. Unpopular at home, Jindal waited until the state legislative session had ended and lawmakers found a way to close a $1.6 billion budget gap before he scheduled his presidential announcement. But he has been building his campaign for months with trips to key presidential voting states, particularly Iowa, where he has focused on Christian conservatives. Raised a Hindu but a convert to Catholicism as a teenager, Jindal is competing for the evangelical vote with several contenders, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. While Jindal will continue to focus on religious liberty, Anderson said, he aims to prove a candidate can be both smart and Christian. And in recent weeks, Jindal has worked to showcase more of the policy wonk reputation that got him elected governor, rather than just focusing on cultural issues. He has drawn distinctions from other GOP contenders by noting he has published detailed plans on health care, defense, education and energy policy. He has suggested governors are better equipped to become president because they have run state governments, balanced budgets and implemented policy. Thats an argument, however, that other White House hopefuls are making or can: Govs. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. And Jindal doesnt get glowing reviews of his governance at home, as both Republicans and Democrats blame the governors financial policies for causing repeated budget crises and suggest those policies are driven by political ambitions. As the governor spoke inside, anti-Jindal protesters amassed outside. Christopher Williams, a University of New Orleans student who called for the protest on a Facebook page, said participants had a variety of beefs with Jindal, such as his tax policy, education cuts and opposition to gay marriage. One thing that the governor has been able to do is unite people against him, Williams said. A path to a GOP primary victory remains difficult for Jindal. Republican candidate debates begin in August and its unclear if he will make the cut if based on standing in national polls. Campaign manager Timmy Teepell, a former chief of staff who ran Jindals two races for governor, said Jindal will focus on the states that vote early in the presidential race, not a national campaign. Jindal has trips planned to New Hampshire and Iowa later this week. ", "Date": "20150624", "Title": "[Now Louisiana Gov.

{"Content": "[ Know him or not, in 2014, Seattle venture capitalist Nick Hanauers politics are sure to be in your face  and headed for your ballot. As a renegade member of the 1 percent, Hanauer is trying to tilt the debate over what makes the economy tick, arguing against the conservative dogma that the wealthy are job creators. Or, as he likes to put it, Prosperity isnt something that squirts out of rich people. Its a result of policies that boost the wages of average workers, he says. Hanauer has become a leading advocate for spiking the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. While thats unlikely to happen on a national level, Hanauer is part of a panel appointed by Seattle Mayor Ed Murray working up a $15-minimum-wage plan for the city. Its a crusade that drives some of his capitalist pals bonkers. Even the CEO of Hanauers family-owned pillow-making business argues a $15-an-hour minimum wage would destroy the company. As if that werent enough controversy, Hanauer also has jumped into the fight over gun control. Enraged by the massacre of schoolchildren at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut in 2012, he helped bankroll a proposal to require background checks for all gun purchases in Washington. That measure is headed for the November ballot as Initiative 594. Hanauer, 54, has long been a behind-the-scenes player in Democratic political circles. He cofounded the League of Education Voters in 2001. He and his wife, Leslie, have given nearly $5million to state and federal political candidates and initiative campaigns since 2000, including $250,000 to a failed 2010 state income-tax initiative and $1million to 2012s successful charter-schools initiative. Thats in addition to checks doled out by the Nick and Leslie Hanauer Foundation, which donates hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to progressive think tanks and activist nonprofits. Hanauers public profile has grown in recent years. He is the co-author of two books and a frequent guest on cable-TV talk shows, and appeared in the documentary Inequality For All. While hes not the first local political donor to throw his weight around, in 2014 its hard to identify anyone whos more in the middle of the fray. Right now we are in the era of Nick Hanauer, said Chris Vance, former chairman of the state Republican Party. Success story and beyond, Hanauer made his name in the family pillow business before striking it rich as an early investor in Amazon. Now more interested in public policy than making money, he spends much of his time researching, writing and talking about income inequality. And his ideas have penetrated deep into Democratic politics. Look no further than President Obama, who has been talking since his 2012 re-election campaign about middle-out economic policies, based on the idea that prosperity flows from the middle class, not the wealthy. The term middle-out was coined by Hanauer and Eric Liu, a former speechwriter for President Clinton. Their two pamphlet-length books, The True Patriot and The Gardens of Democracy, aim to be a kind of manifesto for progressives about citizenship and the role of government. As a successful entrepreneur  not a billionaire, but well on his way  Hanauer makes a provocative messenger for the argument that the country would be better off taxing the rich to fund programs that favor the middle class and poor., Nicks influence comes from three tangible things: Hes a donor, hes also an activist, and hes cast against type, said David Rolf, president of union local SEIU Healthcare 775NW, a friend and close political ally of Hanauer in the $15-minimum-wage movement. Energetic, blunt and sometimes profane, Hanauer seems to take particular delight in ripping business moguls who resent paying higher taxes. This is my world, I know a lot of these folks, Hanauer said in an appearance on MSNBC last week. These are borderline sociopathic people, and they dont care about other people and they have no empathy. Hanauers sway extends to members of Congress, the White House and even presidential wannabes. Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley  a Democrat said to be considering a presidential run in 2016  has been passing out copies of Hanauers books to friends. I think the very fact that the minimum-wage debate is spreading, and so much of the language echoes Nicks insights and language  I think thats evidence of his impact, OMalley said. Hanauer interrupted one recent phone call with a reporter. I have to go. Sen. Hagan is walking into my office, he said. That was U.S. Sen. Kay Hagan, a North Carolina Democrat facing a tough re-election challenge, who paid a visit to Hanauer while in Seattle. She later left him a flattering voice message saying shed started his book and wanted to give him full credit for the middle-out economic debate. They come in thinking theyre raising money for their campaigns, and they walk out realizing theyve become one of my middle-out minions, Hanauer said. Going big for $15 wage, Hanauer has been obsessed with the $15-an-hour minimum wage since late 2012, when he emailed a Columbia University economist, calling it a go-big-or-go-home idea that could have more impact than 20 years of union bargaining. Hanauer honed his argument in an attention-grabbing op-ed for Bloomberg News last June, headlined , claiming a big jump in the federal minimum wage would stimulate the economy. He used his familys longtime pillow-making business, Pacific Coast Feather, as an example. The company has struggled, like many others, with sagging consumer demand. An economy such as ours that increasingly concentrates wealth in the top 1 percent  isnt a place to build much of a pillow business, or any other business for that matter, he wrote. Critics argue Hanauers prescription would be a disaster. A Forbes magazine columnist labeled his minimum-wage proposal near insane. The idea even horrifies the CEO of Hanauers family pillow business. If someone were to force me to move the base wage in our manufacturing organizations to $15 an hour, we will be out of business in six months. Period, said Joe Crawford, CEO of Seattle-based Pacific Coast Feather. The company pays an average of about $11 an hour, not including benefits, at its pillow-making plants in North Carolina, Illinois, Iowa and California, Crawford said. (The $15 minimum wage in Seattle would not be a factor, he said, because employees at the company headquarters already are paid more.), Crawford stressed he agrees with Hanauer that too many Americans are working hard without getting ahead. But he said a big boost in the minimum wage would have unintended consequences. Thats because Pacific Coast Feather competes with foreign manufacturers whose labor costs already are cheaper. American consumers are very interesting folks. They like to talk about Made in the USA until they have to pay a nickel more, Crawford said. Hanauer is used to those arguments. Joe hates my politics, he said cheerfully. Eye on the big picture, Critics of raising the minimum wage  even his own CEO  fail to see the big picture, Hanauer says. If all workers receive higher wages, theyll have more money to spend  and theyd spend some of it on pillows. A federal $15-an-hour minimum wage would lead to $450billion in additional consumer spending a year, he estimates. When pressed, Hanauer acknowledges that quickly raising the minimum wage that high could be problematic for some companies. Thats why the task force hes part of is considering phasing in the wage in Seattle and adding exemptions for small businesses. But for Hanauer, the details of how and where to raise the wage are not as important as the fact that hes helping change the conversation. What I am far more interested in is framing up the right set of questions, getting people to think about prosperity in the right way, he said. Do we want to live in a society where people work full time and still have to get government assistance and go on food stamps? Do we want to live in a society that is economically optimized for places like McDonalds and Wal-Mart? Hanauer said. Forcing higher wages might harm such companies, he said. But I would respectfully suggest that if you have a business model that cant survive without paying people poverty wages, maybe you should go out of business. Besides, Hanauer noted that taxpayers wind up subsidizing low-wage workers who qualify for food stamps and other government aid., Liu, Hanauers book co-author, said Hanauers style is to provoke by getting people out of their self-justifying or clichd ways of thinking. He likes to jolt that way. But some political opponents find Hanauers certitude less endearing. I regard him as one of the many misguided rich donors who want to make the state in their own image, said Randy Pepple, a Republican political consultant critical of the network of liberal nonprofits funded by Hanauer and other donors. Alan Gottlieb, a prominent Bellevue Second Amendment activist, said he reached out to Hanauer through an intermediary to see if hed discuss ways to make his background-check initiative more palatable to gun-rights advocates. Hanauer wasnt interested. I thought his response was a little arrogant, Gottlieb said. I dont think he has any interest in meeting with people who dont share his views. Gottlieb is running a competing gun measure on the November ballot. Initiative 591 would prohibit Washington state from adopting any gun background-check standards stricter than federal law. Hanauer said by the time Gottlieb reached out, initiative backers were on a fast track to file the measure. He added that since Gottlieb has spent his career pushing pro-gun laws, he  was not someone we considered seriously as a source for advice. Middle-class Bellevue kid, Born in New York, Hanauer grew up in a middle-class neighborhood in Bellevue. He got a philosophy degree from the University of Washington and says hes had the same political leanings for as long as he can remember. I come from generations of progressive, atheist Jews, he said. After years helping to grow Pacific Coast Feather, Hanauer struck it rich investing in startups. An early Seattle friend of Jeff Bezos, he became the first nonfamily investor in Amazon.com in 1995, betting all the cash he had at the time  $45,000  on the nascent Internet bookseller. When he sold his Amazon stock in 2000, it was worth more than $100million., Hanauer has subsequently founded or financed a series of successful startups, including aQuantive, a digital-advertising company that was bought by Microsoft in 2007 for $6.4billion. He now invests in companies ranging from banks to Internet developers and a biotech firm testing a cure for cancer. Success has left Hanauer confident of his business and political acumen. Im not the worlds best philosopher. But I am one of the worlds best strategists. I will put my strategic abilities against anybody on Earth, he said. His vast wealth gives him what he describes as an indefensible, unbelievably lavish lifestyle complete with private jet and five houses. His 7,000-square-foot Shoreline mansion alone is valued at more than $3million., But while capitalism has been good to Hanauer, he parts ways with free-market purists who believe unfettered markets always produce the best outcomes for society. For example, while Hanauer says hes incredibly proud of what Amazon has accomplished, its not an unalloyed good. Amazon didnt create any jobs. Amazon probably destroyed a million jobs in our economy, he said, pointing to reduced employment at brick-and-mortar stores displaced by the Internet giant. We have to find a way as a capitalist democracy to account for that, Hanauer said., Robert Nelsen, another prominent Seattle venture capitalist, likes to needle Hanauer about his politics. Before I met him I thought he was out of his mind, Nelsen said. He still disagrees with Hanauer on the minimum wage, for example, arguing that government creates more problems than it solves by mucking with the market. But Nelsen said he respects Hanauers constant questioning of the system., Even though I disagree with Nick on lots of things, I would say that having change agents is a valuable thing.

But it was clear that hope has dwindled a year after the April 14-15 mass abduction. President-elect Muhammadu Buhari said he must be honest about the prospects of getting the missing girls back to their families. We do not know if the Chibok girls can be rescued. Their whereabouts remain unknown, Buhari said in a statement. As much as I wish to, I cannot promise that we can find them. The statement by Buhari, a former military ruler of Nigeria who was elected last month and takes over May 29, is a marked departure from President Goodluck Jonathan. After Jonathans administration initially denied there had even been a kidnapping, he made repeated hollow promises that the girls would be rescued. Campaigners have replaced the slogan of Bring Back Our Girls  Now and Alive! with a new one: Never to be forgotten. Still, some of the marchers Tuesday held the new leadership accountable. We are here to appeal to the government to do better. We want our girls now and alive, said Solamipe Onifade, 16. A vigil was held after sundown, with people holding candles and singing. The gunmen initially seized 276 girls, but several dozen managed to escape as the militants transported them to the Sambisa Forest, with some clinging to the branches of trees from a moving open-back truck. Those still missing may have been split up. Witnesses said some girls were taken across the border into Cameroon. Boko Harams leader, Abubakar Shekau, claimed they had converted to Islam and been married off to his fighters. A negotiator said that at least three died in the early days, from a snake bite, malaria and dysentery. Then, Jonathan refused to negotiate with Boko Haram, who were offering to exchange the girls for detained insurgents. The girls became the focus of a global campaign soon after their abduction. U.S. first lady Michelle Obama had said she was outraged and heartbroken about the kidnapping and also posted a picture of herself holding a sign reading #BringBackOurGirls on her official Twitter account in May 2014. At least 2,000 women and girls have been abducted by Boko Haram since 2014, forced to become sex slaves and fighters, Amnesty International said Tuesday. Unknown hundreds of boys and young men also have been kidnapped and forced to fight for Boko Haram. Those who refuse are killed. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the U.S. has helped Nigerian security forces counter the threat by Boko Haram and also helped look for the kidnapped girls. Unfortunately, this kind of kidnapping story is one that is becoming all too familiar in Nigeria, Earnest said. We continue to be very concerned about that and we continue to be supportive of the efforts of Nigerians to counter the depraved tactics that are employed by Boko Haram, he said. Earnest added that the U.S. is engaged in a substantial number of operations to try to address the many needs of the Nigerian people, particularly as they try to counter the threat thats posed by Boko Haram. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said a team from U.S. government agencies was in Abuja to help both in the search, providing training, equipment, to try and help them find not just the girls, but all of those kidnapped by Boko Haram. A hopeful message addressed to the captives from Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai promised scholarships for the girls and said they must never lose courage. The 17-year-old Pakistani activist who stood up to the Taliban chastised Jonathans administration and other countries. Nigerian leaders and the international community have not done enough to help you. They must do much more to help secure your release, she said. Malala said she and millions of people around the world stand in solidarity with the Chibok girls. We cannot imagine the full extent of the horrors you have endured. But please know this: we will never forget you. We will always stand with you. Today and every day, we call on the Nigerian authorities and the international community to do more to bring you home. In Chibok, dozens of family members and supporters marked the anniversary by gathering at the remains of the school, in front of a burned out and roofless classroom. Young girls held handwritten signs demanding Bring back our girls  Now and Alive. One mother, Mariam Abubakar, told the crowd she was in disbelief that the government had been unable to rescue the girls during a whole year. On Monday, a few dozen people marched in Abuja, their mouths shut by red tape. When your voice is taken from you, which is what the terrorists have done to our daughters, you cant speak, you dont exist. But our girls exist, said organizer Oby Ezekwesili, a former education minister. The Empire State Building in New York was lit up Tuesday night in the campaigns purple and red colors to symbolize its call for an end to violence against women and girls. When Boko Haram started using young women and girls as suicide bombers last year, many wondered whether some were the Chibok girls. More such speculation followed when the insurgents beheaded women they had forced into marriage as they fled a military offensive on the border town of Bama last month. Several of the girls parents have died  some killed in Boko Haram attacks, some of illnesses like high blood pressure that residents blame on the trauma related to their lost daughters. The Boko Haram attacks continue despite a multinational military offensive that has ousted the Islamic extremists from all major towns in northeastern Nigeria in recent weeks. Scores held captive by Boko Haram have been freed. But there has been no whisper of the girls.

{"Content": "[ LAHAINA, Hawaii  Trade negotiators from the United States and 11 other Pacific nations were headed toward failure Friday, with difficult talks on the largest regional trade agreement ever breaking down over protections for pharmaceutical companies and access to agriculture markets on both sides of the Pacific. Negotiators will return to their home countries to obtain high-level signoffs for a small number of final sticking points on the agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), with bilateral talks reconvening soon. But the breakdown is a setback for the Obama administration, which had promoted the Hawaii talks as the final round before an accord that would bind 40 percent of the worlds economy under a new set of rules for commerce. President Obamas trade push had been buoyed by Congresss narrow passage in June of fast-track trade negotiating powers, and U.S. negotiators had hoped other countries could come together once Congress had given up the right to amend any final agreement. In the end, a deal filled with 21st-century policies on Internet access, advanced pharmaceuticals and clean energy foundered on issues that have bedeviled international trade for decades: access to dairy markets in Canada, sugar markets in the United States and rice markets in Japan. Australia, Chile and New Zealand also continue to resist the U.S. push to protect the intellectual property of major pharmaceutical companies for up to 12 years, shielding them from generic competition as they recoup the cost of developing next-generation biologic medicines. The trade ministers who gathered at the luxury hotels of Maui this week for talks that went deep into the night did have some successes. They reached agreement on broad environmental protections for some of the most sensitive, diverse and threatened ecosystems on Earth, closing one of the most contentious chapters of the Pacific accord. They also reached agreement on how to label exports with distinct geographic indications, such as whether sparkling wine can be called Champagne. And they agreed on a code of conduct and rules against conflicts of interest for arbitrators who would serve on tribunals to hear complaints from companies about whether their investments were unfairly damaged by government actions. But the failure to complete the deal  eight years in the making  means the next round of negotiations will push the U.S. ratification fight into 2016, a presidential election year. Most Republican candidates are likely to back it, but a final agreement would force Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton to declare her position, which she has avoided. This week, she said: I did not work on TPP as secretary of state, although she gave a 2012 speech in Australia declaring the accord the gold standard in trade agreements. The push for the Pacific deal has split most Democrats from their president. Further delay raises the prospect that a deal sealed by Obama might have to be ratified by his successor, just as George H.W. Bushs North American Free Trade Agreement was secured by Bill Clinton. The failure of the Maui talks pointed to the extreme difficulty of reaching agreement with so many countries, each with its political dynamics. Vietnam, Malaysia and New Zealand were willing to make significant concessions to gain access to U.S. markets. But with Canadas prime minister, Stephen Harper, fighting for his political life before national elections in October, Canada would not budge on opening its poultry and dairy markets. Chile, with a new, left-of-center government and existing free-trade agreements with each of the countries in the Pacific deal, including the United States, saw no reason to compromise, especially on its demand for a short window of protection for U.S. pharmaceutical giants. Australias delegation insisted pharmaceutical-market protections beyond five years would never get through Parliament, and the U.S. team was demanding 12. The bright spot might have been the environmental negotiations. The completed environmental chapter would cover illegal wildlife trafficking, forestry management, overfishing and marine protection, and it could set a floor for future multilateral accords. Under the agreement, the 12 countries  from Peru and its rain forest to Vietnam and the diverse Mekong Delta  must commit to obeying existing wildlife-trafficking treaties and their own environmental laws. Environmentally destructive subsidies, such as cheap fuel to power illegal fishing vessels, would be banned. The impact of the Pacific accords environmental chapter could be broad. The 12 participating countries account for more than a quarter of the global seafood trade and about a quarter of the worlds timber and pulp production. Five of the countries rank among the worlds most biologically diverse countries.]", "Date": "20150731", "Title": "[Pacific trade-deal talks falter over disputes in 2 key areas]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/pacific-trade-deal-talks-falterover-disputes-in-2-key-areas/", "Author": "[Jonathan Weisman]"}
{"Content": "[ LAS VEGAS (AP)  The Iran nuclear deal was only a few hours old when Republican White House hopefuls began vowing to overturn it. The stance may help them score points among the conservatives who dominate the Republican presidential primary electorate, where hostility toward President Barack Obamas foreign policy is a prerequisite. But with few easy alternatives, Tuesdays unanimous opposition among the Republican Partys most ambitious could be far less effective among general election voters in the fall of 2016. The contrast was clear with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, who quickly embraced the deal publicly and privately in a series of meetings with Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill. In a statement issued Tuesday night, she said the briefings she had received and a review of the documents led her to support the agreement. , , It can help us prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, she said. With vigorous enforcement, unyielding verification and swift consequences for any violations, this agreement can make the United States, Israel and our Arab partners safer. At roughly the same time Clinton was on Capitol Hill, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker was predicting that the agreement will be remembered as one of Americas worst diplomatic failures. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who, like Walker, has vowed to rescind the agreement should he be elected president, charged that this deal undermines our national security. The partisan divide reflects voters ambivalence over how to counter Irans nuclear ambitions, experts said. The cognitive dissonance of the American public on this issue  longstanding distrust of Iran balanced by dislike of new Middle Eastern entanglements  means we are not likely to see a lot of candidates gaining traction on Iran, said Suzanne Maloney, a former State Department staffer and senior fellow at the Brookings Institute in Washington. The Republicans who seem to be eager to use this as a campaign issue are going to have difficulty persuading people there is an alternative that is more viable and has a credible outcome. No polls have been conducted since the deal was reached Tuesday, but a new AP-GfK poll suggests that Democrats may struggle to earn the publics trust on the issue. Before the agreement was announced, 6 in 10 Americans disapproved of Obamas handling of the U.S. relationship with Iran, while just over a third approved. At the same time a slim majority of Americans (51 percent) said the United States should have a diplomatic relationship with Iran, the AP-GfK poll found, slightly more than the 45 percent who said it should not. And an April AP-GFK poll found 54 percent approved of the framework of the then-unfinished Iran deal. Republicans are far more likely to oppose the bargain, which was evident as 2016 hopefuls lined up to blast it. A group supporting Rubio released a television ad touting his opposition in an effort to burnish his conservative credentials. Campaigning in Iowa, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush called Obamas actions naive and wrong. Weve created, legitimized, Iran being a nuclear threshold country, and that in and of itself creates huge instability in the region, Bush said. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has been skeptical of U.S. intervention in the Middle East, said the deal was unacceptable and that hed vote against it. Better to keep the interim agreement in place instead of accepting a bad deal, Paul wrote on Twitter. The political reasons for Republicans to condemn the bargain were evident in a Las Vegas Harley-Davidson dealership on Tuesday, where Walker made his first appearance after formally launching his White House bid the night before. Robert Fulton, a 68-year-old Vietnam veteran in a dark muscle shirt emblazoned with a skull, vented at the deal. They were talking about fixing a chicken coop and they gave them the whole damn farm, Fulton said, holding a can of energy drink. Iran, he added incredulously, is the largest exporter of terrorism in the world. Walker took the stage and noted that a childhood friend, Kevin Hermening, the youngest of the 52 Americans taken hostage in Iran in 1979, had been a guest at his announcement speech. We need a president who will terminate that bad deal with Iran on day one, Walker said. I will put in place crippling economic sanctions on Iran and I will convince our allies to do the same. Neither Walker nor any of his Republican rivals offered clear alternatives to the Iran deal. Yet by condemning the pact, Republicans continue to link Clinton, the former secretary of state, to Obama in an effort to motivate their base and capitalize on voter fatigue after eight years of Democratic occupancy of the White House. Should the Iran deal pass Congress and no surprises occur, said George Perkovich of the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, it may well become a political wash because the two sides can argue to a stalemate. The Republican is going to say, We cant trust the ayatollahs, Obamas a terrible negotiator, Perkovich predicted. The Democrat is going to say, Then your choice is another war in the Middle East, only with a country three times the size of Iraq., ", "Date": "20150715", "Title": "[GOP candidates slam Iran deal, but will it play in 2016?]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/gop-candidates-slam-iran-deal-but-will-it-play-in-2016/", "Author": "[NICHOLAS RICCARDI]"}
{"Content": "[ Like a lot of people who pay attention to such things, I had assumed that Democrats had a huge advantage going into next years presidential race. Democrats do really well among the growing demographic groups, like Hispanics, single people and the young. Republicans, meanwhile, are doing sensationally well with just about every shrinking group. If 67-year-old rural white men were the future of the electorate, the GOP would be rolling. But theres a growing body of evidence to suggest that, in fact, Democrats do not enter this election with an advantage. There are a series of trends that may cancel out the Democratic gains with immigrants, singles and the like. We first began to notice these counterforces in the high-immigrant red states that were supposed to start turning purple by now  places like Texas, Arizona and Georgia. New types of voters have, indeed, flooded into these places, but as Ronald Brownstein points out in The National Journal, since 1992, Democratic presidential nominees have averaged only 44.5 percent of the vote in Georgia, 43.7 percent of the vote in Arizona and a pathetic 40.4 percent of the vote in Texas. Instead of turning pink or purple, these states have become more thoroughly Republican  from school board elections on up. Nationally, three big things are happening to at least temporarily hold off the Democratic realignment. First, the aging of the electorate is partially canceling out the diversifying of the electorate. People tend to get more Republican as they get older, and they vote at higher rates. And older people are moving to crucial states. In Arizona, Barack Obama won 63 percent of the young adults, but only 29 percent of the oldsters. This aging effect could have a big impact in the swing states of the Midwest, like Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa, Michigan and Pennsylvania. These states have generally gone Democratic in presidential years, but its hard to miss the growing Republican strength at every other level. As Brownstein notes, Republicans have a 42-to-18 advantage in U.S. House seats in these states. They control the governorships in all but Pennsylvania. They control both statehouses in all these states save the Iowa Senate. Second, Democrats continue to lose support among the white working class. In 2008, Obama carried 40 percent of white voters with a high school degree. By 2012, that was down to 36 percent. As John B. Judis points out in a National Journal piece called The Emerging Republican Advantage, the tilt of the white working class to the GOP has been even more pronounced in other races. In 2006, Democrats got 44 percent of the white-working-class vote in U.S. House races. By 2014, they got only 34 percent. In 2009, Republicans had a 20-seat advantage in House districts that were majority white working class. Today, they have a 125-seat advantage. Most surprising, Democrats are now doing worse among college-educated voters. Obama won white college graduates in 2008, but he lost them to Mitt Romney in 2012. In Colorado, for example, Obama lost 8 points in his support from college-educated voters from 2008 to 2012. White college grads are drifting away from Democrats down-ballot, too. And, most significant, there are signs that Hispanic voters, at least in Sun Belt states, are getting more Republican as they move up the educational ladder. Surveys and interviews give us some sense of whats going on. Voters have a lot of economic anxieties. But they also have a template in their heads for what economic dynamism looks like. That template does not include a big role for government. Polls show that faith in government is near all-time lows. In a Gallup survey, voters listed dysfunctional government as the nations No. 1 problem. In fact, American voters traditional distrust has morphed and hardened. They used to think it was bloated and ineffective. Now they think it is bloated and ineffective and rigged to help those who need it least. When many of these voters think of economic dynamism, they think of places like Texas, the top job producer in the nation over the past decade, and, especially, places like Houston, a low-regulation, low-cost-of-living place. In places like Wisconsin, voters in the middle-class private sector support candidates who cut state pensions and pass right-to-work laws, so that economic governance can be more Texas-style. In short, economic philosophy is mitigating the effect of demographic change, at least for a little while longer. Political guru Charlie Cook asks: Will this be a Time for a Change election or will this be a Changing American Demographics election? I suspect it will be a Time for a Change election. The crucial swing voters will be white and Hispanic college graduates in suburban office parks. They are not into redistribution or that Sen. Ted Cruz opened his campaign at Liberty University.

{"Content": "[ Like he did 82 times before, Sheldon Whitehouse stood on the Senate floor and preached the dangers of climate change. In his last speech before Congress adjourned, the senator warned that 2014 is on track to be the hottest year on record. It was a familiar sight: Whitehouse has given a speech about climate change each of the last 83 weeks Congress has been in session. He never has to give the same speech twice, he says  there are plenty of new angles to take on such a big problem. The Rhode Island Democrats ever-changing, ever-present floor speeches  warnings over rising sea levels, warmer oceans, eroding coastlines and more  make him the Senates loudest, most persistent voice on the dangers of climate change. Whitehouse is still haunted by what he saw after Superstorm Sandy: oceanfront houses in Rhode Island teetering into the sea. He fears future storms will be more catastrophic as sea level rises. Were not a very big state so we dont have a lot of land to give away to the sea, he said. He noted that Rhode Island finds itself on the receiving end of the climate change problem because it doesnt have coal mines or oil drilling. Whitehouse, now in his second term, is a former federal prosecutor and Rhode Island attorney general. His wife, Sandra Thornton Whitehouse, is a marine scientist who helped him see the importance of the oceans in everyones lives, he said. On a personal level, I have a deep fear of being ashamed, he said. I dont want, 20 years from now, when this is way past our current discussion, to be ashamed that I didnt do my best when we still had a chance to fix this problem. Whitehouse co-chairs the Senate Oceans Caucus and a congressional climate change task force. The caucus is working to get bipartisan legislation passed on fishing issues, ocean data monitoring and marine debris. As the Senate switches to a Republican majority, however, Whitehouse faces significant hurdles in getting meaningful climate change legislation passed. The oil and gas industry spent $53 million on the 2014 elections and nearly $75 million in 2012, with close to 90 percent of the contributions going to Republicans, according to the political money-tracking website OpenSecrets.org. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said his top priority will be to rein in the Environmental Protection Agency, which is trying to reduce carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants. He has said their overreaching efforts are strangling the economy. New environmental regulations have hampered U.S. job growth and caused a depression in eastern Kentucky coalfields, according to McConnell. But Whitehouse is hopeful. In his speeches, he has candidly described how climate change will affect individual states  particularly ones with Republican leaders who he thinks might support new environmental policies. And Whitehouse thinks Republicans will have to take more responsibility for solving problems when theyre in charge, and it will become a colossal liability for them to continue denying climate change as the 2016 elections near, he said. Whitehouse thinks theres a chance his latest proposal, to impose a carbon fee on industries that emit carbon pollution into the atmosphere, can gain some traction. Prominent Republicans outside of government have endorsed a revenue-neutral fee on carbon, including Ronald Reagans secretary of state George Shultz, Reagans economic adviser Arthur Laffer and former Republican U.S. Rep. Bob Inglis. To make it palatable to conservatives, Laffer and Inglis say the fee should be offset by a cut to the income tax. What conservative wouldnt jump at the opportunity to reduce the tax on income and put a tax on anything else? said Inglis, a former South Carolina congressman. Shultz, now a distinguished fellow at Stanford University, said the party is more concerned about climate change than it appears. Todays highly partisan atmosphere, he said, causes people to get on opposite sides of everything. Theyre sensible people and given the chance, theyll do sensible things, Shultz said. Im sure of it. Whitehouse has formed an unlikely energy alliance with U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia. Manchin visited Rhode Island in October to see the effect of climate change firsthand and Whitehouse toured coal and energy resources in West Virginia. They plan to work on crafting legislation to invest in technology for cleaner fossil fuel energy. In the new Congress, Whitehouse said, hell keep making speeches about climate change until there is serious action to address it. Another environmental advocate, U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, said Whitehouses climate change speeches present a compelling, absolutely riveting case for action. I consider myself vocal, but nobody is more vocal than Sheldon Whitehouse, the Connecticut Democrat said.

{"Content": "[ Lingering resentment over big Boeing tax breaks led to a snub for Gov. Jay Inslee from a key Democratic Party ally this week, as union leaders canceled the governors scheduled speech at a major labor gathering. Inslee had been set to headline the Washington State Labor Councils annual convention Thursday in SeaTac. But the governors name vanished from the schedule late last week amid discord over his planned appearance. Jeffrey Johnson, president of the Labor Council, said he disinvited Inslee after discussions among Labor Council members. I have enormous respect for the governor and the things hes trying to do, Johnson said Monday. He praised Inslees work on transportation, climate change and support of public employees and the common good. But, Johnson said, tensions persist over Inslees role in securing Boeings record-setting $8.7 billion tax break and his pressure on the Machinists union to vote on a contract that ended workers defined-benefit pension plan.  Feelings are pretty raw with a lot of our members, a lot of our unions, Johnson said. The resentment goes beyond just Boeing-affiliated unions, he added. Adding to the pique is Inslees refusal to endorse a push by unions to tie continuation of the Boeing tax breaks to wage and jobs targets. David Postman, an Inslee spokesman, said in an email the governor has a lot of respect for the Labor Council and works with them on many issues. There is disagreement on this one. But there is also a mutual commitment to keep talking about it, and we welcome that conversation, Postman said. Larry Brown, legislative director for Aerospace Machinists 751, said hed been unaware that Inslee was invited to speak at the convention until the governor showed up on the schedule. There then was a discussion on how the speech would be greeted, he said. But Brown said his union didnt seek to have the speech canceled. Representatives of Boeings white-collar union, the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA), declined to comment, as did Boeing. While governors dont speak every year at the Labor Council convention, the cancellation of a sitting Democratic governors planned appearance is unusual. The snub comes despite Inslee coming through on some big labor priorities during the recently concluded legislative session, including funding for the first cost-of-living increases for state employees and teachers since 2008. Unions backed Inslee heavily during his run for governor in 2012 against Republican Rob McKenna. They donated more than $5.2 million that year to Inslees campaign, the state Democratic Party and a political-action committee backing Inslee, according to the state Public Disclosure Commission and the National Institute on Money in State Politics. But Inslee faced a crisis not long after taking office, with Boeing pitting the state against others in a competition to manufacture the new 777X. During a 2013 special session, lawmakers approved $8.7 billion in aerospace tax breaks over 16 years  the largest state tax break ever awarded. That helped secure the airplane work for Everett. Machinist union leaders backed the tax breaks and jobs theyd bring. But they soured on Inslee after he urged Machinists to vote in 2014 on a new contract that ended their traditional pensions.  And theyve been frustrated at Boeings continuing to move engineering and other jobs out of state, while some aerospace-industry jobs that remain here dont pay well. Some Democrats have sought to tie continuation of the aerospace tax breaks to guaranteed job and pay targets. But two bills to make those changes  opposed by the aerospace industry  failed to gain traction in the Legislature this year. Inslee has declined to endorse those efforts.  Were still not satisfied with his position, Johnson said. We would like him to be more clear about supporting accountability in these tax measures. Postman said Inslee shares frustrations of those upset that Boeing has transferred jobs out of state after the 777X tax-break package. But the governor doesnt want to jeopardize the growth were already seeing with the 777X program. Notwithstanding Inslees absence, the Labor Council convention, which runs Thursday to Saturday, will include talks by other prominent Democrats, including Attorney General Bob Ferguson and King County Executive Dow Constantine. Seattles socialist Seattle City Councilmember Kshama Sawant also is slated to speak. AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Tefere Gebre also is speaking at the convention, which is themed Fighting Inequality and will feature panel discussions on taxes, the environment and immigration reform. Johnson said the events this week dont mean Inslee wont be welcomed at future union conventions. For example, in May, the Labor Council will meet to talk about endorsements for the 2016 elections. He wont be speaking at this (convention), but were going to continue our discussion to put a little more accountability into these tax incentives, Johnson said.

{"Content": "[ LIVINGSTON, N.J. (AP)  A tough-talking New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie launched his 2016 campaign for president Tuesday with a promise to tell voters the truth even if it makes them cringe. The Republican governor, a one-time GOP favorite who faded and now tries to climb back, lashed out at bickering leaders from both political parties in a kickoff rally in the gymnasium of his old high school. And in his trademark blunt style, he told voters  and warned Republican rivals  that hes ready to be aggressive in the 2016 contest. Who is in, and about to get in, the GOP race for president, Youre going to get what I think whether you like it or not, or whether it makes you cringe every once in a while or not, Christie declared. He added: I am now ready to fight for the people of the United States of America. He went on to a town hall meeting in Sandown, New Hampshire, receiving enthusiastic applause from the standing-room crowd as he arrived with his family. I want to be the next president of the United States and I intend to win this election, he told the meeting, held in an actual town hall. Christie has already held nearly a dozen town halls in New Hampshire, a state key to his hopes, and plans more as he spends the next week in the state. Christie enters a Republican presidential field that already has more than a dozen GOP candidates. Not all draw as much attention as Christie, who will compete for the same slice of the electorate as pragmatic-minded White House hopefuls such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. But its an accomplished lineup of governors, senators and business people. Christies effort is largely driven by his outsized personality, and his resume, while notable, contains scattered land mines that have given many Republicans pause. Four years ago, some of Christies backers tried to persuade him to challenge President Barack Obama. In the years since, he won re-election with ease, but also struggled to revive New Jerseys moribund economy and fought with the states Democratic-controlled legislature over pensions and the state budget. While Christies turn as head of the Republican Governors Association was widely viewed as a success in the 2014 midterm elections, hes also faced the fallout from the actions of three former aides, charged with creating politically motivated traffic jams at a bridge to retaliate against a Democratic mayor who declined to endorse Christies re-election. Christie has not been tied directly to wrongdoing, denies he had anything to do with the bridge closing and has seen no evidence emerge to refute that. Still, the episode deepened the sense that he may surround himself with people who will do anything to win. He declared early in the scandal that I am not a bully to counter the public perception that he is just that. The governor faces a tough sell with many conservatives, but has seemingly found his stride at times in visits to early voting states with the lively town hall meetings hes known for at home. There will be plenty more of those now that hes an affirmed candidate. Emboldened by his political successes in heavily Democratic New Jersey, he seems himself as a leader who can work across Washingtons bitter partisan divide. We need this country to work together again, not against each other, he said with his wife, Mary Pat, and their four children standing behind him. He promised to lead a White House that would welcome the American people no matter what party, no matter what race or creed or color. Yet Christie also jabbed President Barack Obamas weak and feckless foreign policy and called Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton the presidents second mate. America is tired of hand-wringing and indecisiveness and weakness in the Oval Office, he said. We need to have strength and decision-making and authority back in the Oval Office. And that is why today I am proud to announce my candidacy for the Republican nomination for president of the United States of America. In 2012, Christie was seen as the charismatic, pragmatic governor who burst onto the scene in made-for-YouTube moments. He gained national attention with a landmark deal in which the states public sector unions agreed to higher health care costs and retirement ages in exchange for promised payments into the states chronically underfunded pension season. Christies fortunes have certainly changed. Now, Christie has been eclipsed by others in a pack of more than dozen rivals. And his poll numbers at home have sunk to record lows. New Jerseys economy is lagging and there have been nine credit downgrades on Christies watch.

{"Content": "[ LONDON (AP)  The race is on for the 2024 Olympics: A five-city contest pitting four European bids against a two-time host from the United States. The International Olympic Committee announced the official field of candidates Wednesday, and there were no surprises as the previously declared bidders were all on the list  Budapest, Hungary; Hamburg, Germany; Los Angeles; Paris; and Rome. We are welcoming five outstanding and highly qualified candidate cities, IOC President Thomas Bach said. The lineup features three capital cities (Budapest, Paris, and Rome), three previous Olympic hosts (Paris, Rome, and Los Angeles) and one first-time bidder (Hamburg). Los Angeles, which hosted the 1932 and 1984 Olympics, and Paris, which staged the games in 1900 and 1924, shape up as early front-runners as they seek to join London in becoming three-time hosts. The deadline for submission of entries expired at midnight on Tuesday in Switzerland. Two other potential candidates  Toronto, and Baku, Azerbaijan  decided not to bid. This is a competition about quality, not quantity, Bach said in a conference call. The IOC also released the host city contract and other documents setting out the two-year bid process, which has been changed to eliminate the cut-down phase, and ensure that all candidates go to the final vote in Lima, Peru, in September 2017. Bach said a candidate would be cut only if it violates bidding rules or if the IOC determines a city cannot meet minimum requirements for hosting the games. The IOC has been determined to present a healthy number of bids and world-class field for 2024 following the troubled race for the 2022 Winter Games, which was left with only two candidates after four pulled out for financial or political reasons. Beijing defeated Almaty, Kazakhstan, in the IOC vote on July 31. Bach said all five bid cities for 2024 fully embraced his Olympic Agenda 2020 reform program, which seeks to reduce bidding and hosting costs. Sustainability and legacy are the cornerstones of each candidature, he said. The IOC will contribute $1.7 billion in cash and services to the organizing committee of whichever city is chosen as host. Bach expressed confidence the city will produce a surplus on its operating budget, which does not cover long-term infrastructure costs. The cities must submit their first bid files by Feb. 17, 2016. An IOC evaluation commission will visit the cities between February and June 2017. A technical briefing for IOC members will be held in July 2017, two months before the vote. Bach said the evaluation process would change from an examination style to a dialogue style, helping ensure that bid promises are kept once the games are awarded so that the organization phase may be less turbulent and more reliable. Los Angeles stepped in as the U.S. candidate after Bostons bid collapsed in July amid a lack of public and political support. The Californian city is bidding to bring the Summer Games back to the U.S. for the first time since Atlanta held the 1996 Olympics. New York and Chicago failed in their bids for the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, respectively. Los Angeles, which faced no opposition for the 32 and 84 Olympics, has lost in seven other contested bid elections. Paris is hoping to host the Olympics exactly 100 years after it last held the games. The French capital was the favorite for the 2012 Games but lost out to London. Rome is seeking to take the games back to the Italian capital for the first time since 1960. Rome dropped out of the bidding for the 2020 Olympics when the government refused to give financial support. Hamburgs bid faces a referendum among voters in the northern port city on Nov. 29, with no certainty that it will win. What is important for the IOC is that we want to send the athletes only to cities where they are welcome, Bach said, adding that the IOC will carry out its own confidential polling in all the bid cities. Germany, which last held the Summer Olympics in Munich in 1972, is the leading contender to host the European soccer championship in 2024, but Bach  a German  said there was no reason the country couldnt hold both events. Nobody has a real doubt about the organizational skills of Germany, and German sport in particular, he said. Budapest, which has failed in numerous previous bids, would bring the Olympics to Hungary for the first time. Hungary is facing criticism for its tough stance on migrants and refugees, while Germany has been praised for its welcoming policy. This humanitarian challenge is going beyond Olympic candidatures, Bach said.]", "Date": "20150916", "Title": "[Race is on: 5 cities to compete for 2024 Summer Olympics]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/race-is-on-5-cities-to-compete-for-2024-summer-olympics/", "Author": "[STEPHEN WILSON]"}
{"Content": "[ LOS ANGELES (AP)  Amid all the bombast in the Republican race for president, Ben Carson comes across more like a whisper. He is, in some ways, the anti-Trump  a gentle candidate who lets his record as a renowned brain surgeon speak for itself. The bragging about his resume and place in the polls, on the rare occasions it comes, is delivered with none of the superlatives that Donald Trump cant seem to go without. Yet the 63-year-old Republican, the only African-American seeking the White House in 2016  has tapped into the same wave of anti-establishment outrage fueling the billionaire realty TV stars rise. The likelihood of someone like me getting through this process and making it to president is virtually impossible, Carson told The Associated Press in a recent interview. I just have to be myself. And if being myself resonates with the American people, then they will choose me. And if it doesnt, he said, they will choose somebody else. Like Trump, Carson was dismissed early as a gaffe-prone novice lacking a national profile and any significant political network. But he appears to be connecting with Republican voters at a rate that even his closest aides didnt predict. Heading into Wednesday nights second debate of the GOP contest, Carson finds himself alongside Trump atop the field. A New York Times/CBS News poll released Tuesday shows Carson favored by 23 percent of likely Republican primary voters compared to Trumps 27 percent. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, meanwhile, have plummeted to 6 percent and 2 percent respectively. It should be noted the poll found that 63 percent said they could change their minds before the primaries begin with the Iowa caucuses in February. Yet it was just one of several in recent days that feature the political rookies Trump and Carson leading a field of veterans of elected office, offering the clearest example yet that Republican voters have deep frustrations with the political establishment. It shows in Carsons fundraising, too. His campaign says it has raised $5 million so far this month, adding to the $9 million it pulled in during July and August  a strong performance at what is typically one of the hardest times for candidates to raise money. Wednesday night offers Carson a new chance to build on that momentum. A stage full of Republican candidates will face off at the Reagan Presidential Library for the partys second formal debate. Carson emerged from the first as a surprise success, his popularity fueled by his nice-guy image on a night when his competitors came out swinging. Yet he remains rough around the edges and has little experience with issues beyond health care and business, particularly foreign policy in an election where international affairs are a major part of the discussion. Hes memorized every nerve in the body, he can memorize the top 12 terrorists in the world, said Carson campaign manager Barry Bennett, dismissing any concerns. His team hopes to use any additional airtime hell get Wednesday night to highlight Carsons biography. He rose from the streets of inner-city Detroit to be head of pediatric neurosurgery at Baltimores Johns Hopkins Hospital. The story inspired a television movie and gives Carson unique standing in a Republican Party often criticized as the party of older, wealthy, white men. Carson briefly focused on race late last week by touring Ferguson, Missouri, the St. Louis suburb hit by rioting after a white police officer shot a black teen. After the tour, however, Carson condemned the Black Lives Matter movement and said the nation should de-emphasize race and instead emphasize respect. A religious conservative, Carson said hed prefer the movement change its name to All black lives matter  to include the unborn children of black women who have abortions. Better yet, he said, the group would change its name to simply, All lives matter. Hes expected to focus on party unity on the debate stage after declining to respond to his competitors jabs in recent days. Trump will be Trump, Ben will be Ben, and the contrast couldnt be clearer, Bennett said. In contrast to other campaigns, no one has been playing Trump during Carsons debate preparation sessions, which are somewhat unusual. Bennett described an all-day knowledge session Monday in which experts delivered presentations on various domestic and foreign policy topics. They dont pepper him with questions, he peppers them, the campaign manager said. And while Carson doesnt focus on race, his campaign suggests his status as the only African-American in the contest is a political asset. In a crowd of 17 candidates, it is important that you can differentiate yourself in as many ways as possible, Bennett said. Hes soft-spoken, hes African-American and hes a doctor. The campaign has begun running TV ads in Iowa and New Hampshire promoting Carsons biography. And its looking to expand a paid staff of 80 now divided between the campaigns suburban Washington headquarters and early voting states across the country. The political establishment remains skeptical of his chances, but Carson doesnt seem to mind. My whole life people have told me you cant do this, no ones ever done this before, this is impossible, he said. I dont even get charged up until I hear those words.

{"Content": "[ LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP)  Sen. Rand Paul launched his 2016 presidential campaign Tuesday with a combative challenge both to Washington and his fellow Republicans, cataloguing a lengthy list of what ails America and pledging to take our country back. Five things you may not know about Rand Paul, The New York TimesSen. Rand Paul announced his campaign for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination Tuesday. Here are some things to know about the Kentucky senator. A College SwimmerWhen he was an undergraduate at Baylor University, Paul swam competitively. To this day, he swims to stay fit using the Endless Pool he has in his basement at home in Bowling Green, Kentucky. But He Never GraduatedHe never earned his degree at Baylor because he was accepted early to Duke for medical school. He Performs OperationsAs an ophthalmologist, he still does eye surgery on patients from time to time  when his Senate schedule permits. He traveled to Guatemala last year, for instance, where he removed cataracts for needy patients. His Real NameRand is short for Randal. Often, because of his libertarian-steeped upbringing, people incorrectly assume that his parents named him after Ayn Rand, the libertarian heroine. People called him Randy when he was younger, but his wife decided that Rand sounded more adult. His Wife Is a WriterKelley Paul has a new book, True and Constant Friends, which she wrote based on her friendships with six women she met as freshmen at Rhodes College in Memphis. Pauls fiery message, delivered in his home state of Kentucky before he flew to four early-nominating states, was designed to broaden his appeal outside of the typical GOP coalition as well as motivate supporters of his fathers two unsuccessful bids for the Republican presidential nomination. In a 26-minute speech that eviscerated the Washington machine, he spared neither Republican nor Democrat as he attempted to tap into Americans deep frustrations with their government. I worry that the opportunity and hope are slipping away for our sons and daughters, the tea party favorite said. As I watch our once-great economy collapse under mounting spending and debt, I think, What kind of America will our grandchildren see?, He added: It seems to me that both parties and the entire political system are to blame. By criticizing fellow Republicans, Paul showed he was ready to run a tough-talking campaign equally at ease criticizing both major parties. Big government and debt doubled under a Republican administration, Paul said in a swipe at former President George W. Bush, whose brother, Jeb, is expected to be a Paul rival for the GOP nomination. He immediately followed up: And its now tripling under Barack Obamas watch. In what well might have been a jab at Jeb Bush and other rivals considered more mainstream, he added: If we nominate a candidate who is simply Democrat Lite, whats the point?, At a splashy kickoff rally, Paul promised a government restrained by the Constitution and beholden no more to special interests. I have a message, a message that is loud and clear and does not mince words: We have come to take our country back, he told cheering supporters. Paul is a fierce critic of Washington, where he is in his first term as a senator but often not in line with his partys leadership. A banner over the stage in Louisville proclaimed: Defeat the Washington machine. Unleash the American dream. Paul was clearly most passionate about upending the way Washington works. I propose we do something extraordinary, he said. Lets just spend what comes in. Cheers erupted when he decried government searches of phones and computer records as a threat to civil liberties. Most Republicans defend the practice as a necessary defense against terrorism. I say the phone records of law-abiding citizens are none of their damn business, Paul said of government officials. Tom Stewart, a 58-year-old resident of London, Kentucky, joined Pauls rally and counted himself a backer. I like that he wants less government, Stewart said. Less spending. Less intrusion. Maybe less intrusion into everybodys rights around the world. Pauls challenge now is to convince other Republican voters that his is a vision worthy of the GOP presidential nomination, a prize twice denied his father, former Rep. Ron Paul of Texas. The elder Paul joined his son at Tuesdays announcement and got a raucous cheer when he was introduced. Paul begins the 2016 race as the second fully declared candidate, behind Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. They could face as many as 20 rivals before the lead-off Iowa caucuses in February. Paul is a frequent contrarian against his partys orthodoxy, questioning the size of the U.S. military and proposing relaxation of some drug laws that imprison offenders at a high cost to taxpayers. He also challenges the GOPs support for surveillance programs, drone policies and sanctions on Iran and Cuba. But as the presidential campaign has come closer, Paul has shifted his approach somewhat on the question of how much government the country actually needs. He recently proposed a 16 percent increase in the Pentagons budget, a switch from his earlier call for military and troop cuts. Tech savvy and youth focused, Paul is expected to be an Internet pacesetter whom his competitors will have to chase. Pauls digital advisers, for example, kept track of who asked questions in a Facebook exchange after the speech, harvesting data to reach prospective voters. Its unclear how much support Paul can muster in the Republican mainstream. In one sign of his uphill climb, an outside group not connected to any candidate planned to spend more than $1 million on ads criticizing Pauls positions on Iran sanctions. Somebody is worried about me, Paul said in an interview with Fox News. On my day, when Im announcing, someone is spending a million dollars. And Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz continued the pile-on, telling reporters, Rand Pauls policies are way outside the mainstream. Paul is leaving open the door to a second term in the Senate. With the backing of his states senior senator, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, he is likely to seek the White House and the Senate seat at the same time. McConnell, who backs Pauls presidential bid, appeared Tuesday at a business event in Nicholasville, Kentucky. I think we take it one step at a time, McConnell said. Im confident if Rand is running for the Senate, hell be re-elected. One of Pauls likely rivals, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, is expected to announce next week that he will skip a Senate re-election bid in 2016 in favor of putting everything into a presidential campaign. Paul began a tour of early-voting states Tuesday night with a trip to Manchester, New Hampshire. Shaking hands and chatting briefly with supporters at Murphys Taproom, a popular spot for supporters of his father, the Kentucky Republican made no formal remarks. He was scheduled to speak at a rally in Milford on Wednesday afternoon.

{"Content": "[ MACKINAC ISLAND, Mich. (AP)  Former tech CEO Carly Fiorina, hailed for her performance at the second GOP debate, held roughly 1,000 Michigan Republicans in silence Saturday, broke them up in laughter and then brought them to their feet in cheers and chants of Carly, Carly. I am a fearless fighter. I will not falter. I have been tested and I will fight this fight, said Fiorina, one of five GOP presidential candidates to address the Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference. Most of the other Republicans seeking the partys presidential nomination were pitching their agendas to more than 1,000 party conservatives at an event sponsored by the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition. Businessman Donald Trump, the front-runner in polling, used part of his speech in Iowa to defend himself against critics who said he should have corrected a man at a rally on Friday when he asserted, incorrectly, that President Barack Obama was a Muslim and not an American. Trump said he would have faced criticism if he had jumped in and read aloud tweets he sent in his defense, including one that read: Am I morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him? I dont think so. Fiorina, whose physical appearance Trump criticized in an interview, continued her subtle jabs at the television personality and real estate mogul. Leadership isnt defined by position, or title, or how big your office is, your airplane, your helicopter, your ego, she told Michigan Republicans. In the historic Grand Hotel on Michigans Mackinac Island, Fiorina joined former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul for the three-day conference that has become a regular stop for GOP presidential candidates and attracted more than 2,300 overall. Michigan offers the most delegates of the three primary contests on March 8 and follows closely early nominating races in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. Republicans also view Michigan as more competitive for the general election than at any time since 1988, the last time a GOP presidential candidate carried the state. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker scratched the Michigan event  for the second time  because a charter flight he arranged was grounded in Chicago due to inclement weather, aides said. Walker had accepted an invitation to open the conference as the keynote speaker Friday night with Bush, but canceled due to travel constraints, then rescheduled for Saturday morning. We have moved heaven and earth to get him here, Michigan Republican Party Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel told those who attended Saturdays breakfast expecting to hear Walker. Walker attended the forum, put on by an evangelical conservative group, in Iowa, where he has seen his lead among likely Republican caucus goers disappear in the past two months. The scheduling wrinkle came as he scaled back his initially ambitious campaign for president to focus on neighboring Iowa, a scramble meant to reassure jittery donors and supporters after a quiet performance in the debate. Walker sought to distinguish himself as a proven government reformer by comparing himself to surging rivals such as Fiorina, who was CEO of Hewlett Packard, and Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon. You wouldnt hire me to be a neurosurgeon  you wouldnt want to hire me to run HP, Walker said. But if you want somebody whos taken on the Washington-based special interests and won  then I ask for your support, I ask for your vote. Ohios Kasich continued the appeal he made during the debate for the government to offer a hand up to people as a way to broaden the party. When we do better, people who live in the shadows cannot be ignored, he told Michigan Republicans. If youre in a minority community we want you to be lifted, we want you to be part of everything. Before dashing to attend the South Carolina-Georgia college football game in Athens, Georgia, Bush on Friday evening had a message similar to Kasichs. Bush has begun hitting back aggressively since Trump used a dire description of the state of the country and negative characterizations of Mexican immigrants to win support. Bush said Republicans need to show middle-class voters feeling left behind in by the economy and traditionally Democratic voting groups such as African-Americans that GOP policies benefit them. If we are serious about winning, we need to be on their side and assume that they want to achieve earned success, because they do, Bush said. Saturday evening, Kentuckys Paul described Republicans such as Jeb Bush as Democrat light and said I couldnt disagree more with modest reforms. I think we can be boldly for what were for and get new voters, Paul said. Cruz spoke to a lunchtime audience in Michigan before joining the Iowa group as its final speaker. In his evening remarks, he criticized Republican congressional leaders, saying they were not doing enough to defund Planned Parenthood and that they were trying to pound all of us into submission. He added: If conservatives unite, this primary is over. What Washington wants, what the Washington establishment wants, is to divide us. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and former New York Gov. George Pataki also spoke at the Iowa forum.

{"Content": "[ MADISON, Wis. (AP)  Gov. Scott Walker backed a surprise move Friday by Republican legislators to quickly vote on making Wisconsin a right-to-work state, an action the likely 2016 presidential candidate initially said should be delayed to avoid re-igniting massive pro-union protests. Walker had expressed concerns to leaders in the GOP-controlled Legislature that rushing the divisive proposal could distract from his agenda, and in September  during the heat of his re-election campaign  he said he wouldnt support it this session. But after a series of private meetings with lawmakers, followed by an announcement that the bill would be voted on next week, Walkers spokeswoman said he would sign it. Governor Walker continues to focus on budget priorities to grow our economy and to streamline state government, his spokeswoman Laurel Patrick said in an email. With that said, Governor Walker co-sponsored right-to-work legislation as a lawmaker and supports the policy. Walker walked past reporters, declining to answer questions, at a National Governors Association meeting Friday in Washington. Under right to work, unions are prohibited from reaching labor deals with businesses that require private-sector workers to pay fees to the union. Twenty-four other states already have the laws in place. Walker rose to prominence in 2011, when he pushed through a law known as Act 10 that effectively ended collective bargaining for most public workers. That led to protests involving as many as 100,000 people at the state Capitol and a 2012 recall election that Walker won. Unlike Act 10, which Walker proposed, the right-to-work push is coming from Republicans who control the Legislature. I think we can do this next week without it getting really ugly, said Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald on WTMJ radio in Milwaukee. Well see next week whether the Capitol blows up. I dont know. Unions were quick to criticize but were silent about whether they planned to organize massive rallies like those that went on for weeks in 2011. Right to work is a false promise for Wisconsin, said Phil Neuenfeldt, president of the Wisconsin AFL-CIO, in a prepared statement. Right to Work will not create jobs and will lower wages for all workers,, Dan Bukiewicz, president of the Milwaukee Building-Construction Trades Council, which represents union construction workers in the Milwaukee area, called right-to-work an unneeded distraction. I havent heard anybody come out from a business standpoint saying this is what they want, he said. The residual results of this will hurt the citizens of Wisconsin. There will inevitably be legal challenges to the law, but they are unlikely to succeed based on previous federal and state court rulings in Indiana and Michigan, said Paul Secunda, labor law professor and program coordinator for Marquette Law Schools Labor and Employment Law Program in Milwaukee. Proponents of right-to-work argue it will make Wisconsin more competitive and that workers should have the freedom to decide whether to pay and join a union, rather than having dues automatically withdrawn. Passing right-to-work is a priority for Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the statewide chamber of commerce that represents 3,800 large and small manufacturers and companies, local chambers of commerce and specialized trade associations. Opponents argue the law is an intrusion on the private operations of businesses and results in lower earnings, weaker benefits and higher health insurance premiums. Critics also say right-to-work would jeopardize a successful business model under which workers receive privately funded training to prepare them for work. The bill has no exemptions and Fitzgerald said at a Capitol news conference that it would not disrupt current contracts. Also, those agreements could be extended between now and when the bill is signed into law, he said. Under the bill introduced late Friday afternoon, violating the law would be a misdemeanor punishable by up to nine months in jail and a $10,000 fine. Union membership is declining in Wisconsin. Last year, 11.7 percent of workers belonged to unions, based on figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Thats down from 12.3 percent in 2013 and 14.2 percent in 2010, the year before the public union changes. Fitzgerald said there would be a public hearing on Tuesday followed by debate starting Wednesday. The Assembly wont take up the bill until the week of March 2, he said. Fitzgerald defended the fast track, saying the issue has been around long enough for people to know where they stand before the Senate votes next week. Fitzgerald said he wanted to move quickly because he had secured the 17 votes necessary to get it passed and he worried that if unions started television ads targeting senators, support may dwindle. I lay awake at night losing sleep over that all the time, he said. ", "Date": "20150220", "Title": "[Gov.

{"Content": "[ MADISON, Wis. (AP)  Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker is hoping to pull his campaign off the mat by taking on unions  a familiar foe for the Wisconsin governor  in a sweeping plan to upend pillars of organized labor nationwide. Walkers plan calls for eliminating unions for employees of the federal government, making all workplaces right-to-work unless individual states vote otherwise and scrapping the federal agency that oversees unfair labor practices. Union leaders are livid. Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union that represents 150,000 federal workers, said Walker is declaring a war on middle-class workers. And Democratic presidential contender Hillary Rodham Clinton accused him of bullying union members. One of Walkers Republican rivals challenged the plan, too, saying it is the wrong message for the GOP to send to unionized workers. Instead of treating all union members like they are the enemy, said former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, its time we invite them to give some of us in our party a try. In an interview with The Associated Press on Monday, Walker said no one should be surprised. I think people would be shocked if the governor who took on big government special interests wouldnt do it at the federal level, Walker said by telephone as he waited to board a plane to Nevada. In his speech spelling out his Power to the People proposal at a Las Vegas manufacturer, Walker said he didnt back down against union protesters in Wisconsin and he was ready for the national fight. Collective bargaining is not a right, it is an expensive entitlement, he said, speaking with his sleeves rolled up, in between a pair of oversized construction vehicles and in front of a large American flag. Bob Denoto, a 53-year-old electrician and union recruiter, was in Las Vegas from New York for a union conference and decided to stop by Walkers event. He didnt like what he heard. I know what the union has given me and my family, he said. Some day, when Im old and broken down, Im going to be able to retire without government assistance. Walkers move comes as he tries to gain traction heading into the second GOP presidential debate, being held Wednesday in California. A weak performance in the first debate and a series of missteps has contributed to his tumble from the polls after his strong start months ago. I think its a good move, said Richard Schwarm, a former GOP chairman in the early caucus state of Iowa who is uncommitted in the 2016 race. It gets a lot of attention on him in the next day or two. Walker won nationwide recognition for eviscerating public-sector unions in Wisconsin and becoming the first governor to prevail in a recall election, which followed huge protests against his anti-union steps. Now hes proposing to go national with an effort to curb union clout. Its reminding people of the reason they liked us in the first place, Walker said in the interview, brushing aside with laughter a question about whether the move was a sign of desperation. The reaction from labor groups and Democrats, their traditional political ally, was fierce. Scott Walker can now add one-trick pony to his resume, right underneath national disgrace, said AFL-CIO spokesman Eric Hauser. His campaign is floundering and so he does what he always does when he cant think of real solutions. He attacks workers. J. David Cox, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union of federal workers, representing about 750,000 people, said its a last-ditch effort by a failing candidate. It appears to me that Scott Walker is pretty much desperate in his campaign right now as hes sinking to the bottom of the polls, Cox said. This is desperate action on the part of a very desperate candidate. Clinton said on Twitter that unions make families strong. Scott Walkers attacks on unions and workers rights arent leadership  theyre bullying, she said. Her main Democratic rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, said Walkers plan would only make rich people and corporations even wealthier. If we are going to rebuild the crumbling middle class we need a stronger trade-union movement, not a weaker one, he said in a statement. Labor law experts were taken aback by the scope of Walkers proposal, which seeks to undo decades of law and would gut the landmark National Labor Relations Act  adopted in 1935 and signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the height of the Great Depression. Ive never seen anything like this, said Ann Hodges, a professor at the University of Richmond who has studied labor law for more than 40 years. This will take the breath away from anyone whos worked in labor relations for any length of time.  Its pretty draconian. Walkers plan also calls for prohibiting the automatic withdrawal of union dues to be used for political purposes and forbidding union organizers from accessing employees personal information, such as their phone numbers. While Walker could enact some of the proposals via presidential executive order, the most far-reaching ones would require an act of Congress, a major barrier by any measure.

{"Content": "[ MADISON, Wis. (AP)  Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a preachers son who withstood a recall election spawned by his fight with public employee unions, is joining the crowded Republican presidential race, aides said on Thursday. Having spent the past several months traveling the country, speaking to conservatives, courting voters and scoring well in some early polls, Walker will officially enter the race with a campaign announcement in the Milwaukee suburb of Waukesha on July 13, the aides said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they werent authorized to publicly discuss the campaign launch. Walker started a countdown of sorts to his kickoff by posting a slice of his presidential campaign logo on Instagram, with eight more pieces to come in the days ahead. He also tweeted an image of himself waving next to an American flag with the message It begins. In fact, the race has been underway for months. The jumbled Republican race already has already attracted 14 candidates, with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie getting in earlier in the week. Walker rose to national prominence soon after his election as governor by pushing for a law in 2011 that effectively ended collective bargaining for most public workers in the state. Four years later, he pressed to make Wisconsin a right-to-work state where employers and unions are barred from requiring all workers to pay union dues. In 2011, protests at the Statehouse grew as large as 100,000 people at times, and Democrats in the state Senate fled Wisconsin for three weeks hoping to undermine Walkers efforts. Walkers victories over organized labor certified him as a rising Republican star. It also made him a top target for Democrats and union leaders, who tried to recall Walker in a special election in 2012. Walker beat back the effort, winning by a larger margin than in 2010 and becoming the first governor in U.S. history to survive such an effort. Along the way, he shattered state campaign finance records, collecting six-figure checks from prominent conservatives across the country and building a network hes tapping now for his presidential bid. In between signing the union laws, Walker, aided by the states Republican-controlled Legislature, also worked down a list of conservative priorities. He cut income and corporate taxes by nearly $2 billion, lowered property taxes, legalized the carrying of concealed weapons, made abortions more difficult to obtain, required photo identification when voting and expanded the states private school voucher school program. But Walker has made missteps along the way. He promised in 2010 that if elected his policies would lead to the creation of 250,000 private-sector jobs. He fell far short of that, as only about 129,000 jobs were added during his first term, and manufacturing-heavy Wisconsin has lagged the national average in job growth since shortly after Walker took office. His proposed budget cuts to public schools and the University of Wisconsin, the deepest in state history, have generated bipartisan opposition. Walker has been dogged throughout his tenure as governor by two investigations, neither of which has led to any charges of wrongdoing against him. The first, begun in May 2010 while Walker was running for governor, focused on activity within Walkers county executive office. Six Walker aides and associates were convicted of charges including theft and misconduct in office. The second investigation, which grew out of the first, centered on whether conservative groups illegally coordinated fundraising and other political activity to benefit Walkers recall campaign and other Republicans who faced recalls in 2011 and 2012. This investigation is on hold while the state Supreme Court weighs lawsuits challenging its validity. Walker is trying to become the first president since Harry Truman, elected nearly 70 years ago, without a college degree. Walker attended Marquette University for three years, but dropped out 34 credits short of graduation in 1990 to take a job with the American Red Cross. Walker ran for the state Assembly that year and lost. He moved to a more conservative district outside of Milwaukee and ran again in 1993, winning that time. He hasnt lost since.

{"Content": "[ Magnolia activist Elizabeth Campbell is trying to resurrect a Ballard-to-West Seattle monorail plan. But just about any semblance of broad public support is gone. Citizen Petition No. 1 was organized by Campbell and a few advisers, working as the Century Transportation Authority (CenTran),   some nine years after the collapse of a stronger agency, the Seattle Monorail Project (SMP). The measure would impose a $5 license-tab fee on used vehicles inside Seattle, raising $2 million a year to plan a monorail. But its   questionable whether CenTran is capable of carrying out its mission. Some of the people listed as board members or technical advisers are uninvolved or, in at least two cases, opposed to the measure. Theres only one campaign donor beyond Campbell. Business leaders, school-board members and financiers declined her invitation to lend support, she said. Even second-tier types, who serve in neighborhood councils, have shied away, she said.  The measure is even opposed by some leaders in earlier monorail campaigns. The campaign budget of less than $5,000 means some voters may first learn of the measure when they open their ballots. This thing has come out of the woodwork, in comparison, to tell the truth, to how well organized the other one (SMP) was, observes Jud Marquardt, partner in LMN Architects and former member of Citizens Against the Monorail, which organized to fight the SMP. Campbell has previously run for mayor, led a petition drive that gathered 27,000 signatures against the Highway 99 tunnel, and served for years on Magnolia neighborhood groups. She said shes accustomed to holding strong opinions, and to being isolated.   , I am actually about doing something, and a lot of the people, theyre not brave enough to do something, to go for broke, said Campbell, whose careers before politics included owning a bakery and developing elder-care campuses. She believes theres an underlying population in Seattle thats dissatisfied with transportation in the city.   , If this passed, Id have people lining up to say, Im interested in this, she said. Makeshift campaign, CenTran proposes a 16-mile line along the Seattle waterfront from Ballard to West Seattle. A smaller circulator loop would carry people between Alaskan Way and downtown jobs. Its path to the ballot required only 1 percent of Seattle voters, or 4,582 valid signatures, under a leftover 2002 state law written to aid SMP. CenTran submitted twice that count to King County Elections and easily qualified. The sole funder for the signature drive was Lee Rabie, a retired businessman, who gave $21,342. (Rabie previously gave $61,815 to another Campbell campaign, Seattle Citizens Against the Tunnel.)    Two-thirds of that went to compensate Campbell and her signature collectors. For the fall campaign, CenTran reports $4,529 raised. All of that came from Campbell, except $1,000 from the Washington State Association of Electrical Workers. The $1,000 level is more of a support gesture, whereas $5,000 would indicate real support, said Lee Newgent, executive secretary for the Seattle Building & Construction Trades Council. Other developments illustrate the makeshift nature of the campaign:,  CenTran missed King County Elections deadline to file a for statement in the Nov. 4 voters guide, so that area is blank.  Campbell infuriated The Stranger by not attending the weekly papers   endorsement interview. William Popp, a longtime Bellevue traffic engineer, showed up to represent CenTran, but says he wasnt interviewed.  Campaign manager Libby Carr, whose op-ed covered the Westside Weeklys front page Sept. 26, is gone.  Asked to endorse the measure, West Seattle Transportation Coalition board members voted 10-1 to decline an endorsement. Nobody wanted to slam the door in their face, basically, because the consensus was, it wasnt going to pass, said co-founder Joe Szilagyi, explaining why they didnt endorse a harsher no position.  Two of six listed board members are out. One of them, Yusuf Cabdi, an advocate for African immigrants and a former Seattle Housing Authority board member, said he spoke with Campbell long ago, but is unfamiliar with the monorail. Anything that will take money from the taxpayers, Im not aligned with that, he said. Another,     Al Runte, historian and author of books about railroads and national parks, said hes too busy writing and speaking to serve with CenTran, but supports monorail as a better option than forcing passenger trains into tunnels, as designed by Sound Transit. CenTrans website also lists as special adviser Paul Toliver, former King County transportation director and SMP board member. But he has moved east to become deputy director of the Detroit Department of Transportation. Those remaining include Jake Solomon, a Bellevue sales representative, who agreed to join the CenTran board solely to promote small personal rapid-transit vehicles, as launched this year in Korea, as a loop between a waterfront route and downtown. He vouched for Campbells skills. I believe she has a lot of smarts. She knows the system, she knows the politics, he said. Aim: tackling gridlock, Popp, the Bellevue traffic engineer, says hes donating his work on alignment ideas  for instance, a monorail station where the Alaskan Way Viaduct now exits into downtown. He points to a gridlock disaster: Some drivers will avoid the tolled Highway 99 tunnel, and theres no sign city arterial streets will gain capacity. The buses arent going to work that well, even RapidRide, Popp said. You cant give every bus its own green light and have any kind of arterial traffic. It [monorail] can be built so fast, it has a significant leg up on the alternatives. On the other hand, CenTrans proposal to use the waterfront assumes the city and state would give up newly created right of way, after the tunnel replaces the Viaduct. That land has been designated for parks or bike lanes. Campbell argues that former monorail-engineering studies can be dusted off and put to work quickly. Thats debatable. Unlike this proposal, SMPs Green Line went through Seattle Center, down Second Avenue instead of the waterfront, and on the high West Seattle Bridge deck. Even where the routes match, new property would be needed, because old station sites were sold and redeveloped. As a transportation authority, CenTran could issue taxpayer-funded debt, with no sunset date. The petition calls for four staffers, board member pay of $1,000 a month, grants of up to $5,000 for citizens to do monorail research, and a governance structure that prescribes 34 ruling and advisory positions. A plan for the process to plan, says Dick Falkenbury, who helped lead Seattles grass-roots monorail campaigns in the 90s and 00s, but opposed the Campbell plan, in a Crosscut essay. Campbell replies it would allow new people to participate, by avoiding the usual government channels. The CenTran board itself would decide when to retire the $5 fee by giving up on the monorail, or by pushing ahead with a larger tax measure to build the system. The petition requires a monorail headquarters be outside downtown, with ample parking, something Campbell said brings a populist streak. Meanwhile, Sound Transit is building its downtown-to-Northgate tunnels, and   drawing concepts for Ballard and West Seattle light-rail lines, potentially to be featured in a 2016 Sound Transit 3 tax measure. These might cost $3 billion for Ballard and $4 billion for West Seattle  figures daunting enough to keep the pro-monorail argument alive.  Kim Pedersen, president of The Monorail Society, says the CenTran measure is biting off too much. He suggests expanding the Seattle Center Monorail to the sports stadiums, then proceeding one segment at a time. Cleve Stockmeyer, who was formerly an elected SMP board member, is listed as a CenTran adviser but says, Im not voting for it; you can vote for it if you want to. Campbell said she should have removed Stockmeyers name. And in some other cases, she listed as technical advisers people who have answered her questions in the past. Seattle doesnt need another transit-planning agency, Stockmeyer says. On the other hand, he says officialdom has yet to offer something better than SMPs unbuilt $2.1 billion, 14-mile Green Line. The real issue is, how many generations is it going to take for us to get multiple lines converging downtown? he said. So if monorail rumblings make politicians focus on moving high-capacity transit faster, fine with him. Mike Lindblom: 206-515-5631 or mlindblom@seattletimes.com.

{"Content": "[ MANCHESTER, N.H.  Hillary Rodham Clinton turned to New Hampshire Democratic officials and county leaders Saturday for help in fighting the surging campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who holds a steady lead over her in state polls in the 2016 presidential primary race. It was Sanders, speaking after Clinton at the state partys annual convention in Manchester, who received more ecstatic cheers from the crowd, as he denounced big banks, trade deals, tax breaks for the wealthy and super PACs like the one supporting Clintons candidacy. Well, it certainly sounds like some people are ready for a political revolution, Sanders said to shouts of We love you, Bernie!, While Clinton received an enthusiastic reception, with people beating inflatable noisemaker sticks that her well-financed campaign passed out, the ovation for Sanders was striking because he is not a party member (he is a democratic socialist) and has far fewer endorsements than Clinton from members of the state political apparatus. The convention drew about 1,000 delegates, many of them traditional politicians and elected officials not unlike Clinton, and 3,000 other participants, many of them longtime avowed liberals like Sanders. Sanders acknowledged he had come a long way since joining the race nearly four months ago, when he had a fraction of the support of Clinton in the polls. What looked like a fringe campaign is now seen as a campaign that is standing up for working Americans, that is prepared to take on the billionaire class, Sanders said. I dont want their money. I dont want a super PAC. Were going to do it on our own. Clinton, by contrast, highlighted recent endorsements from the states governor, Maggie Hassan, and Democratic senator, Jeanne Shaheen, and at various points mentioned her husband, former President Clinton, a popular figure with New Hampshire Democrats. Bill Clinton, in his 1992 campaign, famously vowed to be there for you till the last dog dies, and Hillary Clinton put her own spin on the sentiment. If you want a president who will listen to you, work her heart out to make your life better and together to build a stronger, fairer, better country, then youre looking at her, she said, drawing particular cheers from women as she emphasized the female pronoun. She pledged to fight for equal pay for women and address income inequality, and again invoked her husband as an example of economic stewardship. When he got into the White House, he realized he had inherited real economic problems from his Republican predecessors  that seems to happen, have you noticed? Clinton said. But she is not running on her husbands coattails, she said, as she repeated a popular applause line from her stump speech. Im not running for my husbands third term or President Obamas third term. Im running for my first term, she said, in remarks that ran for about 40 minutes  twice as long as those of other candidates. One of them, Lawrence Lessig, a professor at Harvard Law School, gently chided her, noting that he would respect time limits for speakers. While the crowd applauded the attacks on Republican economic policies, some Democrats in the audience also displayed unhappiness with their own leaders. Scores of them heckled the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, over the partys decision to limit the number of debates for its presidential candidates to six, a decision that one candidate, former Gov. Martin OMalley of Maryland, said was rigged to help Clinton. At points the hecklers nearly drowned out Wasserman Schultz with More debates! and We want debates, and the chants grew so loud that she went off script and addressed them. Whats more important, driving the contrast with Republicans or arguing about debates? Wasserman Schultz said. Lets focus on our task at hand. GOP front-runner Donald Trump proved an easy source of applause at the meeting. OMalley drew one of his biggest ovations when he described Trump as that racist, anti-immigrant carnival barker and blasted the Republican field for stoking the grievances of Americans. They can have their anger and their fear, but they cannot go unanswered, OMalley said. Anger and fear never built a great country. OMalley did not dwell on the issue of Democratic debates, but he made his case for more of them during a news conference afterward. He noted that the New Hampshire Democratic faceoff was scheduled for the Saturday before Christmas, one of the busiest shopping days of the year, when few voters might be inclined to watch the televised debate. I think everyone in the party realizes we should not let the Republican debates go unanswered, he said.]", "Date": "20150919", "Title": "[Clinton and Sanders each a draw at New Hampshire event]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/clinton-and-sanders-each-a-draw-at-new-hampshire-event/", "Author": "[Patrick Healy]"}
{"Content": "[ MANILA, Philippines (AP)  A popular Philippine senator and daughter of one of the countrys most famous movie couples announced Wednesday her candidacy in next years presidential election, promising to defend disputed territories in the South China Sea and speed up Internet connections. Grace Poe has topped recent popularity surveys and is likely to be among at least three main contenders to succeed President Benigno Aquino III, whose six-year term ends in June in one of Asias most rambunctious democracies. Former Interior Secretary Mar Roxas, who has been endorsed by Aquino, and current Vice President Jejomar Binay have made public their presidential ambitions. Binay, however, has not formally declared his candidacy. Aquino and Roxas had tried to convince Poe to run as Roxas vice presidential candidate. Roxas wished her good luck Wednesday following her announcement. Standing on a stage at the state-run University of the Philippines, Poe, 47, promised to continue Aquinos battle against corruption and address many concerns of ordinary Filipinos: poverty, crime, huge traffic jams, high power and income tax rates, the plight of overseas workers and even slow Internet speeds. We will hold accountable the crooked, whether friend or foe, Poe said. It is only right to continue the fight against corruption. She said she would open peace negotiations with all insurgent groups and pledged to strengthen the countrys ill-equipped coast guard and military to be able to defend territories in the South China Sea. The West Philippine Sea is ours, Poe said, using the name the government employs for the disputed region. We must protect it and not let it slip from our grasp by exhausting all peaceful and legal means. The U.S.-educated former preschool teacher, who lived and worked for years in America, has faced questions about her citizenship and whether she meets residency requirements for presidential candidates. She insists she is qualified to run and is ready to provide evidence. Poe entered politics in 2013 and won her Senate seat by a wide margin. She is running as an independent without the backing of a formidable political partys machinery. She, however, has something to compensate: a famous family name. She is the adopted daughter of Susan Roces and the late Fernando Poe Jr. who were immensely popular in the local movie industry in the past and remain widely known. Her father ran for president in 2004 but lost to Gloria Macapagal Arroyo amid allegations of widespread cheating, which Arroyo has denied. Poes life story  her mother says she was found abandoned in a Catholic church shortly after birth, her umbilical cord still attached, and was later adopted by the Poes  can be an advantage in a country where many voters are swayed more by personality than issues. The legacy of her father, who often portrayed champions of the poor and the oppressed, featured prominently in Poes speech. She also touched on her beginnings and twist of fate. Who wouldve thought that a foundling would ever lay foot in the Senate? Poe asked.

{"Content": "[ MASON CITY, Iowa (AP)  Hillary Rodham Clinton said Monday that if elected president, she would make opposition to a Supreme Court ruling that cleared the way for unlimited political donations a litmus test for nominees to the high court. I will do everything I can do to appoint Supreme Court justices who will protect the right to vote and not the right of billionaires to buy elections, Clinton told about 50 supporters at a house party in Iowa. While Clinton has previously said she would support a constitutional amendment overturning the 2010 decision known as Citizens United, she has not previously said publicly that she would use the ruling as a benchmark for nominating justices. She added Monday she is consulting with legal experts about other ways the courts ruling in the case could be trumped. Despite her staunch opposition to Citizens United, which helped usher into politics groups known as super PACs that can raise unlimited amounts of campaign cash, Clinton is directly courting donors for a super PAC backing her candidacy. Democrats were initially reluctant in the elections after the court ruled in Citizens United to fully embrace such outside groups, while Republicans did so with fewer reservations and are aggressively raising money for them in the early days of the 2016 campaign. Clintons stop in the northern Iowa town of Mason City marked her second trip to the state since she formally launched her campaign last month. She spent more than an hour talking with local officials, campaign organizers and volunteers  the type of small-scale campaigning some Iowa Democrats say she didnt do enough of during her first bid for the Democratic nomination in 2008. Clinton placed third in the Iowa caucus that year, behind President Barack Obama and former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards. The hosts of Mondays event, Dean Genth and Gary Swenson, campaigned actively for Obama in 2008. Genth said he didnt choose Obama over Clinton for any ideological reasons, but more because he captured everyones imaginations with his charismatic campaign and his ability to connect to the grassroots. While Clinton so far doesnt face as tough of a primary challenge as she did in 2008, her campaign is eager to show shes learned lessons from her past missteps. The campaign has hired 21 caucus organizers and six regional field directors who are seeking commitments from voters to caucus for Clinton early next year. The early organizing could also yield longer-term benefits for Clintons campaign, should she win her partys nomination. Iowa will be among the competitive battleground states in the general election and her campaign can draw on the voter contacts it makes now next year. Clinton arrived in Iowa under pressure from Republicans who want her to clarify her position on a massive Asia-Pacific trade deal being debated on Capitol Hill. While Clinton was supportive of the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact while serving as Obamas secretary of state, she has been largely silent on the matter since announcing her campaign. Obamas push for the trade deal has angered some liberal Democrats who fear the agreement with Japan and several other nations would hurt U.S. companies and workers. As she opened her remarks Monday, Clinton subtly defended her decision to avoid wading into the trade debate or taking questions from reporters on a range of other issues. Though she never mentioned the Republican criticism directly, she said small events that put her in direct contact with voters are providing her with the foundation for her campaign, as well as the kind of information I need to be an even better president.

{"Content": "[ Maybe, conservatives are done with dog-whistle politics. After all, National Rifle Association chief Wayne LaPierre traded his dog whistle for an air horn at a recent gathering of the gun faithful in Washington, D.C. I have to tell you, he said, eight years of one demographically symbolic president is enough. Subtle, it was not. Still, as insults go, it was a rather neatly crafted twofer. On the one hand, it demeaned the nations first African-American president and welcomed the day the White House is, well  de-Negro-fied. On the other hand, it also demeaned the candidate seeking to become the nations first female-American president and promised to save the White House from, well  woman-ification. Evidently, LaPierre wants America to get back to normal, normal being defined as when the president is white and male. So out come the air horns, blatting Woman! Woman! Woman! seeking to reduce a former senator and secretary of state to the sum of her chromosomes. Now the race is apparently on to see who will be first to tag the former law professor, senator and secretary of state with which crude, sexist epithet. Oh, the suspense. The blazing irony is that conservatives have at least two demographically symbolic candidates vying for their favor: Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American senator from Florida, and Ted Cruz (does no one else see Joe McCarthy staring back when they look at this guy?), a senator from Texas whose father was born in Cuba. So the normal LaPierre seeks is threatened, regardless. Not that he is the only one tripped up by Clintons woman-ness. Consider, a recent piece from Time magazine, which argued that Clinton is the perfect age to be president because, at 67, she is postmenopausal. Granted, the essay, by a doctor named Julie Holland, flatters Clinton and women of her age, assuring us that, having been freed from the cyclical forces that dominated the first half of her life, she emerges with the experience and self-assurance to be president. Still, could you not have happily gone the rest of your days without contemplating Hillary Clintons cyclical forces? More to the point, can you imagine such an essay being written about a male candidate? Marco Rubio is 43, which means hes probably already had his first digital prostate exam. Will anyone analyze how that factors into his readiness for the presidency? Rick Perry is 65. If he jumps in, will anyone speculate on how possible issues of erectile dysfunction might inform his foreign policy?, Heres the thing about demographically symbolic presidents and candidates: They tend to function like Rorschach inkblots. Meaning that what we see in them reveals more about us than them. Where Barack Obama is concerned, the right-wing panic over birth certificates and fist bumps and the left-wing tendency to idealize and canonize his every exhalation revealed the rank bigotry and messy irresolution beneath our post-racial happy talk. Where Clinton is concerned, these very early indications suggest her woman-ness will likewise be a minefield for friend, foe and media  even more, perhaps, than in 2008. And thats not to mention Cruz and Rubio. Who do you think will be the first to wear a sombrero to a Cruz rally in misguided solidarity or to tell the Miami-born Rubio to go back where he came from?, Point being that in America, markers of identity  gender, race, ethnicity  have a way of becoming identity itself, of blinding us to the singular, individual one in front of us. And campaigns tend to magnify that failing. To put that another way: Strap in. Its going to be a very long 19 months until the 2016 election. Even so, one thing is already clear, and it should please the rest of us, if not Wayne LaPierre.

{"Content": "[ MIAMI (AP)  Republican presidential hopeful Marco Rubios slow-go campaign strategy is puzzling party operatives in Iowa and New Hampshire, states where voters are used to candidates showering them with attention early and often. While some GOP hopefuls are already highlighting their progress toward visiting all of Iowas 99 counties, Rubios return to the state this week marks his first stop in the caucus battleground in a month. The Florida senator hasnt traveled to New Hampshire, home to the first-in-the-nation primary, since July 4, though he is expected to return before the end of August. Youve had some of the others who have worked it a lot harder, said Richard Schwarm, a former Iowa GOP chairman who is uncommitted in the 2016 race. I dont think its too late. But I think he should step up the appearances here because we are wide open. Fergus Cullen, a former New Hampshire GOP chairman who has yet to back a candidate, said that while Rubio benefits from goodwill and interest, his infrequent appearances in the state have cost him early endorsements. He would have more if he spent more time here, Cullen said. Rubio has visited New Hampshire just three times since announcing his campaign in early April. His stop in Iowa this week marks his fifth trip to the caucus state as a candidate. The senators advisers say they see little reason to worry about early state grumbling at this juncture in the campaign. Even after a burst of momentum following his campaign launch and a strong performance in the first GOP debate, Rubios team has said it doesnt expect the young senator to surge until fall or even winter, when voters start paying more attention to the White House race. On Tuesday, Rubio told reporters his Senate duties and fundraising absorb chunks of his time. But he also suggested it was too early for voters to worry, saying he would be in Iowa often, especially as we get closer to the caucuses. When this election becomes about what it should become about, and that is whats next for America  I feel very confident about our message, Rubio said after speaking to more than 100 people at the Iowa State Fairs political soapbox, a common stop for White House candidates in the early voting state. But even Rubios return to Iowa was literally dampened by off-and-on downpours, and the umbrella-covered crowd who attended his appearance at the fair was far smaller than those that gathered a day earlier for former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Early polling shows Rubio has lost ground this summer while billionaire businessman-turned-presidential candidate Donald Trump has surged, in part by tapping into the publics anger with Washington. Like some of his rivals, Rubio has spent much of the summer rounding up enough campaign cash to stay competitive in a lengthy primary. Rubios campaign and outside groups supporting him raised a combined $45 million through the second quarter, a strong number but well below the massive haul from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who brought in more than $100 million. We dont expect to have the most money, but we will be competing in all 50 states, said Alex Conant, the campaigns spokesman. Rubio, a first-term senator, has also eschewed the campaign trail at times for hearings and votes on Capitol Hill, where hes taken heat for being absent since launching his White House run in April. He returned to Washington the day after his campaign launch for a vote on giving Congress a say on President Barack Obamas Iran deal. He also skipped an in-person appearance at a New Hampshire candidate forum earlier this month to vote on legislation to defund Planned Parenthood. He participated in the forum via video instead. Rubio, a 44-year-old son of Cuban immigrants, is seen by some Republicans as a bright hope for a party desperate to attract younger, more diverse voters. His optimistic, future-focused campaign message already has some Democrats worried that he would be a formidable general election opponent for front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton. I think hes a rising star in the Republican Party, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said. I think it would be worth his time to spend a significant amount of time in the state of Iowa. Some of Rubios rivals have devoted more time to the early voting states this summer. Bush, who is counting on a strong performance in New Hampshire to propel his White House hopes, has made six trips to the state since announcing his campaign in mid-June. Ohio Gov. John Kasich has only officially been in the race for a month, but he has already matched Rubios travel to New Hampshire. Rubio was returning to Iowa this week for an appearance at the state fair Tuesday and the opening of his campaign headquarters in Des Moines on Wednesday. Conant said Rubio would also make stops in New Hampshire, as well as South Carolina and Nevada, by the end of the month.

{"Content": "[ MIAMI (AP)  The Obama administration rebuffed Floridas Gov. Rick Scotts proposal to extend federal funds for hospitals that treat the uninsured, increasing the pressure on states that have refused to expand coverage for low-income people under the presidents health care law. The decision means Floridas already acrimonious state budget process will likely become tenser. The standoff also has implications for eight other states, including Texas, which draw billions of dollars from the same pool of hospital funds. And like Florida, several are also refusing to expand Medicaid coverage. Republican leaders in those states are adamant about not expecting any federal money tied to Obamas Affordable Care Act. Floridas funding is the first to expire on June 30 and Scott has filed a lawsuit, with support from Texas and Kansas, alleging the federal government is breaking the law by coercing states to expand Medicaid in order to get the hospital funds. The hospital funds are an optional program, not entitlement programs like Medicaid, meaning the federal government has broad discretion whether to grant them, experts say. The snub from the Obama administration came Wednesday when Scott met with Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell in Washington. The Republican governor wants the administration to extend $1 billion in low-income pool funds for hospitals, but the federal government wants Florida to expand Medicaid, arguing its more efficient to give people insurance than to pay hospitals for caring for the uninsured retroactively. Neither side has budged. The gridlock stalled Floridas legislative session, prompting the House to abruptly adjourn three days early last week. Scott and lawmakers had asked the Obama administration to bypass a roughly two-month-long required public comment and review period and give a preliminary answer on the funds so lawmakers could agree on a budget when they convene for a special session in June. Burwell declined. The Obama administration also noted in its statement that Florida and other states have known for well over a year that the funds were ending and Florida was granted an extension last year on the condition it seek alternative funding. Its unlikely the federal government will drop the hospital funds entirely, but the Obama administration has been clear that those states will get less funding because the Obama administration will not pay for health care for low-income individuals that would be covered in a Medicaid expansion. Scott told the Obama administration that taking away the money will hurt Florida families, yet the governor refuses to expand Medicaid insurance to more than 800,000 low-income Floridians under a proposal from the Senate that would eventually allow them to buy private insurance. Two years ago, when Scott was getting ready to run for re-election, he spoke in support of Medicaid expansion, calling it a compassionate and common sense solution. Hes since reversed his position, saying Floridians will have to pay a share of it, and that will mean higher taxes. The expansion is fully funded by Washington through 2016, and never dips below 90 percent after. Thats well above what the federal government pays now for the regular Medicaid population. Most Texas Republicans also remain staunchly opposed to Medicaid expansion. The states existing five-year, nearly $30 billion Medicaid waiver  which includes the hospital funds  is set to expire in September 2016. Republican leaders in Tennessees Legislature also oppose Medicaid expansion, even though Gov. Bill Haslam has pushed for it. Texas Rep.

{"Content": "[ MILAN (AP)  An Argentine businessman who was indicted by U.S. authorities in connection to the FIFA corruption case turned himself in to Italian police on Tuesday. Bolzano police official Giuseppe Tricarico told The Associated Press that Alejandro Burzaco arrived at the local police station Tuesday morning with an Italian lawyer and also a Spanish-speaking lawyer. Police spokesman Francesco Bianco later told the AP that Burzaco, who is accused of being involved in a $110 million bribe, was placed under house arrest after a hearing in the northern Italian city. The 50-year-old Burzaco, who has dual Argentine-Italian nationality, has rented a house in Bolzano. Burzaco was one of 14 people indicted by U.S. authorities on May 27 on bribery, vote-rigging and other corruption charges. Seven of the indicted men were arrested during dawn raids on a luxury Zurich hotel. FIFA President Sepp Blatter, who has not been officially implicated in the investigation, won re-election to a fifth, four-term on May 29. But four days later, as the scandal intensified, the 79-year-old Blatter said he would resign and start the process of looking for a successor. In a separate Swiss investigation, authorities seized documents at FIFA headquarters in their probe into the bidding contests for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup tournaments. Burzaco was named on Interpols most wanted list last Wednesday, along with five other men with ties to FIFA. Burzaco and Hugo and Mariano Jinkis, also from Argentina, were named in the U.S. indictment saying they bribed soccer officials in exchange for the media and commercial rights to international tournaments. Argentine Secretary of Security Sergio Berni said Tuesday that the whereabouts of the Jinkis was still unknown. Berni told Radio del Plata that authorities were trying to find them. Burzaco, who is the president of sports marketing company Torneos y Competencias, and the Jinkis merged their companies to form part of Datisa, which obtained the exclusive worldwide rights to the 2015, 2019 and 2023 Copa America tournaments as well as the 2016 centenary edition of the South American championship. The indictment states that Datisa agreed to pay $110 million in bribes to Jeffrey Webb, Eugenio Figueredo, Rafael Esquivel, Jose Maria Marin, Nicolas Leoz and several other soccer officials for the rights. Leoz, a former FIFA executive committee member who is under house arrest in Paraguay, was also named on the Interpol list, as was FIFA vice president Jack Warner and Jose Margulies, a Brazilian broadcast executive. Warner was arrested in Trinidad but has been released on bail.

{"Content": "[ MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  In ways both subtle and blunt, Hillary Rodham Clintons campaign is sending a message to Vice President Joe Biden about his potential presidential campaign: This wont be easy. While Clinton and her team speak warmly of Biden in public, they have taken steps to make clear how theyve taken control of the partys establishment in hopes of discouraging the vice president from entering the race. The latest came Friday in the most public of settings: the Democratic National Committee summer meetings. In a speech to the partys most committed activists, Clinton cast herself as its standard-bearer and vowed to win the presidential race and rebuild the party from the ground up. We are building something that will last long after next November, Clinton told party officials gathered in a Minneapolis ballroom. Other candidates may be fighting for a particular ideology, but Im fighting for you and your families. The speech came after her team rolled out a string of high-profile endorsements in early-voting states and scheduled an onslaught of fundraisers across the country in the effort to ice a Biden bid before he even gets started. Behind the scenes, theyre pressuring donors and delegates to pledge their loyalty to Clinton. Her team sent a slate of top aides to the meeting this weekend armed with pledge cards asking party delegates to commit to Clinton. Donors who have publicly expressed support for a Biden run have later been contacted by the Clinton team, according to fundraisers and Democratic strategists who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the private conversations. Even Clinton herself has made a few calls, they said, to express her disappointment in the defector. Clinton said the over-arching strategy was based on the lessons she learned from her last run, attributing her 2008 primary loss to a failure to capture enough backing from the partys important super delegates  the party and elected officials who are empowered to select the presidential nominee at the Democratic national convention, regardless of what happens in the 2016 primaries. We are working really hard to lock in as many supporters as possible, Clinton told reporters on Friday. This is really about how you put the numbers together to secure the nomination. Clintons chief rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, predicted at the DNC meeting that top leaders would eventually migrate to his campaign. Lets see where we are in three months, Sanders told reporters. Clintons campaign has taken steps in South Carolina, where Biden has deep ties, to showcase her clout. She recently picked up the endorsements of two former governors, Jim Hodges and Dick Riley, the latter who served as education secretary during Bill Clintons administration. During a trip to the Iowa State Fair earlier this month, former Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin joined Clinton and endorsed her campaign. When she returned to Iowa this week, she was joined by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa governor who wrote in an op-ed in the Gazette of Cedar Rapids that he intended to caucus for her, plain and simple. Clintons fundraising apparatus has extensive overlap with Bidens, causing some awkwardness among their donors. I plan on supporting Secretary Clinton. She is the announced candidate, said George Tsunis, a Long Island, New York, businessman and a top donor to Obama and Bidens 2012 re-election campaign. If the vice president were to announce his candidacy and run, I would be supporting the vice president. Clintons campaign, however, is not leaving an opening in fundraising, lining up about three-dozen events in September after the Labor Day holiday. Some of the fundraising receptions will be hosted by leading donors to Obama and Bidens campaigns. In Chicago, Clinton is scheduled to attend fundraisers on Sept. 17 hosted by two longtime Obama supporters, attorney Joseph Power and businessman Michael Polsky. While her husband presides over the annual Clinton Global Initiative meeting in New York in late September, Clinton will raise money at seven fundraisers planned in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Following her West Coast swing, Clinton may attend a fundraiser in Nashville with country music stars Faith Hill and Tim McGraw, but her campaign said late Friday that the event was not yet confirmed. Those advocating for a Biden run say theyll be able to build a vibrant primary organization and have already solicited commitments from a number of Clinton backers who say they are ready to switch sides. They dont want to put their neck out unless they know Biden is in this, said Jon Cooper, finance chairman of the Draft Biden super PAC and a top Obama fundraiser. But I have no doubt hell be able to put together a national fundraising infrastructure in place overnight. He estimated the PAC would raise as much as $3 million over the next few weeks.

{"Content": "[ MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  The Democratic National Committee barely has more cash than it does IOUs, and it is being outraised month after month by its Republican competitor. Its $24 million debt from the 2012 presidential election, only recently paid down, has squeezed investments in the next White House race. Underdeveloped party resources such as voter data files could become a serious disadvantage for the eventual nominee, particularly if that person is not front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton, who would enter a general election contest with her own outreach network. Those fundraising realities are top of mind as Democratic officials, donors and activists meet Thursday through Saturday in Minneapolis. Clinton, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley and former Sen. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island are scheduled to speak to attendees Friday. Federal Election Commission reports tell a disappointing story for the party: The DNC collected $36.5 million in the first six months of the year and had almost no money in special accounts, including one designated for its convention. It had about $7.6 million in available cash and $6.2 million in debts and loans. The Republican National Committee, coming out of years in the red, posted $63 million in receipts through June, leaving it with $16.7 million cash on hand and $1.8 million in debts and loans. Party fundraising dominance has flipped: At this point before the 2012 election, the DNC was outpacing the RNC. Republicans also have been far more active in using the accounts created last year by Congress that enable donors to give at higher levels, investing about eight times what Democrats have. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the DNCs chairwoman, said she isnt worried. We are building the organization now to make sure that whoever our ultimate nominee is, they are in the best possible position to win next November, she said in a statement, and we are confident we will have the resources we need. Raymond Buckley, chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, said that while state parties will always want more, hes happy with the investments the national committee has made across the country. A successful 2016 is going to depend on whats on the ground locally, he said, adding that the DNCs assistance to state parties, in the form of enhanced voter files and leadership training, is light years ahead of where it was in previous years. But the DNCs financial situation has given others pause. The Clinton campaign delayed signing a joint fundraising agreement with the party, in part because of perceived disorganization at the DNC. The next nominee is likely to send a new leadership team to the DNC. On Thursday, the DNC and Clinton campaign completed their joint fundraising plan. The four other Democratic candidates are still in negotiations with the party officials. Such arrangements are mutually beneficial, enabling the nominee to use the partys resources while helping the DNC raise more money to invest in voter outreach and technology. The role of the parties has diminished over the past five years as super PACs and nonprofit policy groups that dont reveal their donors have risen to prominence. Unlike candidates and the political parties, those outside groups arent constrained by contribution limits. Donors now have more choices about where to send their money and often see outside groups as a better way to influence elections. President Barack Obama  the de facto leader of the Democratic Party  has contributed to the array of options. After his 2012 re-election, his campaign formed a policy shop called Organizing for Action rather than folding back into the Democratic National Committee. That group raised about $5 million in the first six months of the year and has maintained control of a social network and data set on millions of Democrats, making it somewhat of a second DNC. The DNC recently began using the groups email list  which at one point included 20 million addresses of Obama supporters  and Democratic officials said Thursday that theyve finalized a way to make it a key piece of infrastructure for the party. President Obama is fully committed to seeing a Democrat elected to the White House in 2016, and hes taking this important step to help make that future a reality, Matt Compton, DNCs digital director, said in a statement. Obama remains a top fundraising draw for the party. He has spoken at 19 DNC fundraisers this year, more than his Republican predecessor George W. Bush did in his seventh year of office. Obama also is on track nearly to match President Bill Clintons prodigious fundraising pace from 1999, when he attended 44 DNC fundraisers. The president is the most effective fundraiser there is, said Brendan Doherty, an associate professor at the U.S. Naval Academy, who researches presidential fundraising. No one in political life is able to command more donors, and no one can better serve the party. The DNC is poised to quicken its fundraising pace. Top party financiers meet Friday in Minneapolis. In late September, the DNC will host an LGBT gala in New York, a major fundraiser. And Democratic presidential debates, which begin in October, also may foster donor interest in the party. __, Follow Julie Bykowicz on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/bykowicz]", "Date": "20150827", "Title": "[Democratic Party lags in money before presidential year]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation-politics/democratic-party-lags-in-money-before-presidential-year/", "Author": "[Julie Bykowicz]"}
{"Content": "[ Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann announced Wednesday that her fourth term in Congress will be her last, choosing to leave on her own terms after a dismal 18 months in which her presidential bid collapsed and she barely managed to retain her House seat. Bachmann, a leading figure in the tea party movement, discussed the decision in a Web video sent to supporters by email. She said her departure was unrelated to ethics inquiries stemming from the failed presidential run and was not influenced by any concerns about my being re-elected. After eight years in Washington, Bachmann left the door open to other political options, though she didnt say what those might be. She was traveling in Russia as part of a congressional delegation and was not available for interviews. It was a sudden turn for Bachmann, the foster-parent-turned-conservative politician whose climb to prominence roughly coincided with the rise of the tea party. She swiftly became a face of the movement and helped found the tea party caucus in the House. But she was also at risk of being left behind as the movement matured. Her departure is part of a larger shift in tea party personalities such as former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, former Rep. Allen West of Florida and former South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint, who have moved over into conservative organizations and commentary roles. Theyve slowly been replaced by a new round of tea party-backed lawmakers such as Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah and Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho. The movement had moved past her to a new round of leaders in Congress and the states around the country, said Dick Wadhams, a Colorado-based Republican strategist. In a short period of time, a new generation has stepped forward since the last election. Ron Carey, a former chief of staff to Bachmann, said he suspects she was anticipating a tough battle ahead and seemed to be stuck in place in Congress. This is a great chance to exit stage right rather than have a knockdown, drag-out re-election fight, said Carey, also an former state GOP chairman. The reality also set in that she is not a favorite of Republican leadership, so she is not going to be rising up to a committee chair or rising up in leadership. In the nine-minute video, Bachmann said her decision was not impacted in any way by the inquiries into her presidential campaign last year. In January, a former Bachmann aide filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, claiming Bachmann made improper payments to an Iowa state senator who was the state chairman of her 2012 presidential run. The aide, Peter Waldron, also accused Bachmann of other FEC violations. Bachmann appeared to be gearing up for a rematch of last falls race against Jim Graves, a hotelier and upstart Democrat who nearly beat her in his first political race. She was raising money as hard as ever and had already launched an ad on Twin Cities television touting her role in opposing President Barack Obamas health care overhaul. Without the polarizing Bachmann on the ticket, Republicans could have an easier time holding a district that leans more heavily in the GOP direction than any other in Minnesota. A parade of hopefuls was expected. Graves said he would press ahead. This is an important moment, but our work is not done, Graves said in a fundraising solicitation. Surely, Representative Bachmanns allies  and their resources  arent going anywhere. Their goal remains the same. Andy Aplikowski, a Republican activist in the district, said he understood her decision. Its a grueling thing to be Michele Bachmann in Congress, he said. Every move you make is criticized and put under a microscope. Bachmanns strongly conservative views propelled her into politics, and once there, she never backed down. She was a suburban mother of five in 1999 when she ran for a Minnesota school board seat because she thought state standards were designed to teach students values and beliefs. She lost that race, but won a state Senate seat a year later. Once in St. Paul, she seized on gay marriage as an issue and led a charge to legally define marriage in Minnesota as between one man and one woman. That failed, but Bachmann had laid the foundation with social conservatives to help send her into Congress in 2006. In Washington, she turned to fiscal issues, attacking Democrats and Obama for government bailouts and health care. Even in her early years in Congress, Bachmann frequently took those views to right-leaning cable talk programs, cultivating her national image and building a formidable fundraising base with like-minded viewers outside Minnesota. But her penchant for provocative rhetoric sometimes backfired. She was hammered in 2008 for saying Obama might have anti-American views, a statement that prompted a rare retreat by Bachmann and made her race that year closer than it would have been. She was also criticized by fellow Republicans last July for making unsubstantiated allegations that an aide to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton had family ties to Egypts Muslim Brotherhood. Her White House bid got off to a promising start, with a win in an Iowa GOP test vote. But Bachmann quickly faded and finished last when the real voting started in Iowas leadoff caucuses, a result that caused her to drop out. Saddled with debt, Bachmann opted to campaign again for her Minnesota seat and squeaked through. But the presidential campaign continued to dog her. Allegations of improper payments prompted ethics inquiries. Bachmann also faced a lawsuit from a former aide who alleged someone on the congresswomans team stole a private email list of home-school supporters for use in the campaign. That case is pending. Bachmanns success in the talk media world has led industry analysts in the past to say she could easily move into a gig as a host. But Amy Kremer, chairman of the Tea Party Express, suggested the congresswoman could seek elected office in the future, perhaps a challenge to Democratic Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota next year or another White House campaign in 2016. I dont think weve seen the last of Congresswoman Bachmann, Kremer said. What she stands for and what the tea party movement stands for  thats not something that just goes away. Pat Klaras, a Republican from suburban Lino Lakes who said she had voted for Bachmann in all her past races, said she was disappointed by Bachmanns decision. She represents my same views, how I feel, how I think, Klaras said. I dont think we have much of that right now. , Thomas reported from Washington.

{"Content": "[ Mississippi has long been one of the sickest and poorest states in America, with some of the highest rates of obesity, diabetes and heart disease and more than 1 in 7 residents without insurance. And so you might think Mississippi would jump at the prospect of billions of federal dollars to expand Medicaid. Youd be wrong. Leaders of the deeply conservative state say that even if Mississippi receives boatloads of cash under President Barack Obamas health care law, it cant afford the corresponding share of state money it will have to put up to add hundreds of thousands of people to the government health insurance program for the poor. While some people say Obamacare will come as an economic boost with `free money, the reality is simple: No money is free, said Republican Gov. Phil Bryant. Since when did the federal government ever give free money without asking for something in return?, GOP Govs. Rick Scott of Florida, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Nathan Deal of Georgia, Nikki Haley of South Carolina and Rick Perry of Texas have said they, too, will reject a Medicaid expansion, calling it too expensive. While many states are wrestling with the issue, perhaps nowhere but Mississippi are the health issues and the politics so stark. Some advocates suspect the governors stand is not about the money at all, but about politics, saying the Republicans are using the Medicaid issue to attack the Obama administration. They point out that the share the states must contribute is relatively small for the amount of federal funding they would receive, and that politicians from those states have eagerly taken big money from Washington for highways, disaster recovery and other projects that required a contribution of state dollars. I think some of this might be posturing before the presidential election, said Michael Doonan, a Brandeis University expert on health care policy and a former aide to Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. Supporters of the expansion say turning down the money for doctors visits, prescriptions and other care would itself be foolish fiscal policy, not only hurting the poor but jeopardizing the jobs of thousands of people at hospitals and other institutions that rely on Medicaid money. The governor and GOP leaders in the Republican-controlled Legislature have argued that the expansion will foster a culture of dependency on government, that its impossible to predict how much revenue Mississippi might collect several years from now, and that there is no guarantee future administrations in Washington will follow through on funding promises. In addition to requiring most Americans to buy insurance, the Obama health care law would expand the number of people on Medicaid by raising the income ceiling for eligibility. A divided Supreme Court this year upheld the law but said the Medicaid expansion would be optional, not mandatory. Some Republican governors are digging in, hoping Mitt Romney will get elected and roll back the law. Under the law, Washington would pay 100 percent of the costs of expanding Medicaid from 2014 to 2016. Between 2017 and 2020, the federal share would decrease to 90 percent and the states contribution would rise in stages to 10 percent, and thats where it would stay. Mississippis governor said that even in the years when Washington is supposed to cover 100 percent, states would still have to pay millions in administrative expenses. The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation has projected that between 2014 and 2019, Mississippi would receive nearly $9.9 billion in federal money for Medicaid expansion, while the state would pay $429 million. Thats $1 from the state for every $23 from Uncle Sam. By some estimates, the expansion would add 400,000 people to the states Medicaid rolls, increasing enrollment from the current 1 in 5 Mississippi residents to about 1 in 3. Mississippi is spending nearly $822 million of its own money on Medicaid in the current fiscal year, or almost 15 percent of the state-funded portion of the overall state budget. Among the estimated 476,000 uninsured Mississippians who could be added to Medicaid is Wilna Alexander, 54, of Jackson. She said she earned $12,000 to $13,000 last year as a part-time cook. She said was on Medicaid but lost coverage more than two years ago when she began working. She said she has never had a regular doctor. Most of the time, when I go to the hospital, I have to be real sick, Alexander said. She said that during one visit to University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, she was found to have strep throat. She had to borrow money to buy antibiotics. The hospital gave her a list of free clinics, but Alexander found that one near her house demanded $80 to see her. Democratic state Sen. Hob Bryan said turning down the money would be wrong. It will mean thousands of jobs for the state and it will mean additional revenue for the state general fund and it will mean hundreds of thousands of people will get better health care, he said. But House Appropriations chairman Rep. Herb Frierson, a Republican, said federal money doesnt fall from the sky: It comes out of somebodys pocket. Ultimately, pressure from politically powerful health care groups might make it difficult for Mississippi leaders to reject the money. Hospital administrators worry that without a Medicaid expansion, they could be saddled with rising costs from treating uninsured patients. I would at least like to see that our state Legislature has examined how it would work instead of saying, `No, its not working for us and we dont even want to try, said Alvin Hoover, CEO of Kings Daughters Medical Center in the small town of Brookhaven. , Associated Press writer Jeff Amy contributed to this report. , Follow Emily Wagster Pettus on Twitter: http://twitter.com/EWagsterPettus]", "Date": "20121019", "Title": "[Miss. says no thanks to Medicaid expansion dollars]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/miss-says-no-thanks-to-medicaid-expansion-dollars/", "Author": "[EMILY WAGSTER PETTUS]"}

{"Content": "[ MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP)  Once a democratic socialist, always a democratic socialist. Once a scold of big money in politics, still a scold. No one can accuse Bernie Sanders of flip-flopping over his four decades in public life. Rock steady, hes inhabited the same ideological corner from which he now takes on Hillary Rodham Clinton in an improbable quest for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. Here he is in 1974, as the 32-year-old candidate for U.S. Senate of a fledgling leftist party in Vermont called Liberty Union: A handful of banks and billionaires control the economic and political life of America.  America is becoming less and less of a democracy and more and more of an oligarchy. And now, in an Associated Press interview: This is a rigged economy, which works for the rich and the powerful, and is not working for ordinary Americans.  You know this country just does not belong to a handful of billionaires. Some see him as a broken record, others as a person who has been telling the truth all along and just waiting for enough people to listen. The fascinating thing about Bernie right now is that the agenda has caught up with Bernie, said Garrison Nelson, a University of Vermont political science professor and longtime Sanders watcher. During Sanders near decade as mayor of Burlington in the 1980s, during his eight terms holding Vermonts lone House seat and during his near decade in the Senate, the message has stayed the same: The rich are absconding with an immorally large part of the countrys wealth, and ordinary people have been getting the short end of the stick. Clinton has gone from opposing same-sex marriage rights to supporting them. Howard Dean, the last Vermont presidential candidate, was a centrist governor who became a liberal representing the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party, when he saw the left flank open in the 2004 primary campaign. Sanders, now 73, favored gay marriage rights before it became fashionable in Democratic circles. He voted against the Defense of Marriage Act in the mid-1990s signed by Clintons husband, President Bill Clinton. Early in her primary campaign, Clinton has spoken about the gap between the rich and the middle class, in an appeal to the partys liberal wing. The Republican contenders, too, are taking up the problem of income inequality, although with much different solutions in mind than the Democrats. Steady-as-he-goes Sanders has been at it for decades. Hes admired Canadas single-payer health care system since way back, talking up nationalized health care during his unsuccessful run for Congress in 1988. When Republicans charge that Democrats would bring European-style socialism to the U.S. Sanders says bring it on. I can hear the Republican attack ad right now: He wants America to look more like Scandinavia, George Stephanopoulos said while interviewing Sanders on ABCs This Week. Sanders replied, Thats right. Thats right. And whats wrong with that? Whats wrong when you have more income and wealth equality? Whats wrong when they have a stronger middle class in many ways than we do, a higher minimum wage than we do, and theyre stronger on the environment?, If hes undergone any transformation, its in his political affiliations. He long ago dropped the Liberty Union banner and has run as an Independent in his successful elections in Vermont. He says he remains one in my heart, but has caucused with Democrats in Congress. He chose to go for the Democratic nomination and, if he loses the party primaries, says he wont run for president as an Independent. In an unsuccessful 1986 race for governor as an Independent, Sanders said, It is time to stop the tweedledee, tweedledum politics of the Republican and Democratic parties.

{"Content": "[ More than 18.6 million Americans in 32 states already have cast ballots in the nations midterm elections, a significant increase over the 2010 early voting, according to data from state elections officials. At least 11 states have exceeded their advance voting totals from the last midterms in 2010, with several more poised to do the same as voters return more absentee ballots and officials tally the final days of in-person advance voting. In 2010, when Republicans regained control the House and swept into power in statehouses across the country, 26.9 million or about 30 percent of the total 89 million ballots were cast before traditional precincts opened. Heres a look at where some states with key races stand this year:, COLORADO, With the count updated through Friday, Republicans maintained an 8.1 percentage point lead over Democrats in the first Colorado election in which every registered voter got their ballots by mail. GOP registrants accounted for 41.4 percent of the returned ballots, compared to 32.3 percent from Democrats. Independent voters sent back 25.3 percent of the total, with 1.1 percent coming from minor party voters. That could be a good sign for Republican Rep. Cory Gardners bid to unseat Democratic Sen. Mark Udall, who was once viewed as a relatively safe incumbent and now could become a key pickup in the GOPs quest for six more seats and a majority. Republican analysts say that they continue to lead Democrats among irregular midterm voters  a target for both parties. The GOP advantage is wider than its 5.6-point margin in 2010. That year, Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet overcame the early deficit to win his seat by 1.7 percentage points or about 30,000 votes. FLORIDA, Democrats continue to chip away at the Republicans usual pre-Election Day lead, as Charlie Crist tries to unseat GOP Gov. Rick Scott. Registered Republicans still have out-voted Democrats, but the margin has dwindled over the last several days to settle at 3.2 percentage points heading into Tuesday. Scott benefited from a 13-point early advantage four years ago, when he won a narrow victory even without a majority. IOWA, Republicans continue their improved push in 2014, narrowing Democrats traditional advantage after watching Democrats use early voting to help President Barack Obama win the state in both of his national victories. The state GOP has made advance voting a priority for its Senate nominee Joni Ernst, who is trying to win the seat opened by Democrat Tom Harkins retirement. As of Monday, the number of ballots received was 108 percent of the 2010 total, with registered Democrats casting 40.9 percent of ballots and Republicans responsible for 39.2 percent. Four years ago, in a GOP wave year, Democrats led the early count by 5.5 percentage points. Democrats say their analyses show they still have attracted more new midterm voters than Republicans, arguing that the GOP boost comes mostly from steering reliable supporters to early ballots, rather than voting on Tuesday, a shift that doesnt change the bottom line. LOUISIANA, With both major parties outperforming their 2010 benchmarks, Democrats account for more than half of the total advance ballots, 19 percentage points ahead of Republicans. But Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu still faces an uphill battle for a fourth term. Republicans say their analysis shows that African-American turnout thus far is not high enough to overcome Landrieus deficit among white voters, including rural and small-town whites who are still registered as Democrats and could account for at least some of the partys early lead. Polls suggest Landrieu will face Rep. Bill Cassidy in Dec. 6 runoff. NORTH CAROLINA  Registered Democrats will go into Election Day having cast 182,000 more ballots than registered Republicans  a gap of 16 percentage points. Democrats say thats an important number for Sen. Kay Hagan, because it comes in part on the strength of African-Americans and women, who account for a larger share of the advance electorate than they did in 2010 and, in the case of black voters, even in 2012, when Obama topped the ballot. Republicans reply: Its still not enough. In 2010, North Carolinas other senator, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, won by 313,000 votes in 2010 even with an advance deficit of more than 95,000 for Republicans. WISCONSIN  With more than 506,000 ballots received as of Monday, Wisconsin has more than doubled its 2010 pre-election turnout, when Republican Scott Walker first claimed the governors seat. This time, hes aiming for a second term that could set up a run for president in 2016.

{"Content": "[ NASHUA, N.H.  The 2016 presidential race is shaping up as an epic struggle between generations. On one side are the baby boomers who came of age in the 1960s and whose generation now is heading toward retirement  Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton, who would be 69 on Election Day and the second-oldest president ever, and Republican Jeb Bush, who would turn 64 soon after becoming president. On the other is a wave of younger faces who came of age in the 1980s, including Republicans Marco Rubio, 43; Ted Cruz, 44; Scott Walker, 47; and Chris Christie and Rand Paul, each 52. Its not just the candidates who make this a generational battle. Its voters. Younger people see the world differently. Theyre far more willing to embrace such social changes as gay marriage and to communicate electronically. Older voters, though, are hardly fading away. They remain determined to see secure Social Security and Medicare systems, a more efficient health-care operation and more direct aid to help struggling workers. Rubio, who would be the third-youngest person to be sworn in as president, suggested a need to hand the baton to his generation when he kicked off his campaign by telling a Miami audience that the generation before him put us at a disadvantage by taxing, borrowing and regulating like its 1999. As he spoke to New Hampshire activists Friday, supporters passed out signs reading, Marco Rubio A New American Century. Clintons announcement video and tours of Iowa and New Hampshire in recent days tried to assure younger people, particularly the racial minorities who make up an important part of the Democratic Partys base, that with governments help they could lead fulfilling middle-class lives while their parents are assured of being comfortable. But her appeal was far less targeted to that generation. Republicans are going out on riskier limbs. Christie last week offered a detailed plan to revamp Social Security and Medicare, including raising the eligibility ages and phasing out Social Security benefits for those earning more than $80,000 from other sources. Few serious presidential candidates would have dared to tinker with those programs even a few years ago. Today, such blueprints are a potentially effective strategy for mobilizing a new wave of voters, those born during and after the Reagan administration. Those younger voters tend to be more conservative and less loyal to any specific political party, said Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, director of Massachusetts-based CIRCLE, which studies young voter trends. Young people would like to be interactive with government, said Kawashima-Ginsberg. They want to see politicians being responsive. Older voters also want responsiveness, but of a different sort. The elderly population is expected to more than double by 2050, with most growth between now and 2030, according to the Census Bureau. We are facing an unprecedented age dependency, people who will rely on Social Security and Medicare, said William Frey, a senior fellow and demographics expert at Washingtons Brookings Institution. Older people tend to vote in bigger numbers and have shown themselves more inclined to support Clinton or Bush. The younger voters are a growing counterforce. Frey noted that the most important element of our demographic transformation is the one occurring at younger ages. Hispanics, blacks and others will replace their aging white counterparts, he said. Frey estimated that in a dozen years, more than half the young adult labor force will be racial minorities. In 2012, voters over 65 were about 16 percent of the electorate, while those under 30 made up about one-fifth. That was a switch from 2004, when about one-fourth of voters were over 65 and 17 percent were under 30. Younger voters go to the polls when motivated, and when they do, they prefer inspirational, nontraditional candidates such as Barack Obama. When not motivated, they stay home. CIRCLE estimated that in 2012, the under-30 vote was decisive in helping Obama win swing states Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Should they be credited with electing the new president, governing could take on a new hue. They have a more complicated way of looking at government, said Matthew Hale, associate professor of political science at Seton Hall University in New Jersey. Theyve grown up in a country where government is largely regarded as bloated, debt-ridden and inefficient. They dont expect to see much help from government programs as they age. They do want government to work in targeted ways, notably by providing educational opportunities and vigorous civil-rights protections for gays, Hispanics, African-Americans and other minorities. And theyre willing to back changes in Social Security and Medicare.]", "Date": "20150421", "Title": "[Generational divide a story line for 2016 presidential race]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/generational-divide-a-story-line-for-2016-presidential-race/", "Author": "[David Lightman]"}
{"Content": "[ NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP)  The prospect of Hillary Rodham Clintons imminent presidential campaign dropped like a gift from the heavens at the National Rifle Associations annual convention Friday. A succession of potential Republican presidential rivals slung criticism and cracked jokes about the Democratic candidate-to-be, and NRA leader Wayne LaPierre, never given to understatement, predicted doom for the nation if she should win. Hillary Rodham Clinton will bring a permanent darkness of deceit and despair forced upon the American people to endure, LaPierre said. The NRA executive vice president and CEO vowed that the powerful gun lobby would stand shoulder to shoulder to prevent her from becoming the next president. Clinton plans to announce her candidacy for the Democratic nomination on Sunday. Many speakers at the NRA convention took the opportunity to say something about it. Is this the ready-for-Hillary gathering? joked Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Many in the capacity crowd at the 4,000-seat ballroom shouted back, No!, Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush decried the liberal, progressive worldview of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder, and all of the other people who want to take the guns out of the hands of the good guys. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker added Clintons name to his criticism of the president. People like Hillary Clinton seem to think you measure success in government by how many people are dependent on the government, he said. I think we measure success by just the opposite: by how many people are no longer dependent on the government. And Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal drew laughter when he said he expects Clintons campaign slogan wont be four more years. The reality is the 2016 campaign is going to be between elitism and populism, Jindal said. Hillary Clinton has already made it clear shell be on the side of elitism. Needling her comment years ago that a vast right-wing conspiracy was making trouble for her husband, President Bill Clinton, Jindal called her leader of the vast left-wing conspiracy. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry didnt name the former secretary of state but criticized our failed foreign policy. Among the other 2016 GOP prospects addressing the convention were Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Most of the speakers criticized Obama for failing to recognize the dangers of what they called radical Islamic terrorism, the presidents nuclear negotiations with Iran and his administrations gun-control efforts. The president has wielded human tragedy in an attempt to subvert our rights, said Rubio, who told the crowd he would announce his decision on a presidential bid in Miami on Monday. The sins of the evil do not justify restricting the rights of the good. Among those not attending: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, whos had a checkered relationship with the gun-rights lobby and received a C rating when he ran for re-election in 2013. None of the speakers at Fridays event had ratings worse than A-minus. Former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence canceled appearances. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who launched his presidential campaign Tuesday, has a top rating from the NRA, but was campaigning in Iowa on Friday. Bush touted a 2005 law he signed as Florida governor allowing people to use deadly force when threatened in public places. The law received attention after the shooting death of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida, in 2012. You shouldnt have to choose between being attacked or going to jail, Bush said. The only thing you should be worried about is keeping yourself and your loved ones safe. Opposing groups plan a rally near the NRA event Saturday to press for more gun safety laws.

{"Content": "[ New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie plans to spend the next year leading efforts to rebuild his home state after Superstorm Sandy  and running for re-election. Christie announced his intention to seek a second term Monday, after telling his campaign treasurer to file papers so he can begin hiring campaign staff, selecting a headquarters and raising money toward his re-election. A formal announcement is expected in January. It would be wrong for me to leave now. I dont want to leave now, Christie, 50, said Monday. We have a job to do. That job wont be finished by next year. The public needs to know that Im in this for the long haul, that the person who has helped to lead them through the initial crisis wants to help lead them through the rebuilding and restoration of our state, he said at a news briefing at a fire house in Middletown, where he had come to thank first responders and volunteers. The gubernatorial election is a year from now. The governor said he talked it over with his wife and four children, ages 9 to 19, over the weekend, and the decision that he should run was unanimous. So far, no one has stepped forward to challenge him as governor. Several Democrats, most prominently Newark Mayor Cory Booker, have been thinking aloud about running for their partys nomination. Christie said he hadnt spoken with Booker other than by text in about 10 days and he didnt know the mayors political intentions. One recent public opinion poll ranked Booker as the Democrat who could come closest to beating the Republican governor. But a new poll released Tuesday shows six out of 10 registered voters now support a second term for Christie, up 15 points since September. The Rutgers-Eagleton poll also found the number of voters opposed to Christies re-election declined from nearly half in September to about a third now. Christie wins every hypothetical head-to-head matchup measured in the poll, including against Booker, who the poll has losing 34-53 percent with 13 percent choosing neither. Christie carried the Democratic-leaning state by 86,000 votes in 2009, an upset win over Democratic incumbent Jon Corzine. Christie, who has become a national figure during his first term, is riding an unprecedented wave of popularity because of how he handled the storm, which he said Friday had caused more than $29 billion in damage in New Jersey. Even Democrats have applauded his hands-on response. He appeared on Saturday Night Live in his trademark fleece pullover this month to lampoon his own nationally televised storm briefings. About the only criticism directed his way since Superstorm Sandy attacked the coast in late October has come from fellow Republicans who have lambasted him for embracing President Barack Obama as the two toured New Jerseys ravaged coastline six days before the presidential election. Some even blame Christie for tipping a close election to the president. Christie was the first governor to endorse Mitt Romney; he raised $18.2 million for the GOP nominee and crisscrossed the country as an in-demand surrogate for Republican candidates. Some are still questioning his party loyalty, however, as they did after Christie delivered the keynote address at the partys nominating convention in Tampa. Critics saw that August speech as too much about Christie and not enough about Romney. The prospect of Christie seeking a second term became likely after he spurned overtures by Republican bigwigs to enter the 2012 presidential contest and more so when he later ruled himself out as vice presidential material with a resounding I love the job I have now. Buzz over a Christie 2016 run has become muted since the governor boarded Marine One with Obama. Christies reputation for bluntness and penchant for confrontation have made him a YouTube sensation and sometimes obscured policy changes he has championed. With the help of Democrats who control both houses of the state Legislature, Christie took on public worker unions, enacting sweeping pension and health benefits changes that cost workers more and are designed to shore up the underfunded public worker retirement and health care systems long term. He also enacted a 2 percent property tax cap with few loopholes to try to slow the annual growth rate of property taxes, already the highest in the nation at an average of $7,519 when adjusted for rebates. Christies education reforms have been slower to accomplish, and Democrats have refused to budge on his signature issue for this year, a phased-in 10 percent tax cut. With tax collections underperforming the administrations projections and storm rebuilding threatening to eat further into revenues, Democrats are unlikely to waver on their position that the state cant afford the cut. Christies handling of the states struggling economy, a potential Achilles heel, has taken a back seat to the storm recovery. But unemployment remains a stubborn 9.7 percent, or 1.6 percent above the national jobless rate, and its too early to tell whether tax collections will rebound to match administration projections for the fiscal year that began in July.]", "Date": "20121127", "Title": "[NJ Gov.

{"Content": "[ NEW YORK  Republican Jeb Bush slow jammed the news, told about meeting his wife, offered a guacamole recipe and oddly compared his presidential father and brother during a Tonight show appearance. One day after announcing his bid for the presidency, Bush entered the entertainment world on the nations most popular late-night talk show. Americans dont expect their presidents to be song-and-dance entertainers, but they at least expect them to appear comfortable and quick-witted opposite television hosts. He was featured Tuesday night on the shows recurring slow jam the news skit with host Jimmy Fallon. The job required Bush to recite lines about his candidacy while Fallon, stylized as a 1970s soul man and backed by the Roots, offered a series of double entendres. Bush took the straight man role that was most often filled by NBCs suspended anchorman, Brian Williams. When soul man Fallon asked about immigration, Bush gave his answer in both English and Spanish. Whoa, hold the telefono, Fallon said. I know you just got back from Miami, but I didnt realize I was interviewing Gov. Pitbull, he said, referencing the Miami-born rapper. Later, an interview with Bush was sandwiched in between appearances by comic Billy Crystal and rock singer Courtney Barnett. Fallon brought up the time Bushs mother, former first lady Barbara Bush, made a comment about having enough Bushes in the White House. Jeb recalled watching the interview. She did it without telling me, he said. Thanks, mom. Shes coming around, thankfully. Asked by Fallon about how he differentiates himself from his father and sibling George W. Bush, Jeb Bush said that former President George H.W. Bush is the most perfect man Ive ever met. My brother, I would say, is a significantly better artist than I am, he said. Bush talked about meeting his wife when he was in Mexico helping to build homes. He knew little Spanish at the time and she didnt know English, but when youre in love you can overcome these problems pretty quickly. Theres another language, he said. In a sense, the appearance was a meeting between two rookies. Bush is new to the national stage, and Fallon is getting ready for his first presidential campaign as a late-night comic in an election where the two most politically savvy late-night hosts, David Letterman and Jon Stewart, will be off the scene. Fallon asked no tough questions and seemed to hold pretty tightly to a script, once impersonating Regis Philbin talking about Bushs campaign signs. Bush is the first candidate of the 2016 cycle to appear on Fallons show. The candidate smiled stiffly during a commercial break as Fallon read a series of promotions to insert in local NBC newscasts that air just before his show. Fallon noted that Tonight had a lot of younger viewers, and wondered what type of message Bush would offer them. I think we need high, sustained economic growth so they can get jobs, he replied.

{"Content": "[ NEW YORK (AP)  Caving to intense Republican lobbying, presidential candidate Donald Trump ruled out the prospect of a third-party White House bid on Thursday and vowed to support whoever wins the partys nomination  a U-turn made easier by his position at the front of the field. The decision follows weeks of behind-the-scenes efforts by GOP leaders, whove been trying to avert the possibility of an independent campaign by Trump ever since last months opening debate, when he refused to promise to back the partys eventual nominee. A third-party bid by Trump, or any prominent conservative, could doom Republican efforts in 2016. I will be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party and the conservative principles for which it stands, Trump said in a news conference at Trump Tower, the gold-hued skyscraper in midtown Manhattan where he launched his surging campaign for president. The 69-year-old billionaire, who announced his decision after meeting with Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, insisted he got absolutely nothing for pledging his loyalty other than the assurance that Ill be treated fairly. In a statement Thursday night, Priebus didnt mention Trump by name but declared his pride in having all major GOP candidates pledging to support the eventual nominee and then took a swipe at the Democratic front-runner. We have the largest, most diverse field in the history of either party, he said. Any candidate would be a better president than Hillary Clinton and offer the new direction Americans want. To the dismay of GOP leaders, Trump has emerged as the overwhelming leader in a crowded field, despite repeatedly insulting key constituencies and offering few details about his policies. The reality television star has described Mexican immigrants as rapists, questioned Sen. John McCains war hero status and insulted a popular Fox News host. His refusal during the partys first debate to pledge his support for the primary campaign winner further roiled the GOP. The document Trump signed Thursday is a pledge, not a contract. Even if it were legally binding, Trumps history in contract law is suspect. When lender Boston Safe Deposit & Trust refused to extend the mortgage on his Palm Beach resort, Mar-a-Lago, he ceased making loan payments until the bank capitulated in 1992. In his book, The Art of the Comeback, Trump proudly recounts forcing his unpaid lenders to choose between fighting him in bankruptcy court or cutting him an additional $65 million check. Afraid of losing their jobs, the bankers folded, Trump says. On Thursday, Trump insisted he would make good on his commitment to Republicans. I see no circumstances under which I would tear up that pledge, he said. If not for Trump, the need for a loyalty oath probably wouldnt exist. There were no doubts about the intentions of the GOPs other major presidential contenders headed into last months debate, and they quickly lined up Thursday to sign the document issued a day earlier by the Republican National Committee. Doug Watts, a spokesman for retired surgeon Ben Carson, another GOP candidate, said the committee felt it had to box Trump into a decision. We just sort of shrugged our shoulders, and thats the end of that, Watts said. Despite Trumps reversal, he succeeded yet again on Thursday in what he has done consistently throughout the race: make the story about him. Even tea party leaders, whove been skeptical of the one-time Democrat, commended him on his political skill. Trump has once again outmaneuvered the GOP, his fellow candidates and the media, said Mark Meckler, a co-founder of the tea party movement. The news is all Donald, all the time. The document signed by Trump asked candidates to promise to endorse the 2016 Republican presidential nominee regardless of who it is. Further, it demanded that each pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate, nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of any other party. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who angrily challenged Trump at the debate over the pledge, took credit for what he termed Trumps capitulation. I spent the last few weeks making sure people knew it was not acceptable to potentially throw the next election to Hillary, Paul wrote on Twitter, referring to Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton.

{"Content": "[ NEW YORK (AP)  Donald Trump always boasted about his ratings for Celebrity Apprentice. Now he can say the same thing about his first presidential debate, even if he didnt like the show very much. Thursdays prime-time GOP candidates forum on Fox News Channel reached a stunning 24 million viewers, by far the largest audience ever for that network and any cable news event. The closest was the 1992 Larry King Live debate between Al Gore and Ross Perot on CNN, which was seen by 16.8 million people, the Nielsen company said. In fact, it stands as the most-watched television program of the summer so far, beating the last game of the NBA Finals and the womens World Cup soccer finals, Nielsen said. The debate left front-runner Trump singed by the aggressive questioning of Foxs moderator team of Bret Baier, Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace. Trump tweeted out criticism of the moderators as not very good or professional and retweeted a message from a supporter who called Kelly a bimbo. Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes called his moderators the best political team ever put on television. Trump became the focus of Thursdays forum right away, when Baier asked the 10 candidates onstage in Cleveland which of them would not pledge to support the eventual GOP nominee or run a third-party candidacy. Trump was the only one to raise his hand, leading opponent Rand Paul to criticize him. Kellys sharp first question noted that Trump had called women he didnt like fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals. When Trump suggested he had only insulted Rosie ODonnell, Kelly corrected him and asked whether this represented the proper temperament for a president and left him vulnerable to charges that he is part of a war on women. Trump pointed to his lack of political correctness. Ive been very nice to you although I could probably not be based on the way youve treated me, Trump told Kelly. But I wouldnt do that. Wallace asked Trump two tough questions and, in a quick-moving format that allowed little time for followups, both times came back at Trump for not answering them. Wallace asked Trump to provide proof for his earlier statement that the Mexican government is sending criminals to the United States, and later questioned him on how he could be trusted to run the nations economy when his companies have declared bankruptcy four times. Baier asked Trump to reconcile his past support of single-payer health care with his opposition to President Obamas health plan, and what he felt he received in return for past political donations to Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi. Kelly also pointed out Trumps past support for Democrats and asked, when did you become a Republican?, I dont think they like me very much, Trump said. Later, Trump wrote on Twitter: I really enjoyed the debate tonight even though the @foxnews trio, especially @megynkelly, was not very good or professional. In another message, he wrote that Kelly really bombed. He retweeted several messages from others who criticized Fox, including one who wrote that Fox viewers give low marks to bimbo @MegynKelly. On Fox after the debate, Kelly noted that it creates an awkward dynamic to have Trump attack her after she has asked a tough question about what he has said and done to women. Im extremely proud of all of the moderators  they asked tough, important questions and did their job as journalists, Ailes told Politico. I think that was the best political debate team ever put on television. Their performance was outstanding. Fox had attracted attention prior to the debate for deciding to include 10 of the 17 declared candidates in the prime-time debate. The other candidates competed in a forum that began at 5 p.m. ET to an audience of one-quarter the size. Still, even the earlier forum attracted a larger audience than all but five of 18 Republican debates televised during the 2012 election cycle. The most-watched GOP primary debate for the 2012 election, on ABC in December 2011, had 7.6 million people, Nielsen said.

{"Content": "[ NEW YORK (AP)  Hillary Rodham Clinton formally kicked off her presidential campaign on Saturday with an enthusiastic embrace of her potential to become the first woman to win the White House, asking supporters gathered at an outdoor rally to join her in building an America where we dont leave anyone out, or anyone behind. With the downtown New York skyline and new World Trade Center over her shoulder, Clinton offered herself as a fierce advocate for those still struggling from the Great Recession. She promised to carry on the liberal legacies of President Barack Obama, and former Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Bill Clinton, her husband, saying real and lasting prosperity must be built by all and shared by all. While Clinton ended her first campaign for president in 2008 by conceding she and her backers werent able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling, she vowed Saturday to push ahead toward an America where a father can tell his daughter: Yes, you can be anything you want to be  even president of the United States. I think you know by now that Ive been called many things by many people, Clinton said to cheers and laughter from the crowd of roughly 5,500 gathering on Roosevelt Island in the East River. Quitter is not one of them. The 67-year-old former secretary of state, first lady and Democratic senator from New York did not make her gender a core element in 2008, but it provided the cap to the first major speech of her 2016 bid. I will be the youngest woman president in the history of the United States. And the first grandmother as well, she said. Two months after starting her campaign with a simple video that showed her only briefly, Clinton outlined a broad vision intended to attract the coalition of young and minority voters that propelled Obama to two victories. In her roughly 45 minute speech, Clinton laid out a wish list of Democratic policies: universal pre-K education, increased regulation of the financial industry, paid sick leave and equal pay for women, a path to citizenship for immigrants living in the country illegally, campaign finance overhaul and a ban on discrimination against gay people and their families. In doing so, Clinton tried to cast the 2016 election as a choice about the economic future of the middle class, saying the Republican field is singing the same old song. The GOPs candidates, she said, want to give Wall Street banks free reign, take away health insurance, turn their backs on gay people and ignore the science of climate change. Fundamentally, they reject what it takes to build an inclusive economy, Clinton said. It takes an inclusive society. What I once called a village that has a place for everyone. Republicans jumped on Clintons decision to cite her ties to Obama and were trying to raise money off the speech almost as soon as it ended. In an email appeal asking for donations, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry wrote, We want to look toward a brighter future, not backward at the failed policies of the Obama-Clinton years. As part of an effort to reintroduce herself to the public, Clinton stressed her career of advocacy  a calling she said was inspired by her mothers difficult upbringing. After the rally, she traveled to Iowa for a house party event Saturday night, where she urged supporters to sign up to help her campaign. The event was streamed online to more than 600 launch parties around the country, part of a tour of early-voting states this week. There, she will focus on her relationship with her mother and her fathers background as a veteran and small businessman. Clinton is the dominant front-runner for the nomination in a race that also includes Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee. Clintons aides said she plans to give a policy address almost every week during the summer and fall. New York has one of the highest rates of income inequality in the country, so Clintons remarks here could foreshadow a campaign that will draw contrasts with rivals over who best can provide de for the countrys economic security. Prosperity cant be just for CEOs and hedge fund managers, Clinton said. You brought our country back, now its time your time to secure the gains and move ahead. Yet the Clinton familys financial history makes some in her party skeptical of her populist credentials. Both Clintons have earned millions in speaking fees, including some from Wall Street banks, and daughter Chelsea and her husband have worked at hedge funds. Clinton spoke about foreign policy for the first time in any significant detail since returning to presidential politics. As Obamas first secretary of state, Clinton said she stood up to Russian leader Vladimir Putin and was in the White House Situation Room the night Osama bin Laden was killed. Here, too, Clinton tried to set herself apart from the more than dozen Republicans who plan to run and have focused, early in the campaign, on the threats the nation faces overseas. There are a lot of trouble spots in the world, but theres a lot of good news out there, too, Clinton said. Clinton remained silent on some issues of critical importance to the Democratic base, most notably a Pacific Rim trade pact backed by Obama but opposed by organized labor, liberals and others who say it will cost the U.S. jobs. The omission didnt go unnoticed in Iowa and New Hampshire, where Sanders and OMalley were campaigning. Both are against the trade deal, and Sanders again hammered Clinton for refusing to say where she stood while touting his support from organized labor. I want to say this: The president is dead wrong on this issue, but he has come out for it, Sanders said. Most Democrats in the Congress are against it. But I dont understand how you dont have a position on this issue.

{"Content": "[ NEW YORK (AP)  Nike Chairman Phil Knight, who turned a business selling shoes out of the back of his car into the worlds most valuable sports brand, has announced plans to step down as company chairman. Knight, 77, was a middle distance runner in college who began the company in a handshake deal with Oregon coach Bill Bowerman in 1964, with each putting up $500. With shrewd marketing campaigns built around celebrity endorsers like Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods, he made the swoosh one of the most recognizable logos around the globe. That phenomenal growth also landed Knight on Forbes magazines list of 50 richest people in the world, with a net worth estimated at $24 billion. For me, Nike has always been more than just a company  it has been my lifes passion, Knight said in a statement. Knight said he wants Nike President and CEO Mark Parker, who has held those positions since 2006, to succeed him. No specific date was set for Knights departure, though he said he plans to stay involved in the business. Nike Inc. said it expects to name a new chairman in 2016. Knight sold his first pairs of shoes out of an old Plymouth Valiant while traveling the same Pacific Northwest track circuit on which he once competed. The company was originally named Blue Ribbon Sports, but changed in 1978 to Nike  the winged goddess of victory in Greek mythology  on the advice of a friend. Knight said at the time, I dont love it, but it will grow on me. By 1969, Knight was making enough selling shoes to quit his full-time job as an accountant and devote himself to the footwear company. Two years later, he paid $35 to Carolyn Davidson for the original swoosh logo design now plastered across the uniforms and shoes of athletes from the World Cup to little leagues. Building the brand through shrewd advertising campaigns and top-flight celebrity athlete endorsers like Jordan and Woods, he turned the company into what Forbes called the most valuable sports brand in the world. Knight also says he will transfer most of his Nike stock to a limited liability company called Swoosh LLC. The directors of the company will be Knight himself, Parker, and Nike directors Alan Graf and John Donahoe. On Tuesday, Knight said he had transferred 128.5 million shares, or about 15 percent of Nikes total outstanding shares, to Swoosh. Because Knight owns a large amount of Nikes Class A shares, which arent publicly traded, Swoosh now has the power to elect three-quarters of Nikes board. Knight says the move will help keep Nikes corporate governance strong. As of a year ago, Knight owned about 75 percent of Nikes Class A shares and a fraction of a percent of its Class B shares. The Class B shares are currently trading around all-time highs and closed at $108.02 on Tuesday. On Thursday, Nike said its annual profit grew 22 percent to $3.27 billion and its revenue rose 10 percent to $30.6 billion.

{"Content": "[ NEW YORK (AP)  President Barack Obama will impose even steeper cuts on greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. power plants than previously expected, senior administration officials said Sunday, in what the president called the most significant step the U.S. has ever taken to fight global warming. A year after proposing unprecedented carbon dioxide limits, the Obama administration was poised to finalize the rule at a White House event on Monday. Obama, in a video posted to Facebook, said the limits were backed up by decades of data and facts showing that without tough action, the world will face more extreme weather and escalating health problems like asthma. Climate change is not a problem for another generation, Obama said. Not anymore. In his initial proposal, Obama had mandated a 30 percent nationwide cut in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. The final version, which follows extensive consultations with environmental groups and the energy industry, will require a 32 percent cut instead, according to Obama administration officials, who werent authorized to comment by name and requested anonymity. Opponents said they would sue the government immediately. They also planned to ask the courts to put the rule on hold while legal challenges play out. The final version also gives states an additional two years  until 2022  to comply, officials said, yielding to complaints that the original deadline was too soon. States will also have until 2018 instead of 2017 to submit their plans for how they intend to meet their targets. But the administration will attempt to incentivize states to take action earlier by offering credits to states that boost renewable sources like wind and solar in 2020 and 2021, officials said. The focus on renewables marks a significant shift from the earlier version that sought to accelerate the ongoing shift from coal-fired power to natural gas, which emits far less carbon dioxide. The final rule aims to keep the share of natural gas in the nations power mix the same as it is now. The stricter limits included in the final plan were certain to incense energy industry advocates who had already balked at the more lenient limits in the proposed plan. But the Obama administration said its tweaks would cut energy costs and address concerns about power grid reliability. The Obama administration previously predicted the emissions limits will cost up to $8.8 billion annually by 2030, although it says those costs will be far outweighed by health savings from fewer asthma attacks and other benefits. The actual price wont be clear until states decide how theyll reach their targets, but the administration has projected the rule would raise electricity prices about 4.9 percent by 2020 and prompt coal-fired power plants to close. In the works for years, the power plant rule forms the cornerstone of Obamas plan to curb U.S. emissions and keep global temperatures from climbing, and its success is pivotal to the legacy Obama hopes to leave on climate change. Never before has the U.S. sought to restrict carbon dioxide from existing power plants. By clamping down on power plant emissions, Obama is also working to increase his leverage and credibility with other nations whose commitments hes seeking for a global climate treaty to be finalized later this year in Paris. As its contribution to that treaty, the U.S. has pledged to cut overall emissions 26 percent to 28 percent by 2025, compared to 2005. Other major polluting nations have also stepped up including China, which pledged to halt its growth in emissions by 2030 despite an economy thats still growing. Americas largest source of greenhouse gases, power plants account for roughly one-third of all U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming. Obamas rule assigns customized targets to each state, then leaves it up to the state to determine how to meet their targets. Even before the rule was finalized, more than a dozen states announced plans to fight it. At the urging of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, some Republican governors have declared theyll simply refuse to comply, setting up a certain confrontation with the EPA, which by law can force its own plan on states that fail to submit implementation plans. Yet even in many of those states, power companies and local utility authorities have started preparing plans to meet the targets. New, more efficient plants that are replacing older and dirtier ones have already pushed emissions down nearly 13 percent since 2005, putting them about halfway to meeting Obamas goal. In Congress, lawmakers have sought to use legislation to stop Obamas regulation, and McConnell has tried previously to use an obscure, rarely successful maneuver under the Congressional Review Act to allow Congress to vote it down. The more serious threat to Obamas rule will likely come in the courts. The Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, which represents energy companies, said 20 to 30 states were poised to join with industry in suing over the rule. The Obama administration has a mixed track record in fending off legal challenges to its climate rules. Earlier this year, a federal appeals court ruled against 15 states and a coal company that tried to block the power plant rule before it was finalized. The Supreme Court has also affirmed Obamas authority to regulate pollution crossing state lines and to use the decades-old Clean Air Act to reduce greenhouse gases  the legal underpinning for the power plant rule. But the high court in June ruled against his mercury emissions limits, arguing the EPA failed to properly account for costs. Federal courts have also forced Obama to redo other clean air standards that industry groups complained were too onerous. With the end of Obamas presidency drawing nearer, his climate efforts have become increasingly entangled in the next presidential election. The power plant rule wont go into effect until long after Obama leaves office, putting its implementation in the hands of his successor. Among other Republican critics, 2016 candidate and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has said he would drastically scale down the EPA if elected and shift most of its duties to state regulators.

{"Content": "[ NEWARK, N.J. (AP)  Federal prosecutors brought charges Friday against three former allies of Gov. Chris Christie  but not Christie himself  in the George Washington Bridge traffic scandal, apparently easing the legal threat that has hung over his 2016 White House ambitions for more than a year. One of those charged, David Wildstein, a former high-ranking official at the transportation agency that operates the bridge, pleaded guilty in a deal with prosecutors, saying he and the other defendants engineered huge traffic jams to get even with a local politician. Christie was not implicated in court or in the indictments. Based on the evidence currently available to us, were not going to charge anyone else in this scheme, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said at a news conference. The Republican governor claimed vindication. Todays charges make clear that what Ive said from day one is true  I had no knowledge or involvement in the planning or execution of this act, Christie said in a statement. While Christie may be out of any immediate legal danger, politically it could be more complicated. The furor has already damaged his standing in the polls, and the charges put the scandal back in the news just as the presidential cycle is getting underway and candidates are jumping into the race. Wildstein, a former official at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, pleaded guilty to conspiracy, saying he and the other Christie loyalists closed lanes and created gridlock in September 2013 as political payback against a Democratic mayor. He said the three of them also concocted a cover story: It was a traffic study. The two people he implicated  former Christie deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly and Bill Baroni, who was the governors top appointee at the Port Authority  were charged with fraud, conspiracy and other offenses in an indictment unsealed later in the day. Wildstein, 53, has been cooperating with prosecutors for months. He could face about two years in prison at sentencing Aug. 6. The charges against Kelly and Baroni carry much heavier penalties if they are convicted. Essentially, the three defendants were accused of misusing public resources for political gain. They callously victimized people who were just trying to get to school or go to work, Fishman said. Wildstein gave no indication in court that Christie had any role in the scheme. But after the hearing, his lawyer, Alan Zegas, reiterated a claim he made last year that theres evidence that Christie knew about it as it happened. He did not go into detail. Brigid Harrison, a political science professor at New Jerseys Montclair State University, said the charges are bad news for Christie. I would go so far as to say that this really signals a death knell to his presidential aspirations, she said. You have key staffers who have been indicted, and one of the things that primary voters look to is: How would a prospective president manage their staff?, But Fergus Cullen, former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party, said he does not expect a major effect: People have already made up their minds as to whether they think its a deal or not. Some Christie foes have suggested that even if he had no direct role in the plot, his bruising political style created a culture that led members of his administration to think they could get away with such tactics. Asked about that, Fishman said: I wont comment on culture. State Assemblyman John Wisniewski, a Democrat who is co-chairman of a committee investigating the scandal, said that with Wildsteins guilty plea, the people of New Jersey have more reason to be skeptical of Gov. Christies leadership style built upon bullying and retaliation. Baronis lawyer, Michael Baldassare, said that Baroni will be fully exonerated and that Wildstein is a habitual liar. Kelly emphatically denied any wrongdoing and said she will work relentlessly to clear her name. I never ordered or conspired with David Wildstein to close or realign lanes of the bridge for any reason, much less for retribution, she said. She also said that she texted and emailed things that she meant to be funny  but now sees that they were not. The scandal broke wide open more than a year ago when an email from Kelly to Wildstein was revealed. It read, Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee. Wildsteins reply: Got it. That exchange was key in the indictment. The closing of two of three access lanes caused monumental, bumper-to-bumper tie-ups at the George Washington Bridge, which links New Jersey to New York City and is the busiest span in the world. School buses and emergency vehicles were held up, and commuters were stuck in traffic for hours over four mornings. Wildstein said they orchestrated the lane closings to start on the first day of school to punish Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich for not endorsing Christies re-election bid. Fort Lee sits at the foot of the bridge. Christie has called the scheme stupid and ridiculed the notion that he was even interested in an endorsement from Sokolich. The governor coasted to re-election in the fall of 2013. On Friday, Sokolich said the allegations that he was the target of political retribution were a true punch in the gut. I didnt sign up for this, he said. I signed up to open up Little League fields and lower taxes. As the scandal unfolded more than a year ago, Wildstein and Baroni resigned, and the governor fired Kelly and cut ties with Bill Stepien, his two-time campaign manager. Stepien was not indicted.

{"Content": "[ No sir. This is not going to be a column about New Years resolutions for Congress. We all know that the paper they would be written on, or the digital energy, would be wasted. This is about resolutions for the rest of us, we the people, regarding our civic duties. This is going to be an important election year. (This of course implies that some elections are not important, a thought you will never hear on Fox News or MSNBC.) In November, all the members of the U.S. House and one-third of the U.S. Senate must stand for re-election. That could determine many of the issues we have been debating for years. We should resolve not to throw all the bums out. We need some for institutional memory and parliamentary know-how. Otherwise, smart-alecky staffs would run everything. But we should consider unelecting those who thwart the will of the majority, and those who hate government and seek to undermine it and worry about the presidents birth certificate. Let them become stockbrokers or motivational speakers. We should try to resist pouring vituperation on Obamacare until it is implemented and we find out if it works. It is exhausting having to hate something so intensely all the time. Imagine if Republicans had another issue to get all hot and bothered about! Just think of 40 consecutive votes on climate change!, We really should not start the 2016 presidential election until 2015 at the earliest. Perhaps it would be refreshing to refrain from focusing laserlike attention on Hillary Rodham Clinton and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for a few months. Otherwise we would lapse into terminal boredom, although it is fascinating to watch Clintons ever-changing hairstyles and listen to Christies wisecracks. This is a longshot, but think how different our lives would be if we didnt have to get so upset about politics every day that we have to take anti-nausea medicine and avoid certain people who think differently (wrongly) from us. Wow! Imagine a country in which we could have civil discourse about such issues as immigration and the environment and taxes. Well, maybe not taxes. Perhaps we could resolve to find out more about the issues and uncover facts, read more newspapers (yes, this is a commercial) and online news. How cool if everyone could agree on the basics, such as how a bill becomes a law or the true nature of filibusters. And we could demand that our children take mandatory classes in civics and history again. It seems that many foreign children know more about U.S. history than many of our children do. Every child should know, for example, that the Fourth of July should actually be celebrated on July 2. We should always remember that we have thousands of men and women in uniform who make daily sacrifices for the rest of us. We should never forget that thousands have been killed and maimed. We should resolve to do all that we can to make life better for the survivors and their families and we should honor the families of those who gave up their lives. We should resolve to make it easier, not harder, for our citizens to vote. We should expand voting hours, not restrict them. We should organize carpools to get people to the polls. We should not make senior citizens who have been voting for decades spend time and effort to retrieve long-lost birth certificates in order to vote. We should rejoice that people of all shapes, sizes and colors want to vote. As exemplary citizens, we should all lose weight, exercise, eat more fruit and vegetables and get plenty of rest. Finally, we should resolve not to keep alive all those poinsettias we collected over the holidays. By mid-January, we are saddened by those spindly stalks and shedding, dessicated leaves.

{"Content": "[ NORWAY just held a federal election. Almost 80 percent of eligible voters cast ballots. Germany just held a federal election. Seventy-two percent of eligible voters cast ballots. Those are not outlier numbers. Most countries that the United States would compare itself with register dramatically higher turnout rates than those posted in our federal elections. Roughly 53 percent of the voting-age population participated in the 2012 U.S. presidential elections. In this country, roughly 37 percent participated in the most recent off-year congressional election  the 2010 contest that saw Republicans take control of the U.S. House and most state houses. The U.S. now ranks No. 21 in the The Economists annual Democracy Index, with especially low marks for political participation. On the indexs scale of one to 10, the U.S. gets an 8.1 rating, just one-tenth of a point above the line the analysts draw to separate fully functional democracies from those experiencing notable dysfunction. There can no longer be any question that free and fair elections  what we were raised to believe was an American democratic birthright  are effectively being taken away from the people. Billionaires, corporations, the politicians who do their bidding and the media conglomerates that facilitate the abuse are sapping elections of their meaning and of their democratic potential. The Money Power  as Teddy Roosevelt and his progressive contemporaries termed the collaboration that imposed the will of wealth on our politics  achieves its ends by flooding the electoral system with an unprecedented tidal wave of unaccountable spending. That money makes a mockery of political equality in the voting booth. The determination of media companies to cash in on that mockery  when they should instead be exposing and opposing it  completes a vicious circle. This is not an entirely new phenomenon. But it is an accelerating phenomenon, with spending in 2012 hitting the $10 billion mark. The U.S. Supreme Courts 2010 Citizens United decision allowing unlimited corporate campaign spending confirmed the court-ordered diminution of democratic processes. But, as law professor Lawrence Lessig notes, The day before Citizens United was decided, our democracy was already broken. Citizens United may have shot the body, but the body was already cold. Self-interested donors, corporations and their political pawns are grasping for total power. If they did not succeed in choking off every avenue of dissent in 2012, they will surely return, with increased determination and more insidious tactics in 2014, 2016 and beyond. We have one of the worst election processes in the world right in the United States of America, former President Jimmy Carter said in 2012, and its almost entirely because of the excessive influx of money. The owners of media corporations have made their pact with the new order. For the most part, they do not challenge it. Rather, managers position media outlets to reap windfall profits through the broadcasting of inane and crudely negative political campaign advertising, which is now the lingua franca of American electioneering. To talk about the crisis of money in politics without addressing the mess that the media have made of things is the equivalent of talking about the deliberate fire without discussing the arsonist. The emerging money-and-media election complex has become so vast and so powerful that it can best be understood as an entity unto itself. It is this complex that defines our politics, largely through negative ads. In some high-stakes races, these ads account for more than 90 percent of the political communications on radio and television. This sort of advertising, which is banned in many countries that seek and achieve high voter turnout, represents a form of voter suppression every bit as noxious as a restrictive voter ID law. An onslaught of negative advertising  in the absence of serious journalism and serious debate  repulses potential voters. That repulsion discourages participation by the voters who are most likely to demand better; as such, the negative ads benefit a status quo that is renewing the social and economic inequality that defined the Gilded Age. The response of the progressives of a century ago to political structures and practices that promoted that sort of inequality was a demand for fundamental reform that would open up the process and make the vote matter more than the dollar. If we hope to ever again see meaningful, high-turnout elections in the United States, Americans must demand nothing less. The demands are already being made at the grass-roots level. Tuesday is Election Day in Seattle and voters will have an opportunity to reform how local democracy works. Proposition 1 would establish a public-financing system, creating a property-tax levy that would provide City Council candidates who raise small amounts of money from Seattle residents with a $6-to-$1 match. Another proposal, Charter Amendment 19, would convert some at-large City Council seats to district-based seats, making it easier for candidates who do not have a lot of money to run and win with community-based, door-to-door campaigns. These are important steps, but they will not be sufficient to reverse the slide toward dollarocracy. A year ago, President Obama (no slouch in the fundraising department) responded to a question about money in politics by saying, I think we need to seriously consider mobilizing a constitutional amendment process to overturn Citizens United  , The people are ahead of their president on this one. Sixteen states have already formally called on Congress (via ballot measures, legislative or official letters signed by a majority of state legislators) to begin the process of amending the Constitution to address the damage that is being done. In todays campaigns, money no longer merely speaks  it shouts. In March, the Washington state House voted 55-42 in favor of a resolution written by state Rep. Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, that seeks a federal amendment to restore the authority to regulate election campaign contributions to Congress and state legislatures. That measure is now pending in the state Senate, as are similar resolutions in states across the country. Too much of our media and too many of our politicians remain focused on the failure of our politics that is on display in Washington, D.C. The real story is playing out at the grass-roots level. Americans are demanding reform. And those demands are essential if the United States is to avert dollarocracy and embrace democracy. John Nichols of Washington, D.C. and Robert W.

{"Content": "[ OLYMPIA  As state Sen. Andy Hill stuck to his message over months of budget negotiations  new taxes only as a last resort  he watched the Democrats revenue proposals melt away. First went Gov. Jay Inslees proposed carbon-emissions tax, never adopted in a legislative budget proposal. House Democratic proposals for a business-and-occupation tax hike and a new capital-gains tax also evaporated. In the end, even several tax exemptions closed in the new $38.2 billion state operating budget  a compromise made with Democrats to raise some revenue  were chosen by Republicans. A 53-year-old, soccer-loving Harvard MBA and former Microsoft group manager from Redmond, Hill played the public face of the GOP message during the grueling, extended legislative season that ended Friday. Reality was simple, argued the chief Republican budget writer: New revenue from existing taxes should be enough to cover the cost of government. He repeated it over and over, in news conferences and interviews, like a looped recording. Whether it was political acumen or just the luck of pushing the same hold-the-line message as revenue reports brought the money in  Hill and his Republican colleagues emerged crowing about a budget that cut college tuition, put more money toward education and raised little new revenue. We think that when we started in January, we had a set of priorities, Hill said the day the budget compromise was released. And we believe we delivered on all of them. Now Hill, first elected in 2010, is getting what comes with a successful GOP run in Olympia: chatter that he could be the partys best hope for challenging Inslee in 2016, and Democratic criticism that Republicans remain too conservative for many. Back in January, the budget that came to be didnt necessarily seem plausible. Lawmakers began work under an unprecedented series of obligations. They were being held in contempt for not doing enough to fully plan to fund K-12 education under the state Supreme Courts McCleary decision. Other court orders were forcing legislators to better fund mental-health and foster-care programs. Legislators also wanted to give government workers and school employees their first cost-of-living raises in years. There were questions over how to repair the social-safety net and make college more affordable  two areas that had taken a hit during the Great Recession. During the prolonged stalemate over the budget, the ground shifted. Two economic forecasts and newfound federal money brought projections of more than $750 million through 2017. Buoyed by timing and luck, the GOP stood vindicated. That windfall helped build a budget that some are calling historic for its investments in early learning and K-12 education funding, and mental-health and social-service improvements. The budget, signed by Inslee shortly before midnight on June 30, included the cost-of-living pay raises and also boosted funding for state parks. It also bought a unique policy, sought by Republicans  a tuition cut for state colleges and universities. While that proposal had been pushed earlier by others in the GOP, Senate Majority Leader Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville, said Hill helped make it possible. When Andy Hill showed us the savings and resources we could use to write a budget with, said Schoesler, he showed us we could afford a tuition cut. The narrative about this years session, however, is more complex than the headlines. Democrats panned Hills budget proposals as full of gimmicks that moved money between accounts and underfunded services such as mental-health programs and the states health-care insurance exchange. The budget that eventually got written could not have been done without $500 million to $700 million worth of positive economic news, said Rep. Ross Hunter of Medina, the chief Democratic budget writer. Democrats said they had to fight up until the end of negotiations to make sure the GOPs tuition cut was properly funded, as were needed mental-health improvements, according to Hunter. But former state Republican party chairman Chris Vance praised Hill and Senate Republicans for fighting to cut tuition at state universities  a move he said reversed years of declining state support under Democratic administrations while also appealing to middle-class voters needed by the GOP to win statewide. It is in some ways one of the quintessential cul-de-sac suburban issues, Vance said. Republicans have to do better in the suburbs to make up for what they lose in Seattle. Could Hill succeed where moderate Republican gubernatorial hopefuls like Rob McKenna and Dino Rossi fell short?, Hill hasnt signaled what hell do. Im still getting over the budget hangover, he said. Sitting outside a Bellevue Starbucks one afternoon, Hill heaps praise on Schoesler and Sen. John Braun, R-Centralia, for their roles in budget talks. And he coolly assesses the Democrats political situation during the session. I think this was one of the problems the Democrats had, is that the expectations were so high, Hill said. That we would get all these taxes and we would do all this spending, I just think they were unrealistic in any scenario. But again, we werent fighting over making draconian cuts, he added. We were fighting over how much to expand government and where to spend extra money. Hills job of selling the Republican argument started even before the session. He served as point man to push back against the budget customarily proposed by the governor in December. Tax increases should be the last resort, not the first response, Hill said in a statement responding to Inslees proposal to raise $1.4 billion in new revenue. Once the session began in January, Hill explained to the public every new GOP proposal and hit back against every Democratic plan. And in April, as the regular 105-day session drew to a close, Hill called on House Democrats to take floor votes on the $1.5 billion in taxes they sought. If Democrats couldnt muster that support, budget negotiators would just be talking about phantom money, Hill said at the time, adding: Its all about setting the bargaining points. The move delayed budget talks and resulted in a special session in May that essentially became a 30-day stalemate. Democrats never took votes on the House floor for proposed hikes in parts of the business-and-occupation tax and new capital-gains tax. Even as Republicans insisted that any government shutdown  which would happen if the state didnt have a new budget by July 1  should be considered the fault of Democrats, they werent shy about going right up to the line. The constituents I talk to, theyd much rather us hold the line on $1.5 billion in new taxes and bear the expense of a few extra days in special session, Braun said in a news conference in late May. Hill added, around that time, We want to make sure we get things done right. Democrats and Republicans finally reached a deal with only days to spare. Inslee signed the new budget at about 11:40 p.m. June 30  20 minutes before a shutdown would have occurred. Hill ascended to the powerful position of Senate Ways and Means chairman in 2013 because of his educational background  and because more experienced Republicans were busy with other roles, according to Schoesler. Hes an amazingly fast study, said Schoesler. Budget writers can live or die by a lot of small decisions, and youve got a ton of those to go through. Former Senate Majority Leader Rodney Tom describes Hill as quiet smart. Hes pretty practical and hes solutions-driven, said Tom, who in 2012 was one of two Democrats who crossed the aisle to work with Republicans. People may not know that a budget writer isnt just some guy in a room whos doing what he wants, said Tom. Hill has to negotiate with Democrats while simultaneously keeping his fellow members and Schoesler comfortable with changes in policy. Andy has to keep Mark happy, and Mark has to keep the caucus happy, said Tom. For a party that spans from the rock-ribbed conservative eastern half of the state to a more moderate segment west of the Cascades, Republicans arent always in agreement. Hill has to work with more conservative senators, like a trio who after one revenue forecast proposed using some of the extra money to cut business taxes rather than firm up the budget. Andy has a lot of members where, even if it makes sense, they dont want to spend the money, said Tom. Theres a contingent of the Republican Party thats Jeffersonian, they really want smaller government. As Hill gets mentioned as a possible Inslee challenger next year, so do state Sen. Steve Litzow, R-Mercer Island, who chairs the Senate Education Committee, and U.S. Rep. Dave Reichert, R-Auburn. Port of Seattle Commissioner Bill Bryant has a head start  he declared his candidacy in May. Whether or not Hill runs, Vance called his record as budget writer the kind of model that can win in Washington state. But Democratic political consultant Christian Sinderman hits back against Hills image as a suburban moderate, calling him an ideological conservative cloaked in suburban soccer-dad apparel. Environmentalists accuse Hill and the Senate Republican majority of siding with fossil-fuel interests and opposing legislation aimed at fighting climate change, including Inslees proposed cap-and-trade plan to limit carbon emissions through charges on big polluters. The Senate also refused to close a tax loophole benefiting oil refineries. There was a chance for real bipartisan progress this session. He chose to serve the interests of Big Oil, rather than the interests of Washingtonians, said Shannon Murphy, president of Washington Conservation Voters, which spent big to try to defeat Hills re-election bid. Hill has been among the biggest recipients of oil- and gas-industry campaign contributions among Washington legislators since 2012, according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics. California billionaire and Inslee ally Tom Steyer unsuccessfully took aim at Hill as one of a handful of Republican senators to unseat in order to bring about a Legislature more friendly to climate change. Hill, who drives a BMW electric car, said the Legislature didnt act on climate change this year because lawmakers had too much else to do. In conversation, Hill is reluctant to take shots at Inslee. But, I do think we need new leadership, he said. To win a statewide election, Hill repeats the wisdom that a Republican candidate needs to draw enough votes in suburban King County to offset the large urban blocks that vote Democratic. Just like his constituents in Duvall, Woodinville, and parts of Kirkland and Redmond. Generally, the suburban voters  their view is Educate my kids, be smart with my money and leave everybody else alone,  he said. In a lot of ways it is a socially moderate and a fiscally conservative viewpoint. And I kind of fit that, Hill adds later. That fits my district well.]", "Date": "20150711", "Title": "[Sen.

{"Content": "[ OLYMPIA  Many people would be thrilled to get an 11 percent pay raise over two years. But if youre a Washington state lawmaker, stuck in a special session over budget disagreements and likely to hand out far smaller pay hikes to teachers and state workers, its kind of awkward.

Its just an incredibly awkward situation, said Rep. Matt Manweller, R-Ellensburg. The Washington Citizens Commission on Salaries for Elected Officials  which has sole authority to set pay for lawmakers and statewide elected officials  approved a series of pay increases on Wednesday that also included the governor and judges. The commission, a nonpartisan group of citizens from the states 10 congressional districts, as well as other experts, approved the increase for legislators on a 10-5 vote. We thought there was some catching up to do, board member Melissa Albert said. We dont want to have a Legislature made up of only people who are independently wealthy.

The raise  the first since 2008 and fleshed out over months of study and discussion  came after two proposals for smaller increases for state lawmakers failed. The new pay schedule comes as legislators are halfway through a special session to negotiate a two-year state operating budget that is expected to include raises for state workers and teachers far short of 11 percent. Negotiated or arbitrated contracts, which must be approved by lawmakers, would raise most state worker pay by about 5 percent over two years. Reykdal said lawmaker salaries shouldnt be set until after the Legislature decides on those contracts and teacher pay increases. Manweller said there were good intentions behind setting up the independent salary commission to depoliticize lawmaker pay, but, I dont know if its worked. This is a situation where I did not ask for it (a raise), I have no control over it, he said. And yet I am going to get beat up for it, regardless. The new pay schedule increases the pay of a legislator to $46,839 a year by September 2016. They currently make $42,106. The four legislators in leadership earn $4,000 to $8,000 annually more. In arriving at pay, the commission looks at a wealth of data, including compensation for lawmakers in other states and cost-of-living studies. Gregory Dallaire, a salary- commission member, said it would be a different matter to give such a large pay hike if all lawmakers were making $50,000 or $60,000 a year. But, the salarys low already, Dallaire said. In 2014, Washington state lawmakers ranked 14th nationally in annual pay, according to a report by The Pew Charitable Trusts. Comparing states is tricky: Some states have full-time legislators while others are in session less than Washington state. Washingtons is considered a part-time Legislature. This years regular, budget-writing session lasted 105 days, and lawmakers are now in the middle of a 30-day special session trying to finish the job. Legislators in California earn the most: $90,526 a year. In New Mexico, lawmakers draw no salary and get $159 a day for expenses while in session, known as a per diem. Many states offer a per diem in addition to salaries; in Washington, lawmakers can claim $120 a day for expenses. You can judge the sentiment among some people over the pay raises by the number of capitalized words found in the written public comments collected by the salary commission. They can have the same percentage those cheapskates are going to give the REAL state workers, wrote one commenter. Wrote another: CANNOT FUND education programs to reduce class sizes  BUT there is money in the coffers for an 11.2% raise. Wow. Government is NOT about the people anymore, is it. While not advocating for any particular proposal, Senate Democratic Minority Leader Sharon Nelson, of Maury Island, told the commission in January that competitive pay helps retain lawmakers and the expertise they develop to work on complicated issues. Without that expertise, Nelson said, special-interest lobbyists gain greater influence in Olympia. Its a check and balance that comes into play daily, she said. The commission also approved raises for all nine statewide elected officials, as well as state Supreme Court justices and Superior Court, District Court and Court of Appeals judges. Gov. Jay Inslee will receive a 4 percent increase over two years, to $173,617 from the current salary of $166,891. The new salary schedule will likely be delivered to the state Secretary of States Office sometime in late May, according to David Ammons, spokesman for the office. At that point, members of the public wishing to challenge the decision have a 90-day window to file a referendum and collect 124,000 signatures to put the issue on the November general-election ballot.]", "Date": "20150513", "Title": "[Horrific timing: 11.2% pay raise for Washington lawmakers]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/commission-approves-11-pay-hike-for-state-lawmakers/", "Author": "[Joseph OSullivan]"}
{"Content": "[ OLYMPIA  To picture how political foes may seek to use Gov. Jay Inslees death-penalty moratorium against him, look back at   one of the last television ads of the 2012 state attorney generals race:, Horror music twinkles as a sepia-toned photo of Democrat Bob Ferguson appears alongside a Cop Killer, Ronald Turney Williams. A Snohomish County sheriffs deputy expresses outrage that Ferguson once wrote a legal brief for the death-row inmate. A boy in a green shirt swings on a playset before disappearing into the words Keep Our Families Safe: Defeat Bob Ferguson. The national Republican State Leadership Committee spent $2.9 million on the commercial and two similar ads aimed at defeating Ferguson and promoting fellow Metropolitan King County Councilmember Reagan Dunn. Dunn is still on the council. Ferguson is the attorney general. While no public pollster has recently taken the pulse of Washington state on the death penalty, several local scholars and strategists said Fergusons victory is among multiple pieces of evidence that   Inslees decision is unlikely to haunt him in the future. The insiders also cited the experiences of other governors, including Oregons, and noted that while capital punishment is still popular, its support is declining. Thirty-two states have the death penalty, but six have abolished it in the past six years, giving legitimacy to foes of a policy long seen as unquestionably popular. The analysts mostly did not suggest Inslee would benefit from the moratorium, just that it wouldnt hurt him. I dont think itll have huge ramifications in his bid for re-election down the road, said Matt Barreto, a prominent University of Washington professor who runs the Washington Poll. Its just not a mobilizing issue. Republicans disagreed, arguing the moratorium could become a liability for Inslee. They provided internal polling showing the death penalty is popular in Washington. A 2011 poll commissioned by Dunns campaign from Moore Information, for example, showed 63 percent of state residents supported the death penalty while only 25 percent opposed it. The poll of 400 registered voters had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points. Some conservative lawmakers vowed last week to fight the moratorium. Some prosecutors criticized it. Some newspapers, including The Columbian in Vancouver, editorialized against Inslees decision, although others praised it. The Seattle Times editorial board on Sunday called for abolishing capital punishment., I think the governors action has already proven to be politically foolish, said Susan Hutchison, chairwoman of the Washington State Republican Party. Its executive overreach, and that is proving to be very unpopular among Americans in regard to President Obama. This is the same thing. Whether Republicans run ads on the issue if Inslee seeks re-election will depend on the candidate that runs in 2016, Hutchison said. Inslee spokesman David Postman said political considerations did not factor into the governors decision, which was announced at a news conference last Tuesday and surprised many in the Capitol. Inslee, a Democrat, had previously supported the death penalty, although he hadnt recently talked about it, or had been asked. In announcing he would not allow anybody to be executed while hes in office, but not commuting any death sentences or proposing any legislation, Inslee said he was taking a relatively restrained step. Still, Postman said, there was a recognition that there would be some people who would be unhappy with this decision. Issue emerged , The attacks in the Ferguson-Dunn race marked the first time in recent years that the death penalty emerged as a major political issue in Washington state. That may be because of the scant number of executions here  just five since 1963. Nine men are currently on death row. Dunn supporters chose the issue because Ferguson had helped Williams two decades previously, when Ferguson was a second-year law student working under a grant from the Arizona Capital Representation Project. During the campaign, Ferguson said he opposed the death penalty but that as attorney general would defend the states right to impose capital punishment. Dunn emphasized last week that he did not work with the Republican State Leadership Committee, a Karl Rove-funded group. But he said the ads were effective. It moved the ball forward, Dunn said. And it closed our poll numbers. Dunn did tighten his deficit in public polls after the ads ran, closing within 2 percentage points in two October 2012 surveys after trailing by 8 and 13 in them the month before. But he ultimately lost by 7 points, 46.5 percent to 53.5 percent  one of the larger losing margins among the high-profile statewide races that year. That result speaks for itself, said Ferguson, although he declined to comment on how the death penalty might play in other races. Officials with both of the 2012 gubernatorial campaigns, for Inslee and Republican Rob McKenna, said they did not consider the death penalty as a campaign issue or conduct any extensive polling on it. Sterling Clifford, who served as Inslees communications director, said the campaign didnt even discuss it., McKenna campaign manager Randy Pepple said he was focused on other issues, primarily education. The death penalty was not seen as a big issue to a ton of people, he said. I dont think this will be a top-tier issue in 2016, Pepple added. Comparison , Over the past few days, Inslees decision has been compared to former Illinois Republican Gov. George Ryans nationally watched moratorium in 2000. Ryan did not seek re-election, but probably not because of his death-penalty stance. Several of his former employees were indicted while he was in office, and he eventually was convicted of corruption. A Chicago Tribune poll conducted during the scandal showed Ryan had an approval rating of just 32 percent. But two-thirds of those surveyed supported the moratorium. A more relevant comparison may be found closer: In late 2011, Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber announced he would not allow any more executions while he was in office. Like Inslee, Kitzhaber called for a broad conversation. A state representative introduced a constitutional amendment to outlaw capital punishment. Then, said Salem Statesman Journal Editorial Page Editor Dick Hughes, nothing happened. The issue is just sitting there, he said, noting the amendment never got support in the Legislature. Kitzhaber is seeking re-election this year. But Hughes said the death penalty is a very minor issue. The much more major issue is that Cover Oregon, our health-care website, is a disaster, he said. Few governors have been hurt by suspending the death penalty, said Richard Dieter, executive director of anti-capital punishment Death Penalty Information Center. Dieter acknowledged an example of a politician being hit for being soft on crime  1988 Democratic Party presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, who lost to George H.W. Bush after facing an attack ad about William Willie Horton, who had raped a woman while on a furlough from jail. Dukakis had vetoed a bill to end the furloughs for first-degree murderers. But Dieter said others have gained support from opposing the death penalty, in part because voters respect a politician who takes a stand. People respect the position even if they disagree with it, Dieter said. Support falls , Nationwide, support for the death penalty has been falling since 1994, according to an annual poll by Gallup, Inc. Support was at 80 percent that year, according to the poll. Last year, it was at 60 percent  the lowest since 1972. Several local analysts said they didnt know of any local polling in Washington state. Stuart Elway, who runs the state Elway Poll, said he hasnt included the death penalty in his polls because it hasnt been a big issue. I think I will now, Elway said. Brian M.

{"Content": "[ OLYMPIA  Washington may be among the crowd of states moving up its presidential primary in 2016 as part of an effort to cut into the influence wielded by party caucuses. A proposal from Secretary of State Kim Wyman seeks to revamp the way Washingtons political parties pick their candidates for the nations highest office, moving the state away from a system in which party caucuses and conventions control how to award delegates after a nominal primary vote to one with stronger primaries. You have a much more representative outcome for a primary than for a caucus, Wyman said in a Tuesday morning news conference, citing figures that show 3 percent of state voters participate in caucuses versus more than 40 percent in primaries. Under the current process, created by a 1989 ballot initiative, voters choose a party candidate in a primary election, but the state political parties arent bound to use the results of that primary in allocating delegates to a candidate. The state pays for this straw-poll election, which Wymans office projects will cost $11.5 million in 2016, and the process is viewed as optional enough that lawmakers cancelled the 2012 primary to save money during a budget shortfall. Wymans plan, attached to pending bills in the state House and Senate, would move the states default primary date from late May to March 8, a week after the Super Tuesday primaries. It could move even earlier, Wyman said, depending on discussions with governors of a half-dozen other Western states to coordinate a primary date for maximum influence. The Republican and Democratic parties would each be asked to commit to allocating at least some delegates to the winner of its primary election. Even though Washington does not require voters to register with a party preference, voters would have to make a public declaration of party choice to vote in a partys presidential primary. If either party declines, all of the candidates would go onto one ballot with nonbinding results, and no public party declaration would be required to vote. Wymans idea has a strong chance for progress in the Legislature. Sponsors of the bills before the House and Senate include the chairs of the committees that will hear the bill first in each chamber. If it passes, the state Republican party plans to commit to awarding 50 percent or more of its delegates to the winner of its 2016 primary, state Republican chair Susan Hutchison said Tuesday, though the exact figure would be have to be calculated by the party rules committee. The primary is paid for by taxpayers, and so they want to know theres a purpose to it beyond being a beauty pageant, Hutchison said. The Washington state Democratic Party did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The plan comes up for a hearing before a Senate committee Thursday.]", "Date": "20150217", "Title": "[State considers revamping 2016 presidential primary]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/washington-considers-changing-2016-presidential-primary-2/", "Author": "[DERRICK NUNNALLY]"}
{"Content": "[ On a recent afternoon, Scott McKenzie watched torrential rains and a murky tide swallow the street outside his dog-grooming salon. Within minutes, much of this stretch of chic South Beach was flooded ankle-deep in a fetid mix of rain and sea. Welcome to the new Venice, McKenzie joked as salt water surged from the sewers. There are few places in the nation more vulnerable to rising sea levels than low-lying South Florida, a tourist and retirement mecca built on drained swampland. Yet as other coastal states and the Obama administration take aggressive measures to battle the effects of global warming, Floridas top Republican politicians are challenging the science and balking at government fixes. Among the chief skeptics are U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and former Gov. Jeb Bush, both possible presidential candidates in 2016. Gov. Rick Scott, who is running for re-election, has worked with the Republican-controlled Legislature to dismantle Floridas fledgling climate change initiatives. They were put into place by his predecessor and current opponent, Democrat Charlie Crist. Im not a scientist, Scott said, after a federal report pinpointed Florida  and Miami in particular  as among the countrys most at-risk areas. He and other Republicans warn against what they see as alarmist policies that could derail the countrys tenuous economic recovery. Their positions could affect their political fortunes. Democrats plan to place climate change, and the GOPs skepticism, front and center in a state where the issue is no longer an abstraction. Their hope is to win over independents and siphon some Republicans, who are deeply divided over global warming. Tom Steyer, a billionaire environmental activist, has pledged to spend $100 million this year to influence seven critical contests nationwide, including the Florida governors race. The battle in the countrys largest swing state offers a preview of what could be a pivotal fight in the next presidential election. Crist is running for his old job as a Democrat, criticizing Scott and Florida Republicans for reversing his efforts to curb global warming. They dont believe in science. Thats ridiculous, Crist said at a recent campaign rally in Miami. This is ground zero for climate change in America. Nationally, the issue could prove tricky for Democrats. Polls show a bipartisan majority of Americans favor measures to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gases, such as the new federal rule to limit carbon emissions from power plants. But they routinely rank climate change far behind the economy, the centerpiece of Scotts campaign, when prioritizing issues. In Miami Beach, which floods even on sunny days, the concern is palpable. On a recent afternoon, McKenzie pulled out his iPad and flipped through photos from a 2009 storm. In one, two women kayak through knee-high water in the center of town. This is not a future problem. Its a current problem, said Leonard Berry, director of the Florida Center for Environmental Studies at Florida Atlantic University and a contributing author of the National Climate Assessment, which found that sea levels have risen about 8 inches in the past century. Miami Beach is expected to spend $400 million on an elaborate pumping system to cope with routine flooding. To the north, Fort Lauderdale has shelled out millions to restore beaches and a section of coastal highway after Hurricane Sandy and other storms breached the citys concrete sea wall. Hallandale Beach, which lies on the Atlantic Coast between the two cities, has abandoned six of its eight drinking water wells because of encroaching seawater. By one regional assessment, the waters off South Florida could rise another 2 feet by 2060, a scenario that would overwhelm the regions aging drainage system and taint its sources of drinking water. Its getting to the point where some properties being bought today will probably not be able to be sold at the end of a 30-year mortgage, said Harold Wanless, chairman of the geological sciences department at University of Miami. You would think responsible leaders and responsible governments would take that as a wake-up call. Florida lacks a statewide approach to the effects of climate change, although just a few years ago, it was at the forefront on the issue. In 2007, Crist, then a Republican, declared global warming one of the most important issues that we will face this century, signed executive orders to tighten tailpipe-emission standards for cars and opposed coal-fired power plants. Bush, his predecessor, had pushed the state during his administration to diversify its energy mix and prioritize conservation. Even Rubio, who was then Florida House speaker and a vocal critic of Crists climate plans, supported incentives for renewable energy. With little opposition, the GOP-led Legislature passed a bill that laid the groundwork for a California-style cap-and-trade system to cut carbon emissions and created a special commission to study climate change. But the efforts sputtered as the economy collapsed and Crist and Rubio faced off in a divisive 2010 Republican primary for U.S. Senate. Although Rubio had voted for Crists landmark environmental measure, he soon hammered the governor for what he called a cap-and-trade scheme. Seeking support from the growing tea party movement, he distanced himself from the vote. Rubio also began to voice doubts about whether climate change is man-made, a doubt he shares with Bush. Both have stuck to that position. Amid meetings with conservative activists and Republican leaders in New Hampshire last month, Rubio said: I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it. Proposals to cut carbon emissions, he said, would do little to change current conditions but destroy our economy. Rubio later said he supports mitigation measures to protect coastal property from natural disasters. Scott and Florida Republicans share his current views. Denouncing job-killing legislation, they repealed Crists climate law, disbanded the states climate commission and eliminated a mandate requiring the state to use ethanol-blended gasoline. Asked about climate change recently, Scott demurred, saying the state has spent about $130 million on coastal flooding in his first term, as well as millions on environmental restoration. Meanwhile, Miami Beach is bracing for another season of punishing tides. Were suffering while everyone is arguing man-made or natural, said Christine Florez, president of the West Avenue Corridor Neighborhood Association. We should be working together to find solutions so people dont feel like theyve been left on a log drifting out to sea. ", "Date": "20140610", "Title": "[Seas rise, Fla.

{"Content": "[ On May 23, 2003, I attended the Baghdad news conference at which the U.S. viceroy, Paul Bremer, announced he was dissolving the Iraqi army. I thought of that day when I read of Wednesdays confrontation between 19-year-old student Ivy Dietrich and Jeb Bush, who had been blaming President Obama for the rise of the jihadis. She told the former Florida governor, Your brother created ISIS. Dietrichs claim was blunt but still right on the money. It should serve as a warning to 2016 presidential contenders: Using the Iraq war as a political club against the opposition can boomerang. Obama, too, has erred on Iraq, but the origins of ISIS go back to before he took office, and stem from mistakes made at the beginning of the war. Twelve years ago, Bremer axed tens of thousands of military officers with guns who were let go without pensions or severance. His order propelled the birth of an armed Sunni resistance among ex-Iraqi officers, which morphed into al-Qaeda in Iraq and now ISIS. Bremers decision reflected the Bush administrations lack of coherent planning about what to do after the U.S. invasion. Before the war, the U.S. military had recognized the danger of disbanding Iraqs armed forces, at a time of high unemployment and great social upheaval; it had planned to dissolve the units closest to Saddam Hussein, while vetting the rest and creating a smaller force to help rebuild the country. But Bremer changed the plan, apparently without consulting top U.S. military or State Department officials. After his announcement, I rushed to knock on doors in a Baghdad neighborhood populated by senior Sunni army brass, and heard the same message: We laid down our arms, as you asked in leaflets dropped from your planes, and this is how you reward us. We will fight you. I was reminded of that warning last month on a trip to Iraq, where U.S. military officers who have already served multiple tours in the country are trying, again, to rebuild the Iraqi army  so it can help drive ISIS out of Iraq. U.S. officers say there is a feeling of dj vu. The U.S. military worked hard to rebuild Iraqs security forces in the 2000s, but they collapsed during the ISIS invasion last summer. The Shiite-led government of the previous prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, had packed the corps with officials chosen on the basis of Shiite sect or bribes to political officials, including Shiite militiamen who lived and trained in Tehran. Professional military men were mostly kicked out under Maliki. The (current) Iraqi army was not formed on any real structure, and lacks a common understanding of leadership, said Raad al-Hamdani, a former general in Husseins army. This is an army without discipline or good morale. The recent capture of the key Iraqi city of Ramadi by the Islamic State, after Iraqi security forces fled, further underscores the accuracy of the generals words. Hamdani, a respected military professional cleared of any political crimes, now lives in Amman, Jordan. Thats because former Sunni army officers became targets for assassination by Shiite militias. Many of these officers have valuable expertise that would be helpful in defeating ISIS, but because they are Sunnis (and former Baath party members) few if any will be called on to help. Under such conditions, many ex-officers grew beards and morphed into jihadis in the last decade and became the backbone of al-Qaeda in Iraq. Others played key roles in ISIS, which helps explain why the organization has been fairly successful militarily. Bremers and George W. Bushs Iraq errors of omission and commission continue to resonate. None of this absolves Obama from responsibility for his role in ISISs emergence. Most glaring was the strong U.S. support for Maliki after he lost a close election in 2010. U.S. officials should have tried harder to help the winner, Iyad Allawi, form a government. As a secular Shiite, Allawi was far more skeptical of Iran and he might have allayed the Sunni resentments that helped fuel ISIS. But to blame the rise of ISIS only on Obama requires a blatant rewriting of history. The seeds of ISIS were planted when Bushs policies disempowered Sunnis and empowered Shiite religious parties and militias. Bush opened the door to massive Iranian influence in Iraq as the ayatollahs rushed to support fellow Shiites, which scared some Sunnis into supporting the jihadis. So, yes, Ivy Dietrich, a careless Iraq war sowed the seeds for ISIS, although Obamas lack of interest helped facilitate ISISs expansion. Instead of using the Iraq case as a political football, candidates of both parties would benefit from greater introspection. Its time for more serious thinking about how to help clean up the mess that America helped create in Iraq.]", "Date": "20150518", "Title": "[Blame for Islamic State rise shared by two presidents]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/blame-for-islamic-state-rise-shared-by-two-presidents/", "Author": "[NULL]"}
{"Content": "[ On the steps of the Insurance Building on the state Capitol campus,     Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler pauses to ponder        a question about his motivations. I love predictability, Kreidler     says  at first glance, an odd statement, from a man now at the center     of health insurances biggest upheaval in decades. With his moves     watched by policymakers, insurance regulators and companies        across the country, this affable 70-year-old politician has had     anything but a predictable life in the past few years.   ,     Consumer advocates say he may be        the most respected insurance regulator in the country, but     some state legislators tried to have his office abolished in the     last session.  Now, midway through his third term in his position,    Kreidler is taking full advantage of his independence  only 11     states elect insurance commissioners  to wade into some of the most     challenging issues of his long career.       , Earlier this year, he adopted    new rules    to address narrow        networks of doctors and hospitals included in health plans, spurring    vigorous protests from health providers, insurers and businesses. He     decided that many low-cost association coverage plans, favored by     small businesses in Washington, were illegal under the Affordable     Care Act (ACA). That drew    sharp criticism from the business community. And when Kreidler, a     lifelong Democrat, quickly    dismissed    President Obamas offer last year to let people temporarily keep their     discontinued health plans, many policyholders reacted in anger.  ,     To some, it seems unlikely that Kreidler, a doting     grandfather who eats the same lunch nearly every day  with a     generous dollop of Tabasco sauce         would find himself the target of so much animus. Observers say he is     usually slow to anger or to take a political joust personally. He is     a politician, not a wonk, but talks easily about risk pools and     underwriting, and admits to a certain pride when praised by an     actuary. Occasionally, he refers to himself in the third person, as     in:        No one is more identified with health reform at the state level     than Mike Kreidler.   , In the hot seat,     What he means is that hes become a target. In the past legislative     session, vexed by what she considered Kreidlers intransigence,     Republican State Sen. Randi Becker of Eatonville sponsored a bill to     replace his elected position with a board selected by legislative     caucuses. Becker said her bill, which failed, would have     made the office more accountable.    , John Conniff, a lawyer and former deputy insurance commissioner   who now represents businesses, says Kreidlers decisions are too     often rigid and ideological, and ignore        the real costs to people running small companies.       ,     In the latest storm,     the insurance offices chief administrative-law judge    accused    Kreidlers chief deputy of trying to pressure       her     to decide cases Kreidlers way  or lose her job. A leaked copy of the     judges complaint halted an ongoing high-profile case and, later,     she said she had accidentally  and improperly  sent it to a lawyer in the case.       ,     Kreidlers decision to    suspend    the judge  but not his chief deputy  brought criticism from        friends and foes, despite his vow to hold        an independent investigation of her    allegations.    , Mike Padden, a Spokane Valley Republican and former district-court     judge, said the allegations suggest really improper conduct may have occurred.      He has scheduled a    legislative   work session focusing on the independence of administrative-law     judges and may propose legislation, he said last week.     Kreidler appears sanguine. All painful episodes seem like the     worst ever when they happen,        he said, but they blow over. Ill probably be proven wrong, but I     think its kind of a sideshow right now, he said.    ,     Kreidler said hes focused instead on the big picture, where the     issues are crucial: long-term market stability, the ability of     consumers to get the care they pay for, and preserving the offices     role as a guide  and rule maker  through the        ACA. I have good reasons why Im doing what Im doing, he said. In the     end, I think we will have a better system as a result of my being     strong.   , Path to his dream job,     Myron Bradford Mike Kreidler, son of two Tacoma-area teachers and     grandson of the former dean of women at Pacific Lutheran University,     was born in 1943, a fraternal twin who beat brother Peter by 13     minutes. His sense of leadership was bolstered by his parents     decision to hold the boys back a year; their birthday was just on     the dividing line for entering school. It was a great decision,     said Peter Kreidler. We were more mature in terms of athletics,     self confidence, our ability to talk to other people. They wore the     same clothes all the way through Curtis High School in Tacoma, where     Mike was elected student-body president. A high-school civics-class     debate ignited a driving interest in health reform.  While in college in Oregon, Kreidler married Lela Lopez, of        Forest Grove, Ore. and received        a doctorate in optometry. After       two years active duty with the Army Reserve, he received a masters     in public health.   ,     In 1972, he began two decades as an optometrist     with Group Health Cooperative. But he couldnt resist the lure of     political opportunity when it came knocking  literally. At his door     was a        Democratic Party worker, ginning up turnout for a precinct meeting.     He asked Mike if hed serve as precinct chairman. That got him     going, Peter Kreidler recalled. Soon, still working as an optometrist,     Kreidler won        a seat on the North Thurston School Board in 1973. After that, his political career included the state Legislature for 16 years, Congress for a single term and stints in regional and federal agencies. Much of that time he continued to practice optometry on a flexible schedule.  At home, tragedy struck when a baby boy born with a severe birth defect lived only three months. A year later, the Kreidlers adopted a son, now their middle child. In 2000, Kreidler was elected insurance commissioner  the job of his dreams. He succeeded Deborah Senn, inheriting an individual health-insurance market in disarray.  For the next decade, Kreidlers favorite watchwords were consistency, stability, fairness and, yes, predictability. He regained accreditation for the office and successfully pushed for consumer legislation. Health insurance, always a small part of what the office handled, wasnt often big news, and disputes were mostly about humdrum matters, Kreidler said. Rep. Eileen Cody, a West Seattle Democrat who chairs the House Healthcare & Wellness Committee, said Kreidler has been good for both consumers and insurers. He has a reputation for being fair, Cody said. The insurance industry has not bitched to me about him like they did about Deborah [Senn]. Office overwhelmed, The advent of the ACA suddenly nudged   Kreidler into the spotlight. Insurers pushed for narrow networks, consumers pushed for more access, and every type of provider pushed to be included, noted Cody.  All the little pigs come to the trough, she quipped. Hes in somewhat of a horrible position. Last year, by all accounts, started badly. A dust-up over a gift resulted in the exodus of two employees in Kreidlers office, including his chief deputy, Mike Watson. Kreidler said the dispute arose when Kreidler argued that ethics rules allowed him to keep a potted plant sent by a trade association.  Watson, a friend and campaign manager for four decades, wouldnt talk about the details. I will tell you, I said for many years that I was one bad day away from retiring. I had a bad day, and I retired, he said. They remain friends, both said, and Watson still serves as Kreidlers campaign treasurer. Meanwhile, other employees, including most of his deputies, began peeling away from the agency for different, individual reasons. In April of last year, Kreidler had extensive open-heart surgery, just as the crazy first year of the ACA hit. Suddenly, it was a new, more intensely competitive game. His office, which reviews insurance plans, was prepared for insurers trying to skirt the law banning discrimination on health conditions  for example, by excluding certain drugs from coverage. But it wasnt prepared to see such narrow provider networks, he said. We were truly overwhelmed, Kreidler said. Soon, it became clear that the informal desk-drawer rules his office had used in the past wouldnt stand up; it needed formal rules. Much of what we had been doing was really bluster, Kreidler said. We didnt really have that kind of authority. An episode that caused a rift began last year, when Kreidler refused to approve several plans aimed for sale under the Washington Healthplanfinder insurance marketplace. The board of the Washington Health Benefit Exchange, which operates Healthplanfinder, sent the issue back, saying, essentially, make it work. He needed new, formal rules to protect consumers in the new world, Kreidler said, and he had the authority to do just that. Seeking transparency,  Kreidler says he doesnt expect the next few years to ease up. Soon, hell begin revising the network rules for 2016 plans. He grows animated about his plan to create transparency to let purchasers see whether a plan includes the drugs or doctors they need. What critics characterize as Kreidlers unwillingness to compromise, others see as strength of conviction. Hes very intense, says his wife Lela. When he gets onto something, it really means a lot to him to see things through. Other insurance regulators are watching closely as Kreidler walks the tightrope, says Sally McCarty, a former Indiana insurance commissioner, now with Georgetown Universitys Center on Health Insurance Reforms. Theyre all looking at what Washington is doing, she says, and particularly at Kreidlers effort to update network-adequacy standards, because Washington is first out of the gate. Kreidler is eager to take it on. I cant imagine anything better than being at the center of health reform. This is something this country has desperately needed for 100 years, he says. It couldnt be a better job. Carol M. Ostrom: 206-464-2249 or costrom@seattletimes.com.

{"Content": "[ ONAWA, Iowa (AP)  Scott Walkers suggestion that building a wall between Canada and the U.S. might be a legitimate idea prompted swift derision from fellow Republicans on Monday and an attempt by his campaign to clarify what he meant. It was the latest misstep for a 2016 presidential candidate who got off to a strong start but has fallen back into the pack after a series of fumbles and a lackluster performance in the first GOP debate. The Wisconsin governor was asked on NBCs Meet the Press on Sunday whether he thought a wall should be built along the more than 5,000 miles of border with Canada. Some people have asked us about that in New Hampshire, he said. They raised some very legitimate concerns, including some law enforcement folks that brought that up to me at one of our town hall meetings about a week and a half ago. So that is a legitimate issue for us to look at. Walkers campaign spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said Monday his comments were being misunderstood. Despite the attempts of some to put words in his mouth, Gov. Walker wasnt advocating for a wall along our northern border, Strong said. She said he meant that border security was a legitimate issue. But the fact he appeared to entertain the notion of a northern wall brought a swift response. Thats a pretty dumb idea, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a 2016 rival, told Boston Herald Radio. There have been a lot of dumb ideas put out. One, that the Mexicans will pay for a wall, was probably the dumbest of dumb ideas. But putting a wall up between us and Canada is sort of a ridiculous notion. Donald Trump has proposed pressure tactics to persuade Mexico to pay for a wall along its border with the U.S. Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist who leads the Right to Rise political action committee supporting Jeb Bush, said on Twitter that Walker was distracted by his plan to build a wall along the Canadian border. Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy from the border state of Vermont piled on, too. Terrible idea, he said. Election season always brings out crazy ideas, but this is one of the craziest. The latest struggle for Walker comes after hes had to backtrack and clarify his positions on immigration and terrorism, reassure jittery donors after his performance in the first GOP debate and reshape his campaign to try to rekindle the spark he showed months ago, when he quickly climbed into the top tier of candidates after impressing Iowans in a January appearance. Thats meant trying to get back to basics in Iowa, where hes aiming to visit all 99 counties. A lot changes between now and the caucuses, he said last week after a two-day tour. I think the most important thing we can do is get out and tell our story. In his latest swing, he pitched himself as the only Republican who has fought and won without compromising his core conservative principles. He also outlined his foreign policy goals, criticized President Barack Obama and Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton as leading from behind and called for a state visit with the Chinese president to be canceled. Yet in the past 10 days, Walker also changed his stance three times on whether he, like Trump, favored doing away with the constitutional right to citizenship granted to people born in the U.S. Walker finally said he had no position on the issue and would not seek repeal of the 14th Amendment that provides that right. In New Hampshire, Walker also said recently there were only a handful of moderate followers of Islam  a religion followed by more than a billion people worldwide. His campaign issued a statement saying Walker knows that most Muslims want to live in peace. The super PAC backing Walker plans to start broadcasting television ads in Iowa after Labor Day.

{"Content": "[ OSHKOSH, Wis. (AP)  Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, one week after launching his bid for the 2016 presidential nomination, signed a bill Monday that outlaws non-emergency abortions at or beyond 20 weeks of pregnancy. Abortion is a core issue for the conservative Republican base whose support Walker will seek as he tries to stand out in a crowded presidential field that also includes former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and billionaire Donald Trump. While Walker has a long history of opposing abortions, its an issue where he could be targeted by rivals: Just nine months ago he ran a television ad during his gubernatorial re-election campaign where he expressed support for a bill that would leave abortion decisions between a woman and her doctor. Walkers record includes defunding Planned Parenthood; requiring abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, a law currently blocked by a federal court judge; and requiring women to have ultrasounds and be shown images of the fetus before having an abortion. Walker last year, during his re-election campaign, refused to say last year whether he would support a 20-week abortion ban. But in the face of questions from anti-abortion conservatives over his commitment to the issue in the light of the campaign ad, Walker in March came out in support of the 20-week abortion ban. The truth is that Scott Walker lied to Wisconsin voters when he was elected governor after saying that abortion is between a woman and her doctor, said Sasha Bruce with NARAL Pro-Choice America, a leading abortion rights advocacy group. Now, in an effort to win the votes of the extreme base of the Republican Party, Walker has traded the health and well-being of women and families to score cheap political points. The governors signature makes Wisconsin the 15th state to pass similar bans. There is no exception for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. The new law  which cleared the Legislature without any Democratic support  is expected to be challenged in court. Walker, speaking with reporters after the bill signing, said he was confident it would survive any legal challenge, calling the five-month ban a reasonable standard. For people, regardless of where they might stand, when an unborn child can feel pain I think most people feel its appropriate to protect that child, Walker said. But Kaylie Hanson, speaking for the Democratic National Committee, said the new law was nothing more than a timely favor for the Republican base days after Walker joined the presidential race. The harsh reality is that this law will hurt women, as it puts up barriers to care for rape and incest survivors  no exceptions  and threatens the health of the mother, Hanson said in a statement. This law doesnt only undermine the most basic womens health services. Its radical, dangerous, and lacks respect for half the population of Wisconsin. Bans on abortion after 20 weeks are popular, at least on the surface. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in November of 2014 found that 6 in 10 Americans support banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, except in cases of rape or incest. On the other hand, a 2012 CNN/ORC poll found the vast majority of Americans  more than 8 in 10  said abortion should be legal in cases of rape or incest. An Associated Press-GfK poll conducted in January and February found that 51 percent of Americans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 45 percent think it should be illegal in most or all cases. Under the new Wisconsin law, doctors who perform an abortion at or after 20 weeks in non-emergency situations could be charged with a felony punishable by up to $10,000 in fines and 3 years in prison. Doctors could also be sued for damages. Doctors would be allowed to perform abortions beyond 20 weeks only if the mother is likely to die or suffer irreversible injuries within 24 hours. The laws supporters say fetuses can feel pain after 20 weeks. They say the ban will spare those unborn children an excruciatingly painful death. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, however, says fetuses cant feel pain until the third trimester starts at 27 weeks. Minority Democrats have complained that Republicans should leave women alone and let them decide how to handle their own bodies. Abortions after 20 weeks are rare in Wisconsin. According to the most recent state Department of Health Services information, 89 of nearly 6,500 abortions performed in Wisconsin in 2013, or roughly 1 percent, occurred after the 20-week mark. The U.S. Supreme Courts 1973 Roe v. Wade decision established a nationwide right to abortion but allowed states to restrict the procedures after the fetus reaches viability, the point where it could survive outside the womb. The ruling offered no legal definition of viability but said it could range from the 24th to 28th week of pregnancy. Courts have blocked bans in Georgia, Idaho and Arizona. Litigation in other states is ongoing. A federal appellate court in May struck down Arkansas ban on abortions after the 12th week of pregnancy if a doctor can detect a fetal heartbeat, finding that prohibition unconstitutionally burdens women.

{"Content": "[ Our presidents are good at praising Americas magnificent national park system, but theyre lousy at maintaining it. Bill Clinton-the-candidate, for example, spoke of how lucky he was to have Hot Springs National Park as a childhood playground. Yet Clinton-the-president sat idle as that parks natural wonders and facilities deteriorated  and as the National Park Services maintenance backlog soared to $5 billion. Likewise, in his 2000 campaign, a khaki-clad George W. Bush posed in the majestic Cascade Range. He wailed that parks were at the breaking point and vowed to eliminate Clintons backlog. Instead, he slashed the Park Service budget (including a 40 percent cut in needed repair funds for the Cascade parklands hed used as a political prop). The maintenance backlog ballooned to nearly $9 billion under his presidency. Ranger George did make one fix, however  a PR fix. Bush operatives instructed park superintendents to make budget cuts in areas that wont cause public or political controversy. When discussing park deterioration, they were to avoid the phrase budget cutbacks and say instead that parks were undergoing service level adjustments. Under President Obama, who speaks movingly of a childhood Greyhound bus trip with his family to see some of our parks, another 12 percent has been chopped from the Park Service budget  bumping the deferred-maintenance bill to a staggering $11.5 billion. To his credit, Obama has proposed a 2016 Centennial Budget for the Park Service, mitigating years of destructive underfunding and calling for $1 billion to address the backlog. Good for him. But that still leaves a $10 billion shortfall, and the sour duo of Sen. Mitch McConnell and Speaker John Boehner will oppose even that increase for the maintenance of these invaluable public assets. Hidebound by their twisted corporate ideology, they dismiss public parks as government intrusion into the private realms of Disneyland and SeaWorld. So, while we Americans celebrate the 100th anniversary of our National Park Service, Washington, D.C. is literally stripping service out of the National Park Service. And, by refusing to fund essential upkeep year after year, Americas so-called leaders are guaranteeing that this invaluable national asset  deemed Americas best idea by novelist and historian Wallace Stegner  will fall into acute disrepair. The only solution, they say, is to commercialize, industrialize and privatize our parks, converting these jewels of the common good into just another corporate cash cow. The corporatization process started with co-branding agreements, rationalized by Park Service officials as aligning the economic and historical legacies of parks with advertisers. In other words, theyre selling the Park Services proud public brand  as well as its soul. First in line was Coca-Cola. In 2007, the multibillion-dollar colossus became a proud partner with the Park Service by donating a mere $2.5 million (tax-deductible, meaning we taxpayers subsidized the deal) to the Park Service fundraising arm. In return, not only did Coke get exclusive rights to use park logos in its ads, but it was allowed to veto a Park Service plan to ban sales of bottled water in the Grand Canyon National Park. Disposable plastic bottles are that parks biggest source of trash, but Coke owns Dasani, the top-selling water, so bye-bye ban. Public outrage forced officials to reverse this crass move, but the Park Services integrity has yet to recover. Then this April, the Park Service abandoned its longstanding policy of disallowing any links to alcohol or tobacco products when it entered a partnership with Anheuser-Busch after the company donated a $2.5 million tax-deductible gift. In turn, its Budweiser brand was given the Statue of Liberty. Not literally, but symbolically  Bud now has the right to plaster Lady Liberty, the iconic symbol of the United States, on its cans. Never mind that Anheuser-Busch is now Belgian-owned. The real hypocrisy is the claim that such co-branding is a philanthropic service to the commons. Creeping commercialization of our public parks no longer creeps; its running rampant, with brands such as Disney, L.L. Bean and Subaru buying their pieces of Park Service integrity. And get a whiff of this: Air Wick has also paid to become a Park Service partner, so its now marketing a new fragrance collection thats advertised as being uniquely inspired by Americas national parks.]", "Date": "20150731", "Title": "[Sold: National parks go to the highest corporate bidder]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/sold-national-parks-go-to-the-highest-corporate-bidder/", "Author": "[Jim Hightower]"}
{"Content": "[ OXON HILL, Md.  Scott Walker has momentum with conservatives. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul have the passion. And Jeb Bush still faces widespread skepticism thats not going away. Those were some of the conclusions as thousands of conservatives ended a three-day conference Saturday with fresh takes on potential candidates for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, impressions that will help shape the early stages of the wide-open race. Thirteen potential candidates each got 20 minutes before the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). Walker, the Wisconsin governor, got the loudest applause, with Paul, a U.S. senator from Kentucky, and Cruz, a senator from Texas, close behind. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson was the grass-roots champion, as his T-shirted army seemed to be everywhere. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal stoked considerable curiosity with his detailed prescription for derailing the Common Core educational standards. And former business executive Carly Fiorina got buzz for her lively zingers aimed at likely Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton. None emerged as the clear rising star. Walker came closest. Hes stoked interest because hes a new face, a 47-year-old just-re-elected governor from a nominally Democratic state who took on labor unions and won. In one sign of his potential appeal, Walker came in a strong second in a straw poll of activists at the conference. Pollsters said just over 3,000 CPAC attendees voted, and nearly half identified as between the ages of 18 and 25. Respondents said economic issues, such as jobs and taxes, were most important to them in deciding whom to support as the Republican nominee for president in 2016. Paul, with 26 percent, won it for the third year in a row, followed closely by newcomer Walker, with 21 percent; then Cruz, with 11.5 percent; Carson, with 11.4 percent, and Bush, with 8.3 percent. His appearance at the meeting was tarnished a bit, though, when he appeared to liken union protesters in Wisconsin to terrorists. If I can take on 100,000 protesters, he said, I can do the same across the world. Walker nonetheless remained an attractive option to a bloc of activists frustrated that the past two Republican presidential nominees, John McCain and Mitt Romney, werent conservative enough and seemed too tied to the mainstream political establishment. Barbara Decker, a San Diego retiree, liked Walker and Cruz, explaining: Im tired of establishment figures. That was Bushs burden, and will be for some time. Hes not only the candidate piling up big-donor money and tapping a network of well-known insiders, hes also the son and brother of presidents. That bothered a lot of people at the conference. Im not a fan of imperial presidencies, said Travis Murray, a Coast Guard officer from Shorewood, Ill. The Founding Fathers never intended to have a hierarchy handing down the presidency to future generations. The Bush name also remains a source of conservative wariness. Theres a lot of Bush fatigue, said David Keene, former American Conservative Union chairman, and neither his brother or father was seen by many conservatives as conservative enough. They disliked President George H.W. Bush for agreeing to a tax increase after pledging no new taxes. They criticized President George W. Bush for presiding over huge federal deficits in his second term. Jeb Bushs supporters said he did what he needed to do at this conference. He flooded the convention hall with supporters when he spoke Friday, making sure cheers drowned out booing for his immigration and education rsum. Those issues will continue to dog Bush. He maintained that the Common Core educational standards, which he supports, do not constitute a federal overreach into a local function, a view not widely shared at the meeting. While the standards were developed by governors and education officials, the Obama administration has tied some federal funding to acceptance of the standards. Bush also repeated his support for a path to legalization for many immigrants in this country illegally. To supporters, thats the kind of stance that will help him if hes the nominee and needs to attract a wider audience. He explained himself very well, said Ed Cowling, a Phoenix public-relations executive. The crowd really seemed to quiet down as he spoke. Not in the halls. No, a thousand times no, said Nedra Babcock, a Tulsa prison-reform advocate, of Bush. Why not? Common Core. The next test for these potential candidates will be pulling away from the pack. Some made progress. It was hard to walk down a hall without someone trying to slap a Run Ben Run sticker somewhere or offer a Stand with Rand button. Walker got positive comments everywhere, notably for fighting the unions. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida got some mention for his explanations of his views, notably how hes learned a lesson from his initial stand on immigration, which was protested by conservatives. Others were all but forgotten in the Saturday hall chatter. Few were talking about potentials such as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry or Donald Trump. Most will appear again next Saturday at the Iowa Ag Forum, where theyll address rural issues. Theyre also quietly competing in the money primary. Bush is expected to be the leader in fundraising. The true gauge of whos up and down will be more subtle and difficult to measure. Activists headed home Saturday with new thoughts and feelings about these candidates, ready to share them with like-minded friends and associates. Impressions forged here will matter, and thats why Walker emerged with a slight edge. He seems real, Babcock said.]", "Date": "20150228", "Title": "[Wisconsins Gov.

{"Content": "[ OXON HILL, Md. (AP)  Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said Thursday that his experience taking on thousands of protesters in his state helped prepare him to take on terrorists across the world. The likely Republican presidential contender sparked pointed criticism from labor union leaders across the country after remarks delivered on the first day of the Conservative Political Action Conference in suburban Washington. The annual conference features more than a dozen potential Republican presidential contenders over three days hoping to win over conservative activists. Asked how he would handle the Islamic State group if elected president, Walker said, For years Ive been concerned about that threat, not just abroad but here on American soil. If I can take on 100,000 protesters, I can do the same across the world, he said. Walker is gearing up for a 2016 presidential contest in which foreign policy figures to play prominently. What determines the perfect candidate for 2016?, GOPs Jeb Bush working to reassert conservative credentials, Christie tells CPAC crowd he shouldnt be counted out, Carly Fiorina ramps up Hillary Clinton attacks at CPAC, Islamic State militants have captured large parts of Iraq and neighboring Syria over the last year. They declared a self-styled caliphate on territories that are under their control, killing members of religious minorities, driving others from their homes, enslaving women and destroying houses of worship. Walkers comments drew sharp reaction from union leaders. Its disgusting that Gov. Walker would compare everyday heroes  educators  to international terrorists, said Betsy Kippers, a teacher and president of the Wisconsin Education Association Council. Gov. Walker, I know terrorism. I know that your own states citizens speaking up for whats right isnt terrorism, said Jim Tucciarelli, a union representative in New York City whose office was one block away from the 9/11 attacks. Today, after hearing your words, I also know the sound of cowardice. Walker has limited experience with foreign policy. He recently returned from a trip to England. The Wisconsin governor has faced particularly aggressive protests from labor unions over his budget policies in the four years since he took office. He survived a recall election in 2010 and a bitter re-election test last fall. Walker spokesman Kirsten Kukowski sought to clarify his remarks after the speech. Gov. Walker believes our fight against ISIS is one of the most important issues our country faces. He was in no way comparing any American citizen to ISIS, Kukowski said, using one acronym for the Islamic State group. What the governor was saying was: When faced with adversity he chooses strength and leadership. Walker dedicated much of his remarks Thursday to the threat of radical Islam. He said he receives regular threat assessments from the FBI and the leader of Wisconsins National Guard. We need a president, a leader, who will stand up and say we will take the fight to them and not wait til they bring the fight to American soil, he said. We need to show the world that in America you have no better ally and no greater enemy. Walker was briefly interrupted during his remarks with a Run Scott Run chant.

{"Content": "[ PHOENIX (AP)  Sen. John McCain announced Tuesday that he will run for re-election in 2016, making official a move that has been widely expected for the Republican as he looks to extend his nearly three-decade career in the Senate. McCain described his plans to run before an Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry luncheon in Phoenix, receiving a loud applause when he told the crowd: With a full heart, I ask Arizonans again for their support as I seek re-election to the United States Senate. Im as determined as ever to deserve your trust and grateful as ever for the privilege. His appearance before a pro-business crowd put him in friendly territory ahead of a race in which he will likely face a challenge from the right amid tea party dissatisfaction over his record in the Senate. McCain will be 80 by Election Day, but says he is in great shape and has much work to do in the Senate. I work 16-hour days. Look at what Ive done for Arizona and America, he told The Associated Press. Make your own judgment. McCain is a former prisoner of war during the Vietnam War who was first elected to the Senate in 1986, replacing longtime conservative stalwart Barry Goldwater. He ran for president in 2000 and secured the Republican Partys nomination in 2008, losing to Barack Obama. He coasted to re-election to the Senate in 2010 and has signaled on several occasions in recent months that he was planning to seek a sixth term. McCain said he will emphasize local issues during his campaign, such as the drought, his work to benefit a copper mine and legislation to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs. The VA was thrown into turmoil last year amid allegations of misconduct and cover-ups at the VA hospital in Phoenix. The most prominent Republican to hint of challenging McCain is state Sen. Kelli Ward, a conservative member of the Arizona Legislature. Ward said she is still testing the waters but knows shell have to raise between $5 million and $10 million to beat McCain, who already has more than $3.5 million in cash on hand and the ability to raise much more. Being able to raise money is going to be very important. I think thats very important in a David and Goliath situation, Ward said. The state Republican partys leaders, dominated by conservatives, censured McCain last year for not being sufficiently conservative, but hes brushed off the criticism. A spokeswoman for the Arizona Democratic Party called McCain an angry man who pontificates on pretty much anything. McCains not going to do anything to help working families in Arizona, party spokeswoman Barbara Lubin said. He lives for the media interviews. He certainly is not a statesman, and I think that hes just publicly differing with the president just to get himself press. Thats all he lives for these days. Glenn Hamer, president of the Arizona Chamber, said McCain never takes anything for granted in a political race and has a deep reservoir of support in Arizona. That combined with his national security credentials should easily overcome any primary challenge in 2016, Hamer said. I would expect that he would be overwhelmingly re-elected, he said. McCain was elevated to chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee this year after his party reclaimed the Senate. He has repeatedly used his prominence on the committee to attack Obama on foreign policy, ridiculing what he called a feckless policy of leading from behind.]", "Date": "20150407", "Title": "[US Sen.

{"Content": "[ Plans for building Seattles waterfront seawall  overwhelmingly approved by voters last week  call for seven years of construction, with a shutdown from Memorial Day through Labor Day each year to protect the peak summer tourist season for visitors and waterfront businesses. Alaskan Ways four lanes will narrow to two, pedestrian access could be blocked as the work progresses along the waterfront, and the area will be noisy and dusty as the city undertakes what leaders say is the most intensive and complex such project in its history. Knowing that, some business owners are complaining that a three-month construction shutdown isnt adequate. They want work on the seawall to be stopped through September, which they say is just as busy as June. And they say the city has told them over the past few years that a four-month shutdown would be honored as work on the Elliott Bay seawall gets under way next fall. Waterfront businesses are livid, said Bob Donegan, president of Ivars, whose flagship restaurant is at Pier 54 on the downtown waterfront. The weather is still good in September, the cruise ships are still sailing. The Mariners, the Huskies, Sounders and Seahawks are all playing. Its a busy month for us, Donegan said. He said that based on data from the past two years, waterfront businesses do about 54 percent of their annual sales between June and September, with some doing as much as 80 percent in that period. City officials say theyre trying to balance the costs to the public of extending the construction project beyond the scheduled seven years with maintaining a vibrant and viable waterfront economy. The city has a tight timeline for completing the seawall. Phase One, from South Washington Street to Virginia Street, must be finished by 2016, in time for the planned removal of the viaduct and the replacement of Alaskan Way. A tunnel will replace the viaduct. We have significant deadlines that are really not flexible, said City Councilmember Tom Rasmussen, chairman of the Transportation Committee. Were trying to strike a balance between meeting the needs of businesses and getting the project done. In addition to the summer construction stoppage, the city also faces state and federal restrictions to protect migrating salmon. Work cant be done in the water between Feb. 15 and Aug. 1. We have seven species that are threatened or endangered. Were already facing limitations about when we can schedule work, said Jennifer Wieland, seawall project manager for the Seattle Department of Transportation. Wieland said the city is willing to talk with waterfront businesses about extending the summer shutdown for another month, but is currently committed only to June through August. Kevin Clark, president and CEO of Argosy Cruises, said September and October account for 20 percent of his companys annual income and that Argosy loses money January through April, when few people want to be on the water. Weve been emphatic that the city needs to push the work out until after September. Their assumption is that after Labor Day, the waterfront goes dark, Clark said. Voters approved a $290 million, 30-year bond measure to rebuild the seawall in the Nov. 6 general election with 77 percent of the vote. The city Tuesday released the Draft Environmental Impact Statement on the entire seawall project. Waterfront businesses were briefed on the draft last week. The draft environmental review specifies a shutdown from Memorial Day through Labor Day and notes that disruptions to transportation and business during construction will be substantial. Wieland said mitigation measures will be detailed in the final report in March. Donegan, of Ivars, said the city doesnt have flexibility in scheduling now because of delays in planning the project over the past few years. He said the city changed design contractors, changed city staff on the project and chose to pursue funding from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, rather than going forward with what the city could finance itself. They want the biggest supporters of the project to now pay for their delays. Thats not what they promised us. Thats not what we agreed to, Donegan said. The city says it has worked steadily on planning the project since 2010, when Mayor Mike McGinn identified the seawall as a critical piece of infrastructure that wasnt built to modern seismic standards and needed replacing. Preliminary design work wasnt completed until March. Until then, Wieland said, the City Council believed it didnt have enough certainty about the project and design costs to place a bond measure before voters. The suggestion that changing design teams and working with the Army Corps has led to years of schedule delays is not accurate, she said. The city is still hoping for federal funding for Phase 2 of the project, which will extend north to Broad Street. City Council President Sally Clark said the citys goal is to complete the seawall as quickly as possible without damaging either salmon or waterfront businesses. Maybe we can trade June for September, but can we talk about extending the length of time were down there without increasing the costs? I dont think its possible to do this project without impacts, she said. Lynn Thompson: 206-464-8305 or lthompson@seattletimes.com.

Even as Bryants campaign went live, the Polar Pioneer, the first of those oil rigs, arrived in Elliott Bay on Thursday afternoon, greeted by protesters in kayaks. Despite approval by the Obama administration of the Arctic drilling, environmentalists argue Seattle should not be complicit in oil extraction that will worsen global climate change. They have hotly opposed the ports Terminal lease with Foss Maritime, Shells contractor. Bryant avoided the controversy in his announcement video, which featured him standing in a green field in Lewis County. Over soothing music and scenes of pristine landscapes, Bryant recalled growing up near Hood Canal, and said it is on my bucket list to make sure that when I go, Puget Sound is healthier than when I was born. But Bryants support of the Shell deal has angered environmental groups, including Washington Conservation Voters (WCV), which endorsed his 2011 re-election campaign. Shannon Murphy, WCVs president, slammed the ironic timing of Bryants announcement, and mocked his talk of caring for Puget Sound. His actions today show thats just rhetoric for him, she said. WCV is a major ally of the Democratic Party and spent heavily to elect Inslee in 2012. Alex Hays, a spokesman for the Bryant campaign, called the Shell fight entirely symbolic and defended the ports environmental record. We reject this false choice between the environment and jobs, he said. A port commissioner since 2008, Bryant is also chairman of Bryant Christie, a firm he founded in 1992 that helps companies market and sell products overseas. On his website, he boasted of working to cut port carbon emissions and on the recently announced alliance between the ports of Seattle and Tacoma. Bryant, 54, who lives in Seattle, did not make himself available for interviews Thursday. He has been mulling a bid for higher office for years and has been traveling the state extensively to raise his profile. More than two dozen state House Republican lawmakers signed a letter this week urging Bryant to run. The letter criticized Inslee for a hyperpartisan, divisive style and said Bryant would bring unifying, pragmatic leadership to the state capitol. As a relatively obscure elected official, Bryants first obstacle will be introducing himself to potential supporters. Hes positioning himself as a political moderate, citing former President Theodore Roosevelt, famously a conservationist, as his hero. In a statement, Jamal Raad, spokesman for the state Democratic Party, criticized Bryants past donations to deeply conservative Republicans including former President George W. Bush. Working Washington, a labor-backed group, also hit Bryant for opposing its efforts to raise pay for workers at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Other Republicans are likely to join the 2016 fray in the coming months. GOP insiders have pointed to state Sens. Andy Hill, R-Redmond, and Steve Litzow, R-Mercer Island, as potential contenders, along with Republican Congressman Dave Reichert. Along with Bryant, those potential rivals are scheduled to speak this weekend at the annual conference of the Mainstream Republicans of Washington in Leavenworth, Chelan County. But the path to winning back the governors mansion will be tough for any Republican. With populous King County growing into a solidly Democratic stronghold, the GOP has lost eight straight gubernatorial races going back to 1984  the longest such losing streak in the nation for the party. Bryants announcement downplayed his Republican affiliation, which was listed only as small-type R at the bottom of his campaign website. In his video, he said the campaign shouldnt be about Republicans versus Democrats. My agenda isnt ideological. Its not partisan, Bryant said.]", "Date": "20150514", "Title": "[Port Commissioner Bill Bryant announces run for governor]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/port-commissioner-bill-bryant-announces-run-for-governor/", "Author": "[Jim Brunner]"}
{"Content": "[ President Barack Obama is crossing his fingers that Republicans wont come close to capturing the six Senate seats they need to seize the majority in next weeks election. But for Vice President Joe Biden, theres a silver lining if Republicans fall just short. A GOP gain of five seats would effectively split the 100-member Senate between the two parties, instantly elevating the vice presidents role as the 101st senator. That would raise Bidens own profile heading into 2016, when the former Delaware senator has said he may run for president again. It makes Joe Biden suddenly a hugely relevant Washington figure, said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. It shows hes a power player. On the other hand, it could make Biden the face of messy political fights on Capitol Hill, potentially alienating some voters along the way. Biden spent nearly four decades steeped in the chambers tradition and camaraderie, and a high-profile return would allow him to show former colleagues hes still in the game. Some questions and answers about what happens if the Senate splits in November:, HAS IT EVER HAPPENED BEFORE?, Yes, but only a handful of times. The first was under President James Garfield in 1881, when a special session expected to last just 11 days stretched into 11 weeks as the Senate deadlocked, according to the Senate Historical Office. A split Senate didnt occur again until 1953, when Republican Majority Leader Robert Taft died and was replaced by a Democrat, leaving Vice President Richard Nixon as the would-be tiebreaker until other deaths gave Democrats the majority. The Senate was split 50-50 following the 2000 elections, giving Democrats majority control for 17 days beginning Jan. 3, 2001, because Al Gore was still vice president. Republicans gained power Jan. 20 when Dick Cheney was sworn in as George W. Bushs vice president. As president of the Senate, the vice president gets to cast the tie-breaking vote regardless of which party controls the Senate. But 50-50 ties are much more likely when the Senates membership is evenly split. There have been nearly 250 tie-breaking votes cast by vice presidents in U.S. history, but none by Biden. The most recent came in 2008, when Cheney cast the 51st vote for a budget amendment on the alternative minimum tax.

{"Content": "[ President Barack Obama laid claim to a peace dividend that doesnt exist when he told the nation he wants to use money saved by ending wars to build highways, schools and bridges. The wars were largely financed by borrowing, so there is no ready pile of cash to be diverted to anything else. The claim was one of several by Obama in his acceptance speech Thursday at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C. and by Vice President Joe Biden in earlier remarks that did not match the facts. A look at some of their assertions:, OBAMA: Ill use the money were no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and put more people back to work  rebuilding roads and bridges, schools and runways. After two wars that have cost us thousands of lives and over a trillion dollars, its time to do some nation-building right here at home. THE FACTS: The idea of taking war savings to pay for other programs is budgetary sleight of hand, given that the wars were paid for with increased debt. Obama can essentially pay down our debt, as he said, by borrowing less now that war is ending. But he still must borrow to do the extra nation-building he envisions. He made a similar statement in his State of the Union address, and it is no less misleading now than in January. And the savings appear to be based at least in part on inflated war spending estimates for future years. , OBAMA: We will reform and strengthen Medicare for the long haul, but well do it by reducing the cost of health care, not by asking seniors to pay thousands of dollars more. THE FACTS: Some of the proposals the Obama administration has floated in budget negotiations with Congress would ask Medicare beneficiaries to pay more. Among them: revamping co-payments and deductibles in ways that could raise costs for retirees and increasing premiums for certain beneficiaries. Obama even indicated a willingness to consider raising the eligibility age, currently 65, to 67. As word of some of the proposals leaked out, the president faced a backlash from fellow Democrats. He has since said he would not accept Medicare cuts as a part of a deficit reduction deal, unless it also includes higher taxes on the wealthy. Still, some level of increased costs for middle-class and upper-income Medicare recipients is likely to be part of any future deficit reduction deal. , OBAMA:  We can help big factories and small businesses double their exports, and if we choose this path, we can create a million new manufacturing jobs in the next four years. THE FACTS: Obama has claimed an increase of some 500,000 manufacturing jobs over the past 29 months. But this is cherry picking by the president. From the beginning of Obamas term 3 1/2 years ago, manufacturing jobs have declined by more than 500,000, according to the Labor Departments Bureau of Labor Statistics. Manufacturing jobs have been on a steady decline for nearly two decades. Even though there has been a modest uptick in manufacturing jobs this year, unless there is a major turnaround, it seems unlikely that Obamas goal of 1 million new manufacturing jobs can be reached by his target date of 2016. , OBAMA: And now you have a choice: We can give more tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas or we can start rewarding companies that open new plants and train new workers and create new jobs here in the United States of America. BIDEN:  Gov. Romney believes that in the global economy, it doesnt much matter where American companies put their money or where they create jobs. As a matter of fact, he has a new tax proposal  the territorial tax  that experts say will create 800,000 jobs, all of them overseas. THE FACTS: Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romneys proposal is actually aimed at encouraging investment in the U.S. not overseas. The U.S. currently has a global tax system that is filled with credits, exemptions and deductions that enable many companies to avoid U.S. taxes and provides an incentive for corporations to keep their profits in other countries. Whether Romneys plan would spur investment in the U.S. is debatable, but its not a plan aimed at dispersing profits abroad. Experts differ on the impact of a territorial system on employment in the U.S. But Bidens implication that Romneys plan sends jobs abroad is not supported by the expert opinion he cites. Kimberly Clausing, an economics professor at Reed College in Portland, Ore. said a pure territorial tax system could increase employment in low-tax countries by 800,000. But that did not mean U.S. jobs moving overseas. Clausing later wrote: My analysis does not speak to the effects on jobs in the United States. , OBAMA: You can choose a future where we reduce our deficit without wrecking our middle class. Independent analysis shows that my plan would cut our deficits by $4 trillion. THE FACTS: Three years ago, Obama pledged to cut in half the deficit we inherited by the end of his first term, a mark hes set to miss by a wide margin. The deficit when he took office was $1.2 trillion, and the $800 billion stimulus bill Obama signed soon afterward increased the shortfall to over $1.4 trillion. The White House predicts this years federal budget deficit will end up at $1.2 trillion, marking the fourth consecutive year of trillion dollar-plus red ink. Obamas new $4 trillion target over 10 years resets the goalposts with some fancy budget footwork. For one thing, it includes $1 trillion in cuts already signed into law. And it assumes that Congress will pass the administrations plan to raise the capital gains tax, boost taxes on households earning over $250,000 a year and impose a minimum 30 percent tax on incomes above $1 million. It also assumes a reduction in the amount of interest the government must pay on its debt. , BIDEN: After the worst job loss since the Great Depression, weve created 4.5 million private sector jobs in the past 29 months. THE FACTS: This seems to be a favorite statistic, because many speakers at the convention cited it. But its misleading  a figure that counts jobs from when the recession reached its trough and employment began to grow again. It excludes jobs lost earlier in Obamas term, and masks the fact that joblessness overall has risen over Obamas term so far. As well, in the same 29 months that private sector jobs grew by 4.5 million, jobs in the public sector declined by about 500,000, making the net gain in that period about 4 million. Overall, some 7.5 million jobs were lost during the recession that began in December 2007 in President George W. Bushs term and ended officially in June 2009 with Obama as president. Never since World War II has the economy been so slow to recover all the jobs lost in a downturn. , OBAMA: Millions of students are paying less for college today because we finally took on a system that wasted billions of taxpayer dollars on banks and lenders. THE FACTS: Technically it is true, said Bryan Cook, director of the Center for Policy Analysis at the American Council on Education. How much of a savings is not clear. Large increases in federal Pell Grants, GI Bill benefits and the 2009 American Opportunity Tax Credit led to a significant increase in the amount of aid provided to students who qualify for these benefits. The current per year maximum Pell Grant is $5,550  $900 higher than it was in 2008 for a program that serves more than 9 million students. Under the Obama administration, Congress passed legislation requiring all federal loans be issued through the Education Department; previously, they were also issued by private lenders. This will also probably mean students pay less in the long term. , OBAMA: In 2014, our longest war will be over. THE FACTS: Although most U.S. troops will leave Afghanistan by the end of 2014, thousands are likely to stay and continue a U.S. presence for years. There is no telling what fighting they might be drawn into, despite the decision to end the U.S. combat role. Military leaders and administration officials have not yet said how many will stay, asserting that such decisions are far from being made. But analysts say the U.S. envisions a post-2014 force of as many as 20,000 American troops to continue training the Afghan forces, hunt terrorists and keep watch on Iran and other nations in the region. , BIDEN: What they didnt tell you is that the plan theyve put down on paper would immediately cut benefits to more than 30 million seniors already on Medicare. What they didnt tell you is the plan theyre proposing would cause Medicare to go bankrupt by 2016. THE FACTS: Biden wasnt referring to any Medicare plan of Romney or running mate Paul Ryan, but to the consequences of fully repealing Obamas health care law, which is unpopular with seniors even though it has sweetened Medicare in certain ways. A Medicare plan put forward by Ryan in Congress would have no immediate effect because it would apply only to future retirees. Obamas health care law improved Medicare benefits, adding better coverage for beneficiaries with high prescription costs as well as removing co-pays for a set of preventive benefits. If the law is repealed, those benefits would be lost unless Congress decides otherwise. Similarly, Romneys promise to restore Obamas $716 billion in Medicare cuts could have unintended consequences for the program. The cuts dont affect seniors directly, instead falling on hospitals, insurers and other service providers. Restoring the higher payments to providers would accelerate the depletion of Medicares trust fund for inpatient care, from 2024 currently to 2016, unless Congress acts to stave that off. , Associated Press writers Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Stephen Ohlemacher, Christine Armario and Paul Wiseman contributed to this report.]", "Date": "20120910", "Title": "[Fact check: Obama and the phantom peace dividend]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/fact-check-obama-and-the-phantom-peace-dividend/", "Author": "[CALVIN WOODWARD, TOM RAUM]"}
{"Content": "[ President Obama may have done a big favor for a Seattle startup last week. Inadvertently. By weighing in on the net-neutrality debate, the president made the geeky subject a dinner-table topic for America as we head toward the 2016 election. Well now spend a year or more debating whether and how to regulate broadband, preserve the equal-access character of the Internet and limit the control telecom companies have over their networks. As we hash this out, a little outfit in Pioneer Square called Syntonic may be part of the conversation.  , Quietly started two years ago by veterans of RealNetworks, Syntonic is now emerging  and getting national media attention  with technology that adds a new dimension and complexity to the net-neutrality discussion. The 15-person Pioneer Square company is building tools that content providers, nonprofits and corporations can use to provide free access to mobile broadband networks. These tools enable new business models to cover the cost of data delivery. A movie studio, for instance, could use Syntonic to cover the data costs when people view its trailers on a mobile device. A newspaper or magazine could offer a service bundle with free access: pay an extra dollar per month, and downloads wont count against monthly data limits. Phone companies have just started dabbling with this approach, called sponsored data or zero rating  as in pay zero rates to access certain content. AT&T announced in January that it was working with Syntonic and a few other startups in the space. T-Mobile US took it further last summer when it announced a music promotion that enabled customers to stream an unlimited amount of music to their devices without having it count against their monthly data allowance. Net-neutrality advocates see this as a violation of the principle that all online content and data be treated equally. Making some content free in effect creates preferential treatment and could be moving toward pay to play content delivery, they say. People often may see this as a more acceptable breach of net neutrality; its still a breach of net neutrality, said Jeremy Malcolm, senior global-policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Yet even net-neutrality advocates like EFF are hard-pressed to oppose all applications of sponsored data. Wikipedia is working with phone companies to cover the cost of data charges when visiting its site, to ensure universal access to its repository of knowledge; its starting with developing countries where data costs can be prohibitive. Facebook is doing something similar in Africa and covering the cost of data access for wireless-phone customers in several countries. But imagine the reaction if, say, the GOP paid to provide free access to Fox News  but not CNN or MSNBC  on AT&T phones and tablets. Subsidizing the cost of mobile-data access may not seem like a big deal in prosperous cities like Seattle, where even kids may have iPhones with generous data plans. But 25 to 30 percent of the population is quite sensitive to data costs and the prospect of paying for overages, according to Chetan Sharma, an Issaquah-based wireless analyst. They could be motivated to try new services that provide free access to apps and services.  Syntonic Chief Executive Gary Greenbaum said hes trying not to take sides in the net-neutrality debate but he argues  vociferously  that consumers benefit from the service his company is building. I think what were doing is without a doubt beneficial to consumers, he said. Were enabling new business models, new modes of access, for consumers that might not have had access. Syntonic also has a philanthropic example. Its working with the Highline School District on a program providing laptops to upper-grade students. The laptops have wireless broadband so students can use education apps at home, where they might not have Internet access. The district is using Syntonic to manage and track which websites students can access. Basically, the district is sponsored access to certain types of content, via Syntonic software plugged into the carriers network. Greenbaum, who most recently worked on networking at Microsoft, after working at RealNetworks in its heyday, called Syntonics product connectivity as a service. Our connected services platform is something thats in the network and its cloud-managed, he said. That is the core technology, coupling of access with content and enforcement. Last week another application of its service was announced at a Samsung event in San Francisco. On newer Samsung devices that can toggle between work and personal modes, Syntonic can be used to divvy up wireless bills, so the company pays for work data usage and the user pays for personal data usage. Called segmented billing, it splits the data bill several ways. Then the monthly bill lists who paid for what data. Thats more transparent than approaches like television ads or contextual online ads that cover the cost to deliver content online or over the air. To me it seems inevitable that phone companies, employers and content providers will find new ways to handle data-distribution costs, with or without Syntonic. Im not sure that using these tools to provide free channels on your mobile device is as obnoxious as Comcast or AT&T selling Internet fast lanes to preferred customers. But I do know that net-neutrality advocates, from President Obama on down, will lose the crusade if they overreach and try to block startups, carriers and other companies from experimenting with new ways to cover the cost of mobile data access.

{"Content": "[ President Obamas plan to bypass Congress in shielding millions of immigrants from deportation is not the best way to do immigration reform. But if confrontation is what it takes to get House Republicans off their rear ends and deal with the problem, so be it. They dont even have to work too hard. The Senate has already written a good bill and passed it with votes from both parties. Its a comprehensive approach offering a path to citizenship for most of the estimated 11 million people who came here illegally and beefing up enforcement of the law. The measure could have passed the House on a bipartisan basis, but Republican House Speaker John Boehner didnt want to offend a conservative base opposed to any kind of amnesty. Thus, he refused to take up the bill. So what we now have is an immigration system without the beefed-up enforcement. We have the status quo. Obama tried  oh, he tried  to build confidence that these proposed immigration reforms would not fail as past ones had. He deported over 2 million immigrants at considerable political risk to Democrats. This and the lack of action on normalizing the status of those whove grown deep roots in this country may have cost the party key Hispanic support in the recent election. And what did Obama get in return from the House GOP? Zip. Now its hardball, and the ball is hurtling onto the Republican court. Fortunately, the Republican freshmen seem a more pragmatic bunch. They could dilute the power of a hard right for whom stopping Obama is the only creed  and it doesnt matter over what. Obamas executive action most likely will offer several million immigrants a reprieve against deportation. This is not a path to citizenship or permanent-resident green card. Its simply an assurance that for the time being, undocumented immigrants need not fear being removed. New arrivals will still be deported, as will those involved in criminal activity. If congressional Republicans dont like what Obamas doing, they have a remedy. They can write and pass an immigration law. We assume they havent forgotten how to do that over the past six years. Meanwhile, the tantrums have got to stop. Some on the right are already threatening to shut down the government, an antic sure to enrage the public. Boehner is talking tough  more to calm the fringe, we assume, than a reflection of his own views. Hes suggested a triple play: fighting the president tooth and nail, suing him and shutting down the government. Surely, Republicans dont want an ugly row over this issue. They dont want the likes of Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, issuing ethnic slurs, and that will happen if they let this fester. Hispanic voters will be out in greater force come the 2016 presidential election. And though polls show Latinos more nuanced on immigration matters than the political stereotypes would have it, no one likes being demonized. Lets be clear on this: Our immigration laws, though generous, must be respected. We cant ignore the plight of low-skilled American workers suffering depressed wages and high unemployment in part because of competition from immigrants who came here illegally. America needs a new page on immigration, and that page cant be turned until we deal with the millions in this country illegally. Deporting many, many millions is not going to happen; its unthinkable. The great majority of unauthorized immigrants are fine people and hard workers. That said, future immigrants must have papers. Republican leaders should stop wasting time and get the job done  for the good of the country, as well as themselves. The immigration reform game must end. Froma Harrop is on Twitter @FromaHarrop.

{"Content": "[ Press that white button! This right here, the former secretary of state instructed a technologically deficient fan in New Hampshire who was fumbling to work an iPhone camera. Her patience thinning, Hillary Rodham Clinton took matters into her own hands and jabbed the button herself. And with the sound of an electronic shutter snap, another selfie  the must-have political souvenir of 2016  went up into the cloud for campaign posterity. Who wants their babies kissed or their yard signs autographed anymore? This is the Selfie Election. And if you are running for president, you have no choice but to submit. Candidates can now spend an hour  or sometimes two, as Sen. Rand Paul did last month in New Hampshire  exhausting a line of eager selfie seekers. Others, like Sen. Ted Cruz, have learned to add an extra 20 minutes at the beginning and end of events because so many people want pictures. Jeb Bush has perfected a technique suited to his 6-foot-3 frame: For his shorter fans, he will take the picture with his own outstretched selfie stick of an arm. The sons of Gov. Scott Walker have watched their father take so many, they say he has significantly polished his shutterbug skills. Gov. Chris Christies staff says he has taken too many to count. But as campaigns adjust to a new self-focused social-media world, some are left wondering whether more meaningful voter-candidate interactions are suffering. When candidates oblige so many people, some requesting multiple takes to straighten that smile, square a double chin or get a pesky photo bomber out of the frame, are they losing the chance to clarify a policy position, listen to concerns or even just look a voter in the eye?, Its self-serving, and the candidate is kind of screwed, said Craig Robinson, a former political director of the Iowa Republican Party. They just have to put up with it, because how do you decipher who is a fan and who wants to fill their profile with pictures of them with candidates? said Robinson, now the editor of The Iowa Republican, a political publication. Indeed, it is not always clear whether the people asking for photographs even like or plan to vote for the candidate they are posing with, or whether they just want a Facebook trophy to flaunt. Not all candidates care to oblige. Please stop, Ben Carson, the retired pediatric neurosurgeon and Republican presidential hopeful, wrote in a recent opinion piece for The Washington Post that raised a jarring if somewhat hyperbolic concern: Selfies kill. Beyond the obvious narcissism of endlessly photographing oneself and blasting it over social networks for others to admire, selfies are dangerous, he went on, citing a few examples of how inattentive selfie snappers had met their demise. (Falling off a cliff in Portugal, for example.), Former President Clinton has complained that he is inundated with requests whenever he goes out in public. At an event last year with another former president, George W. Bush, Clinton observed that even eating out had become a challenge  to which Bush cracked, At least theyre still asking. President Obama has had to draw the line before. I want to warn in advance, I cant do a selfie with everybody, he told a crowd last month. Few people embody the selfie craze like Maggie Fitzgerald, a lobbyist in Des Moines, Iowa, who has maneuvered her way into photos with politicians willing and unwilling. Her biggest gets: Donald Trump, Rick Perry and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, whom she found eager and obliging, and Clinton, Paul and Carson, who seemed much less enthusiastic. Sometimes theyll ask me, Dont you want a normal picture? Fitzgerald said in an interview. No, I just want a selfie. She is undecided in the race, but said she gained some insight into the candidates by their demeanor during selfies. Most of them arent stiff about it, Fitzgerald added. Some of them might be. But they shouldnt be president. Then there are those who see the selfie as just one more example of how people have become slaves to their devices at the expense of human interaction. Queen Elizabeth II has said she finds the trend disconcerting and indicated she misses eye contact with her subjects. For security teams on the campaigns, all this close contact between candidates and strangers can be a challenge, but in some ways it is easier to monitor than a traditional rope line. That is because selfies keep peoples hands up where they can be seen. Many campaigns say they are benefiting after posing for all those pictures. When shared on Facebook and Instagram, they can exponentially increase a candidates visibility, spreading an authentic memento that helps extend the chatter around a rally beyond those who attended. This is something that campaigns should embrace and be very happy with, because its just free advertising, said Pauls chief digital strategist, Vincent Harris. The Paul campaign sees a branding opportunity. When people line up for photos, campaign aides often erect a backdrop with a Rand logo on it for people to pose in front of. These exercises have also resulted in a little horizon broadening for Paul, who picked up a new term on the trail: Us-ie, a selfie with multiple people. The ubiquity of camera phones at campaign stops is forcing aides to become proficient in operating different brands. Rick Tyler, an aide to Cruz, said the staff member who usually traveled with the senator was now well versed in how to quickly snap pictures with a Samsung Galaxy versus an iPhone. The demand for selfies has grown so much, he added, that even walking just a short distance from one event to another can be an ordeal. Our schedulers will say to me: Hes just going 100 steps. Why would it take 20 minutes to get there? Tyler said. Well, travel with us and youll see. Sen. Lindsey Graham said he could probably benefit from losing 15 pounds to make his selfies a bit more flattering. But his attitude toward selfies is upbeat: Society, he said, is richer for the selfie. When we take selfies and chat, its the beauty of American democracy, Graham said. I dont think Putin really does this, he added, referring to President Vladimir Putin of Russia. I dont think he probably has to worry about selfies. Sen. Marco Rubio will indulge people who want selfies. But he often travels with a professional photographer who takes photos of him with voters as an aide trails behind, handing out index cards listing a website where supporters can go to download their pictures. The benefit? Not only does the photographer speed the process and produce higher-quality images, but voters are asked to provide personal information on Rubios website. Before they can view their photos, Rubio supporters have told the campaign their name, their home and email addresses, which issues matter most to them and if they are willing to volunteer. Even voters who embrace the selfie culture can seem slightly conflicted. Just take Lincoln Boyd, 22, who sneaked up to the stage at a recent conservative gathering and captured a selfie with Rubio that quickly went viral. In a telephone interview, Boyd said he would have preferred to grill Rubio, asking him, Why werent you able to corral the Republicans to get behind immigration? But, he added, theres a time and a place for that. And, Boyd explained: Were millennials, its the 21st century, and if Im with the candidate and I can get a quick picture with him, Im going to do that.]", "Date": "20150704", "Title": "[The Selfie Election: snap, share  win?]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/selfie-requests-shift-focus-of-presidential-campaigns/", "Author": "[JEREMY W.

{"Content": "[ Probable Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker says hewouldnt rule out a full-scale American re-invasion of Iraq if the national interests of this country are at stake. Appearing on ABCsThis Weekon Sunday, the Wisconsin governorinitially demurred when interviewerJonathan Karl asked if hed rule out a full-blown U.S. re-invasion of Iraq and Syria. I dont think we should ever send a message to our foes as to how far were willing to go,Walker said. He doesnt think its necessary to send U.S. troops now, he said, but he would not rule out boots on the ground. He made a similar comment in February, saying he wouldnt rule anything out, including sending U.S. ground troops to Syria to fight the Islamic State militant group, as commander-in-chief. Asked again if hed be open to launching a full-scale re- invasion of Iraq, Walker kept that option open. If the national interests of this country are at stake, here at risk in this country or abroad, thats to me the standard of what we do for military engagement, he said. Walker said in a statement last month that knowing what we know now, we should not have gone into Iraq in 2003, and accused President Barack Obama of making the situation there worse. In the ABC interview,Walker also said he would support a constitutional amendment to affirm that states can prohibit same-sex marriage if the Supreme Court legalizes it this month. He described former Florida Governor Jeb Bush as a formidable rival in the Republican primary because hes going to have more money than just about all of us combined. WASHINGTON  After being the focus of Hillary Rodham Clintons criticism of voter registration laws, Republicans shot back on Sunday, lambasting the former secretary of State and front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination as out of touch with states rights. She doesnt know what shes talking about, said New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in an interview on CBSs Face the Nation. In New Jersey, we have early voting. In a speech last week, Clinton castigated Christie, former Govs. Jeb Bush of Florida and Rick Perry of Texas, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker for deliberately seeking to disenfranchise voters throughout the nation with laws that make it harder to cast ballots. Christie, who will decide this month if he will run for the Republican presidential nomination, vetoed a Democratic bill in 2013 that would have expanded in-person early voting in the state. Speaking on Face the Nation, Christie said he doesnt want to expand early voting and increase the opportunities for fraud. And maybe thats what Mrs. Clinton wants to do. I dont know. But the fact is that the folks in New Jersey have plenty of an opportunity to vote, he said. Perry, who last week announced his second bid for the Republican nomination, dismissed Clintons comments as ridiculous. Its way outside the norm of ridiculous, if you want to know the truth of the matter, to call out the people of the state of Texas, because thats what she did, Perry said on CNNs State of the Union. In Texas, Perry signed into law a measure that requires the states estimated 14 million registered voters to show photo identification to cast a ballot. The law, which has faced several legal battles, was allowed to take effect last fall by the Supreme Court. Republican-led legislatures have in recent years passed measures, including voter-identification requirements and time restrictions imposed on early voting, which have been widely criticized by Democrats as moves to disenfranchise minority voters. Clinton, in her Houston speech, called for automatic voter registration, which would register every American citizen at 18  similar to a recently passed state law in Oregon. Moreover, she called on the Republican-led Congress to reinstate a key provision of the Voting Rights Act that had required states with a historic pattern of restricting minorities from voting to get federal approval before making changes to election laws. The Supreme Court in 2013 struck down the provision. I think this would have a profound impact on our elections and our democracy, she said. WASHINGTON  New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says hed revive enforcement of federal marijuana law in states that have legalized recreational use of the drug if he were president. And he says if that position causes him political trouble in battleground Colorado, so be it. He says he wont pander to voters or hide his positions for political expediency. Federal and some state laws on marijuana are in conflict. But the federal government has adopted a hands-off approach to states with lenient marijuana laws. The Justice Department has told such states that it wont challenge their laws so long as marijuana is tightly regulated. Colorado is one of them. Christie spoke Sunday on CBS Face the Nation. He says hell decide this month whether to seek the Republican presidential nomination. WASHINGTON  Republican presidential contender Lindsey Graham says his party has room for transgender people like Caitlyn Jenner. The South Carolina senator calls himself a traditional marriage kind of guy. But he says he can only imagine the torment that Bruce Jenner went through before becoming a transgender woman. He hopes that, now, shes found peace. The underdog Republican candidate is campaigning on the need to counter threats from terrorists and Islamic State militants. He shares the opposition to same-sex marriage expressed by his rivals but says the Supreme Court is settling that question. Graham says if Jenner wants to be a Republican, shes welcome. And he says if she wants a safe country and a strong economy, she should vote for him. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders boldly predicted Saturday that he would beat Democratic presidential rival and heavy favorite Hillary Rodham Clinton in the 2016 New Hampshire primary, expected to be in early February. Let me tell you a secret: were going to win New Hampshire, Sanders told upward of 1,000 supporters gathered in Keene, N.H. the Keene Sentinelreported. Sanders, 73, has drawn large crowds as he campaigns across Iowa and New Hampshire. Clinton, meanwhile, has continued her low-key listening tour before a June 13 campaign event at New Yorks Roosevelt Island that is expected to kick off a more outgoing phase of her quest for the White House. A Bloomberg Politics/Saint Anselm poll in May found Clinton leading Sanders in New Hampshire by a margin of 62-18 percent, but Sanders support has grown as he continues to deliver a populist message on the campaign trail. In my view, the issue of wealth and income inequality is the great moral issue of our time, it is the great economic issue of our time, and it is the great political issue of our time, Sanders said Saturday. While Sanders didnt mention Clinton by name in his stump speech, he was asked by a reporter afterward whether the former secretary of states lack of a concrete position on the Trans- Pacific Partnership, a potential trade deal involving the U.S. and much of the Pacific Rim, was hurting her campaign. On Sanders Senate website he calls the TPP disastrous. Call her up and ask her, Sanders said.

{"Content": "[ Remember the scary  some would say sensationalized  simulation video of the Alaskan Way Viaduct along the Seattle waterfront collapsing in a magnitude 7.0 earthquake?, City of Seattle engineers say the destruction shown in the video, released by the state during the campaign to replace the viaduct with a tunnel, is a pretty good approximation of what would happen to the aging waterfront seawall in a comparable earthquake. Within 30 seconds, the soil beneath Alaskan Way liquefies and pushes against the seawall, collapsing it. The roadway, sidewalks and pier ends buckle and tip into Elliott Bay. Major utility lines break, cutting power and rupturing gas pipes. The damage to the state ferry dock, railroads, streets and historic buildings is extensive. Seattle voters will be asked in the Nov. 6 general election to approve a $290 million bond measure to replace the waterfront seawall, built between 1915 and 1936 and badly eroded over the years by marine borers and tides. The 30-year bond measure would cost $59 per year for the owner of a median-valued, $360,000 home. The measure requires 60 percent approval to pass. There is a clear and present danger to public safety if it is not replaced. Its time for us to act, said Bob Davidson, president and CEO of the Seattle Aquarium and a member of the Save Our Seawall campaign, which supports the ballot measure. And unlike the divisive tunnel issue, city leaders including Mayor Mike McGinn and the entire City Council support the seawall replacement. Weve patched the seawall together for so many years. We can no longer postpone it. This is one of those housekeeping tasks a city has to undertake, said Councilmember Tom Rasmussen, chairman of the Transportation Committee. Rasmussen also notes the city is on a tight timeline. Removal of the viaduct, now scheduled for 2016, and the reconstruction of Alaskan Way cant be completed until the seawall is rebuilt. Who should pay?, Opponents, including some of the activists who argued against the tunnel, call the threats of a seawall collapse scaremongering claptrap. And they say that because waterfront businesses and property owners stand to benefit the most from the seawall replacement, those private-property owners, and not the city as a whole, should pay for the improvements. They argue that a Local Improvement District is more appropriate. The people who benefit from a project should pay for the project, said Christopher Brown, a retired traffic and transportation engineer who, along with Ed Plute, wrote the statement Against Proposition 1 for the Seattle Voters Guide. Brown says the benefits of the project diminish the farther one gets from Elliott Bay. Why should Northgate be taxed for 30 years so Ivars can get a free ride?, Brown calls the citys expensive, long-range plans to redesign the waterfront to create a series of parks and open spaces lunacy, and notes that this is the most valuable real estate in a several-state radius. But Bob Donegan, president of Ivars, on Pier 54, said that while businesses own and maintain their own piers, its the citys seawall. Donegan said the seawall protects critical transportation and communication infrastructure for the region, not just a few businesses. Every utility in downtown goes through Alaskan Way  sewer, water, fiber optics, natural gas, electricity  as well as freight and railroad lines. If the seawall fails and those are lost, the whole city and region goes down, he said. Donegan noted that a Local Improvement District is part of the financing plan for the redesigned waterfront park, where local property owners will more directly benefit from removal of the viaduct and the creation of new public spaces. But Donegan concedes the grand plan for a parkway that re-connects the city to Elliott Bay depends on a rebuilt seawall. We cant realize our vision of the waterfront without it, he said. Quiet campaign, To date, neither campaign has been very visible. The Save Our Seawall group had raised $180,000 through Oct. 5. Davidson said supporters plan to send several direct mailers to likely voters in the coming weeks, but they wont distribute yard signs or buy TV ads. The opponents have not raised any money. Speakers from both sides have argued their cases to political and municipal groups. So far, the proponents have picked up the major endorsements, including the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, the King County Labor Council, the League of Women Voters Seattle-King County, the environmental group Futurewise and all of the citys Democratic legislative districts. The bond measure would fund Phase 1of the seawall replacement from South Washington Street to Virginia Street, the oldest and most vulnerable section, the city says. An additional $30 million for the project would come from the city and also $30 million from the King County Flood Control District. Whats a seawall?, The seawall is not just a vertical face. Near the historic piers, between about Madison Street and University Street, the wall extends 60 feet under Alaskan Way, to the support columns of the viaduct. Part of the seawall is concrete. Part is made up of 20,000 old-growth timbers. Behind the wall face and around the supports is fill  silt, dirt and whatever else the workers poured in years ago, said Jennifer Wieland, seawall-project manager with the Seattle Department of Transportation. City engineers knew the wall was in bad shape, but it wasnt clear just how bad until after the Nisqually earthquake. Engineers assessing damage in 2002 excavated large chunks of decaying timbers, casualties of gribbles, a tiny, shrimplike crustacean with a voracious appetite for wood. The city estimates about half of the seawall is deteriorated and has a 1-in-10 chance of failing in a major earthquake in the next 10 years. Part of the complexity and cost of the project is the need to coordinate the seawall construction with the states Highway 99 tunnel project. If the bond measure fails, city leaders say, it would leave the waterfront at risk and delay viaduct removal and Alaskan Way reconstruction. The bond measure also would rebuild the public piers to either side of the Aquarium that are badly deteriorated, and it would restore shoreline habitat. The city plans to create a small beach at the foot of Washington Street. Planners also hope to re-establish a migration corridor for juvenile salmon by raising the seafloor next to the wall and designing new sidewalks that sunlight can penetrate. Currently, no light reaches beneath the existing piers and the seafloor is nearly lifeless, Wieland said. Lynn Thompson: 206-464-8305 or lthompson@seattletimes.com.

{"Content": "[ Republican proposals to move up the states late-season presidential primary failed Tuesday, leaving Washington with one of the last votes in the nation. The Presidential Primary Committee met in SeaTac and voted along party lines, failing to shift the states May 24 primary next year to March, when about 30 states are scheduled to hold a primary or caucus. Washingtons primary wont have much direct impact on how the presidential nominees are chosen. Democrats will select all their delegates through caucus meetings, while Republicans may choose some of theirs through the primary. Nonetheless, state Secretary of State Kim Wyman said Tuesday she would like the primary to go forward. I realized that the voters want to weigh in  and they dont really care about the party rules, Wyman, a Republican, said Tuesday after the committee meeting. She had proposed moving the primary to March 8 to draw more interest from candidates, and possibly voters. But Democrats on the committee opposed that proposal and another plan to set the primary for March 22. The committee has nine members, with four Democrats, four Republicans and Wyman, and neither proposal got the six votes necessary to change the primary schedule. Wyman said she called for the change because, I really believe that the May 24 date is too late in the process for it to be meaningful for voters or candidates. Wed like to use that primary as a way to get candidates to come to our state and not just fundraise, but to campaign, she added later. Democrats at the meeting cited their national partys rules  as well as the possibility of confusing voters  as reasons not to move up the primary. State Democratic Party Chairman Jaxon Ravens said the national party required rules to be made earlier this year. And that decision, made by state Democrats, was to allocate our delegates through the use of caucuses, said Ravens. The Democratic caucuses are scheduled for March 26. One committee member, Sen. Sharon Nelson, D-Maury Island, worried that a primary held earlier than that date could confuse voters. They will go to the polls and vote and  they will think they are choosing delegates, said Nelson, adding later: This will create a confusion that I dont think benefits citizens of the state. The Legislature this year approved $11.5 million to pay for the primary, which was canceled in 2012 as the state continued to recover from the Great Recession. During the meeting, committee member Rep. Matt Manweller, R-Ellensburg, proposed what he described as a fair compromise, holding the primary March 22, near the time of the Democratic caucuses so as not to confuse. And, It would maintain some relevance for the $11 million that were going to spend to do this, said Manweller. That idea also failed to gain traction with Democrats, some of whom have questioned spending money for a primary. I dont know why the Legislature wants to spend $11.5 million on a process that were not using to select our delegates, Ravens said earlier this year.]", "Date": "20150811", "Title": "[Bid to hold states presidential primary earlier in 2016 voted down]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/vote-keeps-presidential-primary-late-in-campaign-season/", "Author": "[Joseph OSullivan]"}
{"Content": "[ Republicans called it a win for religious freedom. The decision of the Supreme Court, they said, is further evidence the countrys new health care law is deeply flawed. The claims of victory arrived almost immediately after the high court ruled Monday that some companies need not provide contraception to women as required by President Barack Obamas signature domestic policy achievement. Yet theres a risk for the GOP in crowing too loudly. Republicans for years have tried to make inroads with two groups that tend to favor Democrats: women and younger voters. And as popular as the courts decision will be with the Republican base, its likely to be just as unpopular this year and into 2016 with those who depend on insurance to pay for birth control  a group that includes women and younger voters. The thought of your boss telling you what kind of birth control you can and cant get is offensive and it certainly is motivating to women to vote, said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, which plans to spend several million dollars this year to campaign for Senate candidates. The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that some companies can hold religious objections allowing them to opt out of health laws birth control coverage requirement. While the ruling does not address the heart of the Affordable Care Act, its a setback for Democrats and amplifies a longstanding argument from conservatives that the law they call Obamacare intrudes on religious liberties as part of a larger government overreach. This is a clear and decisive defeat against Obamacare and a victory for the rights of all Americans, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a fundraising appeal distributed less than three hours after the Supreme Court ruling. But Republican leaders such as Priebus were careful to avoid mentioning the impact on women and their reproductive rights, underscoring the delicate balance the GOP must strike as it works to improve its image among women. The party is still recovering from a series of insensitive comments made by GOP candidates in the 2012 election, including Missouri U.S. Senate candidate Todd Akin, whose campaign crumbled after he said womens bodies were able to avoid pregnancy in cases of legitimate rape. Republicans have to be careful about not appearing as though theyre anti-contraception. This is a constitutional issue, said Katie Packer Gage, a GOP strategist whose firm advises Republicans on navigating womens issues. We have to be very, very cautious as a party. Polls suggest that most people  and a larger majority of women  think for-profit companies should be required to cover the cost of birth control. A Gallup survey conducted in May found that 90 percent of Americans, including 88 percent of Republicans, see the use of birth control as morally acceptable. Democrats said the ruling would shine a spotlight on access to birth control and dovetail with a strategy by the party to mobilize female voters on issues such as raising the minimum wage and supporting pay equity for women. In Colorado, for example, Democratic Sen. Mark Udalls first TV ad noted Republican Rep. Cory Gardners past sponsorship of a bill to outlaw abortions in cases of rape and incest and support for an effort to grant an embryo the same legal rights as a person, which could have outlawed some types of birth control and all abortions. Gardner now says he opposes the personhood measure. In Iowa, Democrats have signaled plans to highlight Republican Joni Ernsts support of a personhood amendment to the states constitution. In Michigan, Democrats backing Senate candidate Gary Peters have sought to tarnish Republican Terri Lynn Lands record on reproductive rights, prompting her to air her own ad in April declaring, As a woman, I might know a little bit more about women than Gary Peters. It wont be clear until November whether women will respond to such appeals. Fewer young women typically vote in midterm elections compared with presidential years. And they are particularly disengaged from this years races: 63 percent of women under age 30 in an AP-GfK poll conducted before the ruling reported they dont care very much which party wins control of Congress. Just 21 percent said they were certain to vote in November. Writing for the courts conservative majority, Justice Samuel Alito suggested the White House could resolve the issue by broadening a birth control compromise it created earlier for religion-oriented nonprofits. In those cases a third party  usually an insurer  can cover contraceptives at no charge to the affected employees, and the government absorbs the cost. But White House spokesman Josh Earnest signaled the administration may not take that route. Instead, he challenged Congress to pass legislation to address the coverage gap for women. That could put some Republicans in a difficult spot politically, but not right away. For now, theyre enjoying what many viewed as a win. When Obamacare and its impact on people is front and center in the political debate, its just not good news for Democrats, Republican strategist Kevin Madden said.

{"Content": "[ Republicans have made the Mountain West a stronghold, which is why brewing party brawls in Wyoming, Idaho and Utah are bedeviling loyalists who yearn for GOP unity. Closely watched elections this month in Virginia and New Jersey did little to resolve the growing struggle between tea partyers and the Republican establishment. Now, some of the sharpest infighting is shifting to the rugged Big Sky region, where the tea party scored its first major victory, ousting a veteran Republican U.S. senator in a Utah party convention three years ago. We have to have this fight, said U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, an Idaho Republican facing a tea party challenger next May as he seeks a ninth House term. The struggle will continue well into the next presidential race, he said. Simpson and three-term U.S. Sen. Mike Enzi from neighboring Wyoming are chief targets of tea party and anti-establishment groups that prize ideological purity above all, even if it leads to legislative defeats. Its not enough, these groups say, that both men hold top ratings from conservative organizations such as the National Rifle Association. Republicans run little risk of losing congressional races to Democrats in Idaho, Wyoming and Utah. But if longtime incumbents such as Simpson and Enzi can fend off their GOP challengers next year, the results conceivably could lessen the tea partys zeal and reputation nationwide. That might encourage mainstream Republicans such as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie who are considering running for the White House in 2016. On the other hand, a new string of tea party victories could ignite a full-blown Republican civil war and embolden anti-establishment champions such as U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. All across the country, Republicans are watching to see where big donors, especially from the business world, will put their money and energy. In Idaho, the Club for Growth is backing Simpsons challenger, lawyer Bryan Smith. The group helped topple GOP incumbents last year, including longtime U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, whose seat eventually fell to a Democrat. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which sometimes spars with the Club for Growth, has yet to say which candidates it will support. Simpson, however, was a featured speaker at a chamber event this month in Washington, D.C. If nothing else, next years congressional elections in the Rockies hold the potential for fierce, even nasty confrontations between elected Republicans and their challengers. In Wyoming, its time for a new generation of leaders, says Liz Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney. Her differences with Enzi, 69, seem largely stylistic and generational. She calls Barack Obama the most radical president ever. The soft-spoken Enzi rarely employs such bombast, even if he routinely opposes Obamas initiatives. Cheneys decision to oppose Enzi has dismayed many prominent Republicans and opened painfully personal rifts. Her father is a hero to many Wyoming conservatives. But many other well-known Republicans, including U.S. Sen. John Barrasso and former U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson, have rallied to Enzis side. Enzis supporters call Cheney, who lived for years in Virginia, a carpetbagger and opportunist. They gleefully point to her early missteps, including a late property tax payment and a $220 fine involving her application for a fishing license reserved for longtime state residents. Cheney is airing a TV ad that calls her five children fifth-generation Wyomingites. In Idaho, Mike Simpson is a burly, cigarette-smoking dentist whose district sprawls eastward from Boise to the Wyoming-Utah border, nearly 300 miles away. Snow-streaked mountains tower above hard-pressed former railroad towns and tourist-driven ski and snowmobile resorts. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney beat Obama here by a 2-to-1 margin in 2012. Simpson, a more gregarious talker than Smith, likes to say, Ill put my conservative credentials against anybodys. He notes that he voted 40 times to halt or delay Obamas health care law. But unlike Idahos other three members of Congress, Simpson didnt vote to continue last months partial government shutdown beyond 16 days. Tea partyers insisted the shutdown go on, even though it was hurting the Republican Partys image. They also note that Simpson joined House GOP leaders 11 months ago in backing a resolution that raised taxes on the rich, but not on the remainder of Americans. Those were common-sense agreements that averted worse outcomes, Simpson said at a suburban coffee shop in Boise, the states biggest city. Because nearly all Republicans strongly oppose higher taxes, increased regulations and the presidents health care law, he said, the partys split is over strategy, not philosophy. The next two elections, Simpson said, will determine whether the Republican Party is going to be a governing majority, or whether were going to resign ourselves to be an ideologically pure minority. That sounds like surrender to Smith. The incumbent, he says, is part of Washingtons go along to get along crowd. In interviews and public settings, Smith sticks to tea party talking points. On a recent blustery night in a bare-bones meeting hall in southeastern Idaho, Smith told a small gathering its impossible to defund the health law as long as Democrats control the Senate and White House. Nonetheless, he said, he proudly sides with those who are willing to stand up and fight for conservative principles, even if their efforts have no legislative chance. Smith, whose speaking style is earnest and deadpan, has yet to prove he can raise enough money and excitement to beat Simpson. But some conservative state legislators, including Idaho Rep. Janet Trujillo, support him. Trujillo rejects claims that Republicans cant win presidential elections unless they temper their rhetoric on social issues, especially when addressing minority, female and young voters. The party is going to have to get back to its conservative roots, she said, and candidates such as Smith can help do that. The GOPs internal angst in the West also reaches U.S. Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. Hes the one who rocked Republican circles in 2010 by ousting U.S. Sen. Robert Bennett in a state party convention. Lee accused Bennett of being too conciliatory with Democrats. Establishment Republicans, including big fundraisers for Romney, are openly criticizing Lees recent take-no-prisoners tactics, including his doomed efforts to bar money for what Republicans call Obamacare. Lees Senate website now depicts a bridge symbolizing efforts to close the gaping hole in the Republican Party that separates the grass roots from establishment leaders. Trent Clark, a former Idaho GOP chairman, says the loss of manufacturing and ranching jobs in many Western areas contributes to social unease and an openness to the tea partys throw out the hierarchy message. Many Idahoans detest a $17 trillion federal debt, he said, and they feel there is no more room for compromise in Washingtons budget talks. But Republicans who refuse to cut the best possible deals with Democrats, Clark said, are not being strategic. He said he backs politicians such as Simpson who can make some headway on these issues. Thats the idealism vs. pragmatism decision that millions of Republican voters must make in upcoming primaries. It already troubles Dennis Turner, one of the 18 people who showed up for Smiths public forum in Montpelier this month. At 81, Turners face is as craggy as the land he ranched and farmed until two years ago. His conservatism is just as deeply etched. He told Smith that the United Nations is trying to take over, with the help of our president, and ruin the Second Amendment and take our guns from us. That makes Turner a true-blue tea partyer and Smith supporter, right? Maybe not. In an interview, Turner said he generally likes Smiths politics, but he thinks Simpson has done a good job in Congress. If Smith replaces Simpson as the Republican nominee, Turner said, Democrats might have a chance to win the seat, even in Idaho. Asked whether he prefers Simpson or Smith, Turner thought a moment and said, I wouldnt make that call just now.

{"Content": "[ Richard Rorty, one of Americas most influential philosophers, wrote only occasionally about politics. He once wrote, National pride is to countries what self-respect is to individuals: a necessary condition for self-improvement. Donald Trump is busy proving that our national pride is on the verge of turning into a national lampoon. In my last column, I argued that a credible third party or independent presidential campaign is an obvious and excellent way to spur some civic pride and stem the governments bleeding legitimacy. It is, after all, how most democracies break partisan ruts. So why now  and how?, First off, the conditions are ripe. The American economy right now worships disruption. Cable TV disrupted the networks; the Internet disrupted everything; Uber disrupted taxis; Airbnb disrupted hotels. If such transformations  such improvements  are possible in business, why not in politics? Democrats and Republicans are the last, best monopolists. The political market wants it. In September 2014, Gallup asked Americans, In your view, do the Republican and Democratic parties do an adequate job of representing the American people, or do they do such a poor job that a third party is needed? A clear majority, 58 percent, wanted a third party. Thats been true since 2006. Also, there is no incumbent in 2016. There have never been more independent voters. The parties favorability ratings have never been worse. Trust in government is at an all-time low. But what really makes a political disruption possible this year is money. The Supreme Court has fully deregulated the politics market. Presidential campaigns can raise capital easier than Silicon Valley tech darlings. A credible startup campaign could snag a $500 million initial political offering no sweat, given the right business model. That might be gross, but its true. The business model also would have to be new  entrepreneurial. The classic model of a political party is that a movement forms and eventually picks a leader democratically. That wont work now because the two-party duopoly has made the barriers to entry too high. Success requires money and organization to get on all the state ballots. It also requires that a candidate have poll numbers of 15 percent or higher in September 2016 to qualify for the presidential debates, which means the candidate has to be well known and well sold. All that means that a 2016 disruption needs to be top-down. It will need to ride on a wave of disgust with the status quo instead of on a field of grass roots. (Donald Trumps political vandalism doesnt count.) The good news is that this might attract candidates who would never run in the current perverted process. Heres a scenario:, An insurgent cadre, call it the Declaration of Independence Alliance, forms what is essentially a venture-political-capital firm, staking upfront the money necessary to run a competitive general election campaign, say $500 million minimum. The Koch brothers have proved that a national organization easily as competent as the parties can be built from scratch. The alliance has to bring non-contributors into its leadership and it has to be truly transparent about money and process. The war cry has to be political reform, fixing a corrupted system and breaking partisan gridlock. That means proposals such as constitutional amendments to allow campaign-finance regulation; creating four-year terms in the House; mandating shorter political campaigns (like every other democracy); changing ballot access laws; reforming the tax code. The alliance has to recruit a CEO  a presidential candidate. It could be done partly in a smoke-filled room, partly through e-voting  direct democracy. On July 4, 2016, the alliance announces its ticket for president, vice president and as many Senate seats as possible  in case they win the White House. Potential candidates? There are true disrupters: Michael Bloomberg, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, Howard Schultz of Starbucks or Eric Schmidt of Google. There are radical centrists and party orphans: Maine Sen. Angus King, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb (flirting now with a Democratic campaign) and former Govs. Jon Huntsman of Utah, Mitch Daniels of Indiana and Brian Schweitzer of Montana. They all have been mentioned. I know. Theres no slam-dunk name. There isnt going to be a slam-dunk name in this era. There isnt going to be a political hero. Sorry. The long and even less inspiring list of candidates from the two big parties confirms that. So a Schultz-Schweitzer ticket? Bloomberg-King? Schmidt-Sandberg? Who knows?, Maybe none of them is far enough from the mainstream to find a new current. Maybe none of them can run without sounding like just another pol. Maybe the top-down model is too compromised. And maybe the whole centrist-reform third way thing is too wimpy. But as unrealistic as my plot seems, it is more unrealistic to expect more than were getting from the current duopoly.

{"Content": "[ SAN FRANCISCO (AP)  It wasnt quite hipster Jeb Bush who arrived at a San Francisco startup via ride-share service Uber but the Republican presidential contender did his best Thursday to show hes not part of what he called the ho-hum stagnation of Washington. Bush told a town-hall event that as president, he would embrace the kind of bottoms-up thinking common in startup culture to shake up schools, health care and business culture. His message? Get Washington out of the way. He addressed about 75 employees of Thumbtack, a company that links customers to service providers such as house painters and photographers. The government today in Washington looks more like General Motors in 1975, he said. The government of the future needs to look more like Thumbtack. The former Florida governors fundraising swing through the Bay Area is meant to highlight differences with Democratic contender Hillary Rodham Clinton, especially in the realms of technology and business. Uber, for example, connects travelers with various cars through its smartphone app. It has come under fire for classifying its drivers as independent contractors, not employees, so they arent eligible for overtime pay, unemployment insurance or workers compensation. Clinton has promised to crack down on companies that wrongly classify workers as contractors. She has praised the so-called gig economy for creating exciting opportunities, but said it is raising hard questions about workplace protections. Bush said if companies such as Uber are violating laws and exploiting workers, there are ways to address it. The fact is, this is disrupting the old order. In taking questions from the audience, he also said he would repeal President Barack Obamas health care law in favor of a model that lets consumers select their own coverage, such as high-deductible, low-premium plans free of mandates. He called the Federal Communications Commissions latest efforts to regulate Internet broadband providers a stupid idea. Major Silicon Valley content providers such as Netflix support regulating the companies that provide Internet access. The audience was enthusiastic and polite, asking about firearms background checks, wages for women and discrimination against gays and lesbians. Bush said employers should not discriminate based on sexual orientation, but he would leave such laws up to states. Thumbtack co-founder and CEO Marco Zappacosta, who declined to say who would get his vote for president, said he does not know how many Republicans he has on staff. He was surprised when Bushs team called about a visit. I think the staff was excited that somebody wanted to come engage with us and that we would have a forum for asking them questions, he said. Bushs visit comes as a new Associated Press-GfK poll finds that negative views of the GOP candidate, the younger brother of former President George W. Bush, have ticked up. Forty-four percent say they have an unfavorable view, up from 36 percent in April. Among Republicans, 53 percent have a favorable view of Bush and 27 percent have an unfavorable view.

{"Content": "[ SAN JOSE, Calif.  Donald Trump, who declared during his presidential campaign announcement that Mexican immigrants were rapists and killers, took to Twitter on Friday to use San Franciscos fatal shooting at Pier 14 to once again slam illegal immigration and call for stronger border control. Trump tweeted out his heartfelt condolences to Kate Steinle and her family. Steinle, 32, was shot and killed Wednesday by 45-year-old Francisco Sanchez, police said, while she was walking with her father and a family friend along the pier. Sanchez, who had five times been deported, was released in April after a judge dismissed drug charges against him. Before his release, U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcements officials requested they be notified about his release so they could take him into custody. In a subsequent tweet, Trump called out fellow Republican presidential hopeful Marco Rubio about border control, saying What do you say to the family of Kathryn Steinle in CA who was viciously killed b/c we cant secure our border? Stand up for US. Trump also tweeted a linked to a Washington Times story about the killing, following it up with We need a wall!, In recent weeks, several organizations and networks have cut ties with Trump after his comments on Mexican immigrants, among them NBC, which used to air the Miss USA pageant. However, the network recently announced it would no longer do so after it fired Trump. The pageant, co-owned by Trump, was later picked up by Reelz Channel. Hispanic leaders are bristling at the largely tepid response by Republican presidential candidates to Donald Trumps characterization of Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug dealers. Several 2016 contenders have brushed off Trumps comments while others have ignored them. Marco Rubio, a Florida senator who is Hispanic, denounced them as not just offensive and inaccurate, but also divisive, after declining for two weeks to address the matter directly. Another Hispanic in the race, Ted Cruz, said Trump is terrific, brash and speaks the truth. Its an uncomfortable moment for Republicans, who want more votes from the surging Latino population. And it could be a costly moment if more candidates dont go beyond their Donald-will-be-Donald response and condemn him directly, said Alfonso Aguilar, a Republican who leads the American Principles Projects Latino Partnership. The time has come for the candidates to distance themselves from Trump and call his comments what they are: ludicrous, baseless and insulting, Aguilar said. Sadly, it hurts the party with Hispanic voters. Its a level of idiocy I havent seen in a long time. So far, Trump has paid less of a political price than a commercial one. The leading Hispanic television network, Univision, has backed out of televising the Miss USA pageant, a joint venture between Trump and NBC, which also cut ties with Trump. On Wednesday, the Macys department store chain, which carried a Donald Trump menswear line, said it was ending its relationship with him. Other retailers are facing pressure to follow suit. In his speech last month marking his entry into the Republican race, Trump said Mexican immigrants are bringing drugs. Theyre bringing crime. Theyre rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. The businessman has refused to back down, although he insists his remarks were misconstrued. My statements have been contorted to seem racist and discriminatory, he wrote in a message to supporters on Thursday. What I want is for legal immigrants to not be unfairly punished because others are coming into America illegally, flooding the labor market and not paying taxes. His original comments, though, did not make a distinction between Mexicans who came to U.S. legally and those here illegally. His rhetoric may resonate with some of the Republican Partys most passionate voters, who have long viewed illegal immigration as one of the nations most pressing problems. But the 2016 contest brings opportunity for the party to make inroads with Hispanics, with several Latino candidates and a former Florida governor, Jeb Bush, who has deep Latino ties and speaks Spanish and hasnt been shy about using it in the campaign. Even so, Bush has said little more about Trumps comments than that they were wrong. Maybe well have a chance to have an honest discussion about it onstage, Bush said last weekend while campaigning in Nevada, referring to Republican presidential debates. Rev. Gabriel Salguero, president of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition, is paying keen attention to how the candidates respond to Trumps xenophobic rhetoric. Were listening very, very closely, not just what candidates say but what they dont say  the sins of commission and the sins of omission, he said. Among 2016 contenders:, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called Trumps comments wholly inappropriate. But in a subsequent radio interview, he said Trump is a really wonderful guy (whos) always been a good friend. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry said: I dont think Donald Trumps remarks reflect the Republican Party. Cruz said he likes Trump and thinks NBC is engaging in political correctness in breaking ties with him. Rubio said the next president needs to be someone who brings Americans together  not someone who continues to divide. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former technology executive Carly Fiorina and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson have been silent. Not since the 2004 re-election campaign of President George W. Bush has a Republican presidential candidate earned as much as 40 percent of the Hispanic vote. Mitt Romney got a dismal 27 percent in the 2012 contest against President Barack Obama.]", "Date": "20150703", "Title": "[Donald Trump uses San Francisco killing to slam illegal immigration]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/donald-trump-uses-san-francisco-killing-to-slam-illegal-immigration/", "Author": "[Seattle Times staff]"}

But local supporters of the Texas senator say hes planning a brief fundraising stop in the liberal city on Tuesday. Cruz will attend a $2,000-per-person fundraiser at the Washington Athletic Club in downtown Seattle, according to invitations circulated online in recent weeks. Virginia Schloredt, a local Cruz supporter organizing the fundraiser, said the Seattle event will run from 5 to 7 p.m. Tuesday, but declined to confirm the location, saying it is a private event. Steve Beren, spokesman for the Washington State Republican Party, said he heard the event was taking place downtown but had no additional information. The Cruz campaign did not confirm his visit or respond to multiple requests for comment. The Seattle stop was not listed on his campaigns public calendar, which shows him being in Wyoming on Wednesday. But Schloredt said she and other local Cruzers are thrilled to speak with the senator they view as a standout defender of liberty in the GOP field. About 70 people are expected to attend Tuesdays event. This will be the first chance I get to meet the man I adore like I do Ronald Reagan, said Schloredt, of Stanwood. Cruz wouldnt be the first presidential candidate to slip into the Seattle area to raise money quietly while avoiding public appearances. Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton and Republicans Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio each have made recent visits accessible only to big donors. Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders took a different approach for his Seattle stopover this month, appearing at two big public rallies  one of which was disrupted by Black Lives Matter protesters.

{"Content": "[ Sen. Ted Cruz, seemingly eyeing a presidential run in 2016, calls his renunciation of Canadian citizenship no big deal, even though questions about candidates birthplaces have flared in recent elections. Controversy still dogs President Barack Obama from some quarters despite proof he was born in Hawaii. Cruz, a Texas Republican and tea party favorite, was born in Canada, to a Cuban father and U.S.-born mother. His mothers status has allowed him to be a citizen of both the United States and Canada, but he said Tuesday in Houston, I believe it makes sense for me to be only an American. Previous foreign-born Americans  notably Republicans John McCain and George Romney  have run for president with some mention but no serious challenges of their eligibility. The chief upshot of Cruzs announcement that he will renounce his Canadian citizenship is to suggest hes seriously eyeing a presidential bid in 2016, and would like to settle that side issue now. Cruz is among Obamas sharpest critics, and is vying for early national attention with another tea party-backed Senate freshman, Rand Paul of Kentucky. Cruz is helping lead an effort to shut down the government if thats what it takes to stop implementation of Obamas landmark health care overhaul. While some birthers still challenge Obamas citizenship  and therefore his right to be president -his situation is different from Cruzs. The son of a Kenyan father and American mother, Obama was born in Hawaii, according to his birth certificate. Though birthers reject that evidence, many establishment Republicans saw that controversy as an unwelcome distraction in Obamas two elections, and the movement never expanded much beyond the partys fringes. At tea party events, Cruz has declined to be drawn into debates about Obamas birthplace, though he says the president has pushed relentlessly for European-style socialism in America. Cruz acknowledges being born in Calgary, Alberta, on Dec. 22, 1970. He says that after moving to Texas as a child, he never made an affirmative claim to dual citizenship, and hes now promising to drop his Canadian citizenship if in fact he holds it, The U.S. Constitution says only a natural born Citizen may be president. Legal scholars generally agree the description covers foreign-born children of U.S. parents. McCain, the 2008 Republican nominee, was born on a U.S. military base in the Panama Canal Zone. George Romney, a former Michigan governor who ran for president in 1968, was born in Mexico. His son, Mitt Romney, was the 2012 GOP nominee. Asked in a 2012 interview with The Associated Press whether he holds dual U.S. and Canadian citizenship, Cruz wouldnt answer directly, saying only: I am a U.S. citizen. Speaking Tuesday in Houston, Cruz said of questions about his birthplace and citizenship, This may be the silly season in politics. He said reporters recently suggested he holds dual citizenship and asked if he would renounce any Canadian citizenship. I say, sure, of course I would, Cruz said. Why? Because Im an American citizen by birth, and as a U.S. senator, I believe it makes sense for me to be only an American. In an earlier statement this week, Cruz said, When I was a kid, my mom told me that I could choose to claim Canadian citizenship if I wanted. I got my U.S. passport in high school. Having lived in the United States since age 4, Cruz said, and because I have never taken affirmative steps to claim Canadian citizenship, I assumed that was the end of the matter. , Will Weissert reported from Austin, Texas.]", "Date": "20130821", "Title": "[Sen.

{"Content": "[ Several million American workers will cut back their hours on the job or leave the nations workforce entirely because of President Barack Obamas health care overhaul, congressional analysts said Tuesday, adding fresh fuel to the political fight over Obamacare. The workforce changes would mean nationwide losses equal to 2.3 million full-time jobs by 2021, in large part because people would opt to keep their income low to stay eligible for federal health care subsidies or Medicaid, the Congressional Budget Office said. It had estimated previously that the law would lead to 800,000 fewer jobs by that year. Republican lawmakers seized on the report as major new evidence of what they consider the failures of Obamas overhaul, the huge change in U.S. health coverage that theyre trying to overturn and planning to use as a main argument against Democrats in Novembers midterm elections. Its the latest indication that the presidents health care law is destroying full-time jobs, said Republican Rep. John Kline of Minnesota, chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee. This fatally flawed health care scheme is wreaking havoc on working families nationwide, he said. But the White House said the possible reduction would be due to voluntary steps by workers rather than businesses cutting jobs  people having the freedom to retire early or spend more time as stay-at-home parents because they no longer had to depend only on their employers for health insurance. The law means people will be empowered to make choices about their own lives and livelihoods, said White House Press Secretary Jay Carney. CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf said the top reasons people would reduce work would be to qualify for subsidized coverage and an expanded Medicaid program but that lower wages  because of penalties on employers who dont provide coverage and looming taxes on generous health care plans  would also be a factor. The agency also reduced its estimate of the number of uninsured people who will get coverage through the health care law. The budget experts now say 1 million more people will be uninsured this year than had been expected, partly because of the website problems that prevented people from signing up last fall. However, it wasnt all bad news for the Obama administration. The CBOs wide-ranging report predicted that the federal budget deficit will fall to $514 billion this year, down from last years $680 billion and the lowest by far since Obama took office five years ago. The new estimates also say that the health care law will, in the short run, benefit the economy by boosting demand for goods and services because the lower-income people it helps will have more purchasing power. The report noted that the 2014 premiums that people pay for exchange coverage are coming in about 15 percent lower than projected, and the health care law, on balance, still is expected to reduce the federal deficit. However, the budget experts see the long-term federal deficit picture worsening by about $100 billion a year through the end of the decade because of slower growth in the economy than they had previously predicted. As for health care signups, the website woes have largely been cleared up, but the nonpartisan congressional analysts estimated that about 1 million fewer people will enroll through the new insurance exchanges than had been expected this year, for a total of 6 million. Enrollment is predicted to pick up, topping 20 million in 2016. The exchanges, or online marketplaces, offer subsidized private coverage and cater mainly to middle-class people who dont have health care on the job. The Congressional Budget Office also revised its Medicaid enrollment projection downward by about 1 million, for a new total of 8 million signups in 2014. About half the states have accepted the health laws Medicaid expansion. What about those people whose decisions about work might be affected by the new law?, Lower-wage workers are more likely to reduce their hours or quit their jobs because of Obamacare incentives, the report said. Although some employers will choose not to hire additional workers, or will reduce hours, the budget office said that does not appear to be the main factor. The estimated reduction stems almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that workers choose to supply, rather than from a net drop in businesses demand for labor, the report said. The health care analysis is layered with complexity. The job losses are measured in full-time-equivalent workers, which means more people are actually affected than, say, the 2 million full-time-equivalent jobs lost in 2017. It could take several part-time workers or people deciding to reduce their hours to produce the wage loss of one full-time equivalent. The report also contains an important caveat, that the estimate of job losses is subject to substantial uncertainty and could be larger or smaller than predicted. There now are more than 130 million jobs in the economy. Meanwhile, the broad federal deficit projection shows another yearly improvement. Obama inherited an economy in crisis and the first deficits ever to exceed $1 trillion. The 2009 total, swelled by the costs of the Wall Street bailout, hit a record $1.4 trillion, while the deficits of 2010 and 2011 each registered $1.3 trillion. The agency sees the deficit sliding to $478 billion next year before beginning a steady rise years through 2024 that would bring the annual imbalance back above $1 trillion. Overall, it forecasts deficits totaling $7.3 trillion over the coming decade, about $1 trillion more than previously estimated. CBO expects that economic growth will diminish to a pace that is well below the average seen over the past several decades, the report said, citing an aging population and a decrease in the rate of growth in the labor force. Tuesdays report comes as Obama and Republicans in Congress are taking a respite in the budget wars that have periodically consumed Washington since Republicans took control of the House in 2011. The declining deficit numbers mean they could feel even less urgency to act now. A December budget agreement and last months follow-up spending bill could buy peace through Novembers midterm elections. Republicans also appear to be taking a less confrontational approach to legislation needed this month to increase the governments borrowing limit to avoid defaulting on its obligations.]", "Date": "20140204", "Title": "[Obamacare may prompt millions to work less]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/obamacare-may-prompt-millions-to-work-less/", "Author": "[RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR, ANDREW TAYLOR]"}
{"Content": "[ Shedding any pretense of civility and party unity, Donald Trump overwhelmed the first Republican presidential debate on Thursday night by ripping into his rivals and the moderators alike  but also drew fire from Jeb Bush and other candidates who are seeking to stop Trumps surge. Trump displayed his trademark pugnacity from the start with a bravura moment: refusing to rule out a third-party run for the presidency if he does not win the GOP nomination. Facing loud boos from audience members in a Cleveland sports arena, he held his hand up in defiance as several other Republicans looked flabbergasted. I have to respect the person that, if its not me, the person that wins, said Trump, the billionaire businessman and reality-TV star who has attracted legions of fans, in part by attacking traditional politicians such as Bush, who Trump has said should not be president. He then quipped: If Im the nominee, I will pledge I will not run as an independent. In the first of several freewheeling moments, Trumps statement drew an instant, contemptuous retort from Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who nodded to Trumps past donations to former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. He buys and sells politicians of all stripes, Paul said. So if he doesnt run as a Republican, maybe he supports Clinton, or maybe he runs as an independent?, Trump  whose withering put-downs have become legendary, his favorite pejorative being loser  was true to form in dismissing Paul. Well, Ive given him plenty of money, he said. Trumps outsize presence in the two-hour debate, shown on Fox News, was an emphatic reminder that Republicans quest to regain the presidency will be complicated by their own internal divisions. In addition to refusing to rule out a third-party bid and sparring with the Fox News moderators, Trump boasted that the Clintons attended his third wedding because he demanded it and said: Our politicians are stupid, while dismissing President George W. Bushs tenure as a catastrophe. Even as some of the other Republicans showed moments of strength, it was little match for the bombast of Trump. Establishment-oriented Republicans had hoped that two terms of President Obama would make grass-roots activists pragmatic about 2016, perhaps rallying around a well-known, well-financed candidate such as Jeb Bush. But the popularity of Trumps message suggested the party was just as interested in finding a pugilist. Trump and Bush, who have been lashing out at each other for weeks, barely tangled. But near the end of the debate, Bush said Trump  who has portrayed some Mexican immigrants as rapists  was a divisive figure who would ensure that Republicans continued to lose. I want to win, Bush said. Were not going to win by doing what Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton do each and every day: dividing the country  Were going to win when we unite people with a hopeful optimistic message. Trump shot back that the threats against the U.S. were too urgent for such concerns about tone. When you have people that are cutting Christians heads off, when you have a world at the border and at so many places that, its medieval times, Trump said. We dont have time for tone; we have to go out and get the job done. The exchange of fire between Trump and Bush  the dominant figures in the race and two American household names  offered a preview of the broader debate to come between Republicans who believe the party must be more inclusive to regain the presidency and those determined to speak to the boiling anger in the conservative grass roots. Few of the fights were over policy, however: Trump, for one, offered few substantive details about his plans for the country. The Fox News moderators, delving into the records of the 10 candidates, posed a series of difficult questions, while also trying, with occasional success, to provoke arguments among them over areas of disagreement. In the first question directly to Trump, for instance, Megyn Kelly cited his negative comments about some women, whom he has called fat pigs and slobs, before Trump cut her off. Only Rosie ODonnell, he said, looking for a laugh. For the record, it was well beyond Rosie ODonnell, Kelly said. Yes, Im sure it was, Trump replied, before offering an explanation. I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct, he said. I dont frankly have time for total political correctness. And to be honest with you, this country doesnt have time, either. He went on to complain about rough treatment by Kelly. As the night went on, occasional alliances appeared to form among certain candidates, intentionally or not. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio each flattered Trump by saying he had hit a nerve with his tough talk about illegal immigration and other problems facing the United States. Trump and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey took turns belittling Paul, who has been struggling in polls and fundraising, and who kept on the attack against Trump and other rivals throughout the debate. In the sharpest exchange between candidates, Paul and Christie, who have traded shots over national security for more than two years, exchanged personal insults over surveillance and civil liberties. After Paul said he only wanted to seek the personal data of terrorists, not average citizens, Christie called that a completely ridiculous answer and went further. When youre sitting in a subcommittee just blowing hot air about this, you can say things like that, Christie said. , Paul, his voice rising, said Christie misunderstood the Bill of Rights and then offered his own stinging rejoinder. I dont trust President Obama with our records, said Paul, before lowering the boom with a reference to the embrace between Obama and Christie after Hurricane Sandy in 2012, a moment that still haunts Christie with conservatives: I know you gave him a big hug. Boos and cheers from the audience quickly enveloped the exchange onstage. Christie, seemingly ready for the attack, shot back that the hugs he recalled were with the families who lost their people on Sept. 11. The moderators tried to incite a confrontation between Bush and Rubio, who were once allies in Florida politics but now hope to bury each others candidacies in the March primary there, pressing them over Bushs support for the Common Core education standards. But Rubio went to higher ground and discussed school reform without disparaging Bush, one of several moments he struck a positive tone about his fellow Republicans. Rubio did go on the offensive against Clinton, the leading Democratic presidential candidate, painting her as out of touch with the financial struggles of many Americans. If Im our nominee, how is Hillary Clinton going to lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck? Rubio asked. I was raised paycheck to paycheck. Later, he expanded on the hit: God has blessed the Republican Party with some very good candidates, he said. The Democrats cant even find one. Other debate participants demonstrated why many in the party believe they have one of the best presidential fields in decades. Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin appeared fluent on policy and emerged untouched by his rivals. And Kasich won repeated applause from the home-state crowd, and with his heartfelt talk suggested he could be a threat to Bush among right-of-center Republicans.]", "Date": "20150806", "Title": "[Trump starts with stunner  and keeps on shocking]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/trump-starts-with-stunner-and-keeps-on-shocking/", "Author": "[Patrick Healy]"}

Thanks to a 2013 ballot measure, seven of nine Seattle City Council members will be elected this year by geographic district. Two will be elected citywide. Two of the councils current members arent running for re-election, and a third left for another job earlier this year, so two district seats and a citywide position are wide open and have attracted 23 candidates among them. Five races feature current council members  Bruce Harrell, Sally Bagshaw, Jean Godden, Kshama Sawant and Mike OBrien  trying to fend off challengers in newly drawn districts. Current Council President Tim Burgess is attempting to hold on to a citywide seat. The move to district voting is, according to some, responsible for a primary-election ballot with a larger, more diverse crop of candidates than usual, including many younger hopefuls, women and people of color. Though candidates have been campaigning for months, money raised from business groups and labor unions by independent-expenditure committees only just began pouring into the races. The committees have spent more than $275,000 already. Seattles housing-affordability challenges and debate over increased housing density in the city have recently assumed center stage in the contests. The top two candidates in each race will advance to the general election. Courtney Gregoire, seeking re-election to Position 2 on the Port of Seattle Commission, has two opponents  perennial candidate Goodspaceguy and John Naubert, a socialist electrical-wire assembler who also ran in 2013 and 2011. Nine candidates are fighting over the seat Bryant is vacating, including the former president of the company that operates the Victoria Clipper, a former Delta Air Lines board member, a railroad-union leader, a marine environmental consultant and a former Normandy Park City Council member. Campaign matters include creating family-wage jobs, expanding Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, forming a seaport alliance with the Port of Tacoma, and Terminal 5 serving as a home for Shell Oils Arctic drilling fleet. In the Seattle School Boards District 3, which includes parts of Northeast Seattle and downtown, a field of four will be winnowed down to two. The candidates are Jill Geary, Lauren McGuire, Stephen Clayton and David Blomstrom, and easing crowding in school buildings has been a point of focus. Harium Martin-Morris, who currently represents District 3, isnt running again. In District 6, incumbent Marty McLaren is taking on two challengers, Leslie Harris and Nick Esparza. Two other seats have only two candidates, each of whom will automatically proceed to the general election. Managing growth and the coming light-rail line have been the hot topics in two Bellevue City Council races. Three candidates want to replace Mayor Claudia Balducci, whos leaving her District 5 seat in Bellevue to run for Metropolitan King County Council. Balducci has endorsed two of the hopefuls  journalist and community volunteer Sherry Grindeland and biotechnology professional Vandana Slatter. The third candidate is Michelle Hilhorst, an IT operations manager with the races best rating from the Municipal League of King County. Position 7 incumbent Jennifer Robertson, a land-use attorney, is defending her seat against bicycling and neighborhood advocate Lyndon Heywood and anti-light-rail candidate Bill Hirt. The League rated Hirt not qualified. Two candidates for Position 3, including incumbent John Chelminiak, will advance to the general election, and incumbent John Stokes is running unopposed for Position 1. Snohomish County Executive John Lovick, whom the Snohomish County Council appointed to replace Aaron Reardon in 2013 after a scandal, is up against County Council Chairman Dave Somers and three others. Lovick and Somers, who have sparred openly over the past year about county finances and management, are both Democrats. Somers has called Lovick a terrible manager responsible for ballooning cost estimates on a planned new courthouse and other issues. Lovick has said the county is growing and prospering under his leadership, citing an unemployment rate of 4 percent. Two Republicans, retired biochemist Robert Sutherland and Marysville farmer Norm Nunnally, also are running, along with Lynnwood attorney James Robert Deal, who states no party preference.

{"Content": "[ Sometimes the most life-changing events come out of the most ordinary moments. And so it was when Michael Medved, a nationally syndicated, conservative radio host, was getting his teeth cleaned last December. The dental hygienist noticed a lump in the back of his throat. The dentist took a look and thought it might be a swollen lymph gland. Chances are, its nothing, he told Medved. But go see an ear, nose and throat guy. Medved did, and that doctor did a CT scan right there, with a medical student tagging along. They left, and a little while later, came back in. You have cancer, the doctor told Medved. The student burst into tears. And Medved, 66, a respected voice of conservative America was, quite suddenly, speechless. It was so out of the blue, Medved said the other day of his stage 3 throat cancer. After four months of almost daily radiation and weekly chemotherapy treatments, he is cancer-free and  as of April 21  back on the air at Seattles KTTH 770-AM, where his weekday show is broadcast. Medved is syndicated through the Salem Radio Network and reaches almost 5 million listeners a week. On Medveds first day back, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush came in  the only Seattle media he did before a fundraiser that night. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal called in to wish Medved well. So did Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan. (Paul went on for a while. He is one of the nicest people in politics.), All have a stake in the GOPs showing in the upcoming presidential election  and are surely relieved to have Medved back on the air. I worked my whole life to be part of the national conversation, he said. And at the start of an election?, There are those who are sorry to see him return to the airwaves  and told him so. One commenter said, I wish the cancer had killed you, a line Medved mentioned more than once as I drove him home from the station the other day. I didnt recognize him at first; hes lost 41 pounds and wears a baseball hat to cover the fact that his full head of hair has turned to fuzz. Hes not allowed to drive because of the medication hes taking, so he climbed into my car and took in the ukulele-playing, shorts-wearing Barack Obama figure stuck to my dashboard. I picked it up in Hawaii, I told him. Its a conversation starter, Medved said. Neither of us mentioned it again. At his Eastside home, Medveds wife, Diane, had put out a plate of apples and cheese  but not for her husband, who hooked up a feeding machine he carries in a small backpack. His taste buds are zapped, he said, and the sides of his mouth sore from the radiation. He is looking forward to solid food like his wifes salmon with tarragon and maybe a kosher pizza. But hes also hungry to divine the future of the country. The presidential candidates. And the issues, including health care. Medved is on Sound Path, a supplement of Medicare. Just for the record. Im very impatient with people who say Obamacare has wrecked our medical-care system, he said. Thats insulting to doctors and medical staff. Its operating well, and its a system that cared for me. My experience will inform everything I talk about from here on out. Medved started cancer treatment Jan. 5 and decided to work through it. He only told his producer, Jeremy Steiner, and the general manager of the Bonneville Radio offices in Seattle. On Jan. 25, when he was invited to speak at The Roanoke Conference, a conservative group, on the Washington coast,his wife drove him, fixed his hair to cover up the parts lost to radiation and waited anxiously while he spoke (with both hands firmly holding the sides of the podium) and signed books. On their way across the parking lot to their hotel room, Medved fell into a puddle. That was it. The next Friday, he told the people at the station what was going on, and posted A Personal Note to My Radio Family on his website, explaining what was going on. (Within an hour, 25,000 people posted comments.), Then he signed off for more than two months and faced his cancer. (Colleague David Boze, a prince of a guy, filled in the noon to 3 p.m. slot), along with others. Had my voice sustained it, I would have tried to keep going longer, he said. Asked how his cancer experience changed him, Medved borrowed from a quote often attributed to Coach Vince Lombardi, but that actually came from UCLA Bruins Coach Henry Russell Red Sanders: Winning isnt everything; its the only thing. For me, its Family isnt everything; its the only thing,  he said. It just reminds you. His wife is like the sun coming up. His two daughters and son were loving and attentive. His new daughter-in-law, Richelle, is about to graduate from nursing school, and used all her skills to help him. It makes you realize how precious the little things are, he said. Waking up in your own bed. Food. And theres plenty to chew on, now that candidates are announcing for 2016  Medved has counted as many as 20 in the Republican Party alone. Its such a messy race, Medved said. He attended Yale Law School with Hillary Rodham Clinton and doesnt agree with the conservative portrayal of her as a wicked witch. I just think shes wrong on the issues. The election should go to the candidate who shows the best path for the country. Not the one who is the biggest bastard, Medved said of todays acrimonious political climate. If it is Hillary versus Jeb, theyre both better than that, and highly capable of arguing on an constructive and patriotic level. For now, Medved is back working on his 14th book, Gods Hand on America: The Case for Divine Providence in U.S. History, for which his publisher, Random House, gave him an extension. He has cut back from three or four movie reviews a week to just two. And hes back on the air, booking guests like John McCain and Rand Paul. Its the right time for me to come back, he said. I have strong feelings about the election. But mostly, I hope this is an uplifting election for the country. It is already that for Medved: He is here to see it.]", "Date": "20150501", "Title": "[Michael Medved: Beating cancer will inform everything I talk about from here on out]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/life/michael-medved-beating-cancer-will-inform-everything-i-talk-about-from-here-on-out/", "Author": "[NULL]"}
{"Content": "[ Spurning furious Republicans, President Barack Obama unveiled expansive executive actions on immigration Thursday night to spare nearly 5 million people in the U.S. illegally from deportation and refocus enforcement efforts on felons, not families. The moves, affecting mostly parents and young people, marked the most sweeping changes to the nations fractured immigration laws in nearly three decades and set off a fierce fight with Republicans over the limits of presidential powers. In a televised address to the nation, Obama defended the legality of his actions and challenged GOP lawmakers to focus their energy not on blocking his measures but on approving long-stalled legislation to take their place. To those members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed, I have one answer: Pass a bill, Obama said, flexing his presidential powers just two weeks after his political standing was challenged in the midterm elections. As Obama spoke from the White House, immigration supporters with American flags draped over their shoulders marched on Pennsylvania Avenue outside carrying signs that read, Gracias, Presidente Obama. The address marked the first step in the White House effort to promote the executive actions to the public. On Friday, Obama will speak at a campaign-style rally in Las Vegas. Despite Obamas challenge to Republicans to pass a broader immigration bill, his actions and the angry GOP response could largely stamp out those prospects for the remainder of his presidency, ensuring that the contentious debate will carry on into the 2016 elections. Republicans, emboldened by their sweeping victories in the midterms, are weighing responses to the presidents actions that include lawsuits, a government shutdown and in rare instances, even impeachment. The president will come to regret the chapter history writes if he does move forward, Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who is soon to become the Senate majority leader, said before Obamas address. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who has refused to have his members vote on broad immigration legislation passed by the Senate last year, said Obamas decision to go it alone cemented his legacy of lawlessness and squandered what little credibility he had left. While Obamas measures are sweeping in scope, they still leave more than half of the 11 million people living in the U.S. illegally in limbo. The president announced new deportation priorities that would compel law enforcement to focus its efforts on tracking down serious criminals and people who have recently crossed the border, while specifically placing a low priority on those who have been in the United States for more than 10 years. The president spent months trying to gain a House vote on the Senate bill, frustrating immigration advocates and some Democrats who wanted him to instead take action on his own. While Obama had long insisted that his powers to halt deportations were limited, the White House began seriously exploring options for unilateral action. Still, that process has been beset by delays, especially Obamas decision to hold off on announcing the executive orders until after the midterms. Some Democrats had feared that thrusting the immigration debate to the forefront of the campaign would hurt their chances of keeping control of the Senate, though the White Houses delay ultimately did little to stem their defeats. Obama insisted that his actions did not amount to amnesty. Amnesty is the immigration system we have today  millions of people who live here without paying their taxes or playing by the rules, while politicians use the issue to scare people and whip up votes at election time, he said. The main beneficiaries of the presidents actions are immigrants who have been in the U.S. illegally for more than five years but whose children are citizens or lawful permanent residents. After passing background checks and paying fees, those individuals will soon be able to seek relief from deportation and get work permits. The administration expects about 4.1 million people to qualify. Obama is also broadening his 2012 directive that deferred deportation for some young immigrants who entered the country illegally. Obama will expand eligibility to people who arrived in the U.S. as minors before 2010, instead of the current cutoff of 2007, and will lift the requirement that applicants be under 31. The expansion is expected to affect about 300,000 people. Applications for the new deportation deferrals will begin in the spring. Those who qualify would be granted deferrals for three years at a time. Immigration-rights activists gathered at watch parties around the country to listen to the president announce actions they have sought for years. This is a great day for farmworkers. Its been worth the pain and sacrifice, said Jesus Zuniga, a 40-year-old who picks tomatoes in Californias Central Valley and watched the speech at a union gathering in Fresno. In New York City, however, a couple of protesters held no amnesty signs outside a New York union office where advocates of the presidents plan were gathering to watch him and celebrate. We have a lot of unemployed Americans right now, and I dont understand why unemployed Americans cant be hired to do the jobs these illegals are doing, said John Wilson, who works in contract management. The White House insists Obama has the legal authority to halt deportations for parents and for people who came to the U.S. as children, primarily on humanitarian grounds. Officials also cited precedents set by previous immigration executive actions by Democratic and Republican presidents dating back to Dwight Eisenhower. A senior administration official said the decision to protect parents of citizens or lawful permanent residents is in line with an existing law that allows adult citizens to sponsor their parents for immigration. Obamas plan goes a step further because the sponsoring citizen doesnt have to be an adult. GOP lawmakers disagree with Obamas claims of legal authority, calling his actions an unconstitutional power grab. Republicans are weighing a range of responses, including filing legal challenges and using must-pass spending legislation this fall to try to stop Obamas effort. One lawmaker  Republican Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama  has raised the specter of impeachment. GOP leaders have warned against such talk and are seeking to avoid spending-bill tactics that could lead to a government shutdown. They say such moves could backfire, angering many voters and alienating Hispanics for the next presidential election.

{"Content": "[ ST. LOUIS (AP)  A growing divide has emerged in the Republican Partys unruly presidential contest, as the race bid farewell to a once-powerful White House contender. On one side stands billionaire businessman Donald Trump and his allies, on the other are those who oppose him. A day after Rick Perry, Texas longest-serving governor, ended his second Republican presidential run with a whimper, Trump marked the shake-up by embracing his role as his partys 2016 bully on Saturday. Mr. Perry, hes gone. Good luck. He was very nasty to me, Trump told Iowa voters. Turning to rival Ben Carson, he questioned whether the retired neurosurgeon had the energy to negotiate successfully with world leaders. In an interview earlier, Trump touted his tough-talking style as a plus. Rick Perry first to exit 2016 Republican presidential race, Schwarzenegger takes over for Trump on Apprentice, Its an attitude that our country needs. We get pushed around by everybody, he told Fox News, adding, We have to push back. Perry had all but declared war on the billionaire businessman in July, calling Trump a cancer on conservatism who could destroy the Republican Party. On Saturday, Trumps campaign was soaring while Perrys White House ambitions were dead. And with the real estate mogul suffocating the rest of the packed field, its likely a matter of time before he helps push another GOP candidate out of the race. Perry was a leading voice in the anti-Trump movement, a group that has suffered in the polls as Trumps public allies largely avoid backlash from the anti-insider wave that made Trump the unlikeliest of Republican presidential front-runners. There is no play in the playbook for where we are right now, said John Jordan, a California winery owner and major Republican fundraiser. Donors dont know what to think. Nobody saw the Trump phenomenon coming. In still-early polls, the real-estate mogul and reality TV star has more support that the once-top-tier trio of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio combined. In second, by the way, is another political rookie: Carson, who repeatedly refused to criticize Trump in recent days. Bush has gone the other way in recent weeks, jabbing the businessman repeatedly on the campaign trail and through social media. He was at it again Saturday while meeting with supporters in Miami. Mr. Trump says that I cant speak Spanish, Bush told the crowd in Spanish. Pobrecito (poor guy). Walker, another Trump critic, has also struggled recently, particularly in Iowa, where he was considered a front-runner for much of the year. The Wisconsin governor canceled upcoming appearances in California and Michigan to focus instead on the critical early voting Iowa and South Carolina. Nothing changed for us aside from some scheduling, Walker spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said, dismissing any suggestion the campaign was concerned. On the other end of the spectrum, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, perhaps Trumps biggest ally, declined to address the Trump effect on Perrys exit on Saturday. I recognize that the media enjoys seeing Republicans bicker back and forth with each other and throw rocks at each other. But I think the American people could not care less, Cruz told reporters after addressing the same gathering of social conservatives in St. Louis that Perry shocked the night before with his announcement. A tea party favorite, Cruz has declined to seize on Trumps positions that would normally trigger conservative ire. Trump favors tax increases on the rich, once supported abortion rights, gave money to Hillary Rodham Clinton and said kind things about government-run health care in other countries. Someone has to bring him down.  Im not going to sit quietly by and let the disaster that is Donald Trump become the nominee, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul told The Associated Press. Do you want someone who appears to still be in grade school to be in charge of the nuclear arsenal?, Meanwhile, Perrys allies at three well-funded super PACs found they couldnt share the money theyve raised or coordinate their activities with his campaign. Austin Barbour, a leader of the pro-Perry super PACs, said the groups have as much as $13 million in the bank. He planned to talk with lawyers to see what the law says we can do with this money. Perrys Republican rivals praised him publicly and privately  and began courting his political network. Cruz on Saturday said Perry did a remarkable job as governor and praised him for running an honorable campaign. A person close to the Cruz campaign, who was not authorized to speak publicly and requested anonymity, says the fellow Texans camp will be immediately reaching out to Perry donors and supporters. If we dont jump in, other campaigns are going to try to, the person said.

{"Content": "[ ST. LOUIS (AP)  Out of money and relegated once again to the back-of-the-pack debate, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry on Friday dropped out of the race for president, ending his second bid for the Republican presidential nomination and becoming the first major candidate of the 2016 campaign to give up on the White House. The longest-serving governor in Texas history, who had never lost an election until he started running for president, told a group of conservative activists in St. Louis that some things have become clear and that it was time to suspend his campaign. We have a tremendous field of candidates  probably the greatest group of men and women, Perry said. I step aside knowing our party is in good hands, as long as we listen to the grassroots, listen to that cause of conservatism. If we do that, then our party will be in good hands. Four years ago, Perrys first bid for the White House essentially collapsed after a GOP debate in which he couldnt remember the name of the third federal agency hed wanted to close if elected  he was only able to mutter Oops. This time around, he couldnt win enough support in early polls to even qualify for the partys prime-time debates, finding himself relegated instead to second-stage affairs. After formally kicking off his bid in early June, Perry announced raising about $1 million during the first month of his campaign. That wasnt enough to keep the small staffs he had assembled in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, as well as at his headquarters in Texas, on the payroll. While some members of Perrys team pledged to work as volunteers, and he resumed paying some late last month, he ultimately couldnt recover from the lack of campaign cash. Itd be easy just to keep going, be easy to go do the debate next week, be easy to keep going to Iowa and South Carolina and other states and everything and taking your money and dragging it out, said Dallas businessman and longtime Perry donor Roy Bailey. But, Bailey said, Perry could see it was pretty obvious to him he wasnt going to be the next presidential nominee from the Republican Party. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who took the stage at the Eagle Forum conference in St. Louis immediately after Perry announced his exit, called on the crowd to pray for Perrys future success. The only thing harder than to get into a race for something like president, is to make the decision to get out of the race, said Huckabee, the runner-up for the GOP nomination in 2008. And I hope that all of you will recognize that it was a very difficult decision. Ive been there before. Perry spent four years after his failed bid in 2012, which ended after disappointing finishes in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, trying to rebuild his image and convince America hed lived down Oops. He swapped his cowboy boots for eyeglasses, traveled extensively touting his states job-creating prowess and huddled with policy experts and top donors, insisting hed be humbler and better-prepared for the national spotlight when running again in 2016. He staked his strategy this time around on Iowa, visiting the first-to-vote state repeatedly over the past three months, showing off strong one-on-one campaigning skills and country charm honed after decades in Texas politics. But it wasnt enough to push him into the top 10 of the GOPs unwieldy field of candidates, which meant he wasnt on stage last month at the first prime-time debate of the campaign. While delivered a stronger performance at the pre-debate forum than he did during the debates four years ago, few noticed in a 2016 GOP campaign dominated to date by billionaire Donald Trump  who stole away Perrys Iowa campaign chairman after Perry was forced to suspend paying members of his staff. While the ultimate accuracy of polls taken months before voters cast their ballots is notoriously poor, they are nonetheless being used in this campaign to pick who can take part in the GOP debates. Hovering around 1 percent, Perry was again set to miss out on the main event at next weeks debate at the Reagan Library outside Los Angeles. On Thursday night, Perry called Bailey to say he was out. He was very matter of fact, he was confident in his decision, Bailey said. He hated it, because hes such a competitive person, that thats what it came down to. Hell take a breather and jump back into life out of politics. Amid Perrys money problems, a group of super PACs largely funded by three big Perry backers had kept Perry afloat by raising $17 million and hiring their own Iowa staff and producing television and digital ads and mailers. His decision Friday came as a surprise to those groups, which are barred from communicating directly with the campaign. A pro-Perry super PAC emailed its supporters Friday morning saying it was back on television in Iowa to promote his candidacy. A Twitter message from the group sent later in the morning further emphasized, In It For the Long Haul. The decisions of a candidate to get into, or out of, a campaign of this magnitude are intensely personal, family decisions, said Ray Sullivan, the co-chair of one of the pro-Perry super PACs. The campaigns cash position matters, your poll numbers matter, but those things are surmountable if the candidate and his family are willing to stick it out even against seemingly long odds.

{"Content": "[ TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP)  Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou proposed a plan Tuesday to ease tensions in a vast, resource-rich Asian ocean where China has chafed against its neighbors by using landfill to expand islets to solidify its claims in the region. Mas plan calls for setting aside sovereignty disputes over the South China Sea and jointly exploring for resources. Taiwan has not been a high-profile player in the disputes in the South China Sea, although it uses roughly the same historical basis for its claim as China, and Mas initiative appeared aimed at shoring up foreign policy credentials at home. We emphasize that whereas sovereignty cant be divided, resources can be shared, Ma said in a speech Tuesday at an Asia-Pacific research forum in Taipei. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Beijing has noted Mas proposal, but offered no opinion as to its feasibility. We believe that Chinese people across the strait are obliged to together maintain Chinas territorial integrity and maritime rights, and the peace and stability in the South China Sea, Hua told a regular briefing. Taiwan, China, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines claim all or parts of the 3.5 million-square kilometer (1.4 million-square mile) South China Sea. The ocean ranges from Taiwans southern tip southwest to Singapore. In recent months China has made other claimants and their common ally the United States bristle by using landfill to form new islands, a way to extend its reach. The tropical sea is rich in oil, natural gas and fisheries and is crossed by major shipping routes. In a sign of recent tensions, Beijing filed a formal complaint with the United States this week after an American military plane flew over one islet, and Japan pledged to help Vietnam and the Philippines with defense as Chinas presence grows. Taiwans initiative calls on all parties concerned to uphold the freedom and safety of navigation and overflight and avoid unilateral action that would escalate tension, according to a statement from the foreign ministry. It also suggests regional cooperation in developing the regions resources. Other South China Sea claimants are unlikely to react openly to Taiwans initiative as they lack diplomatic relations with Mas government. China claims sovereignty over Taiwan and uses its economic clout to bar other nations from exchanges that cast Taiwan as a nation. Ma did not discuss Tuesday the basis for Taiwans maritime claim or that of other governments. The United States wants the sea to remain open to shipping and flights, while Beijing has said Washington wants to keep a presence there to contain Chinese maritime expansion. Taiwan is eager to get along with the United States as its staunchest informal ally. Mas initiative is not enough for China and its not enough for the United States, so you just end up not meeting everyones expectations, said Lai I-chung, vice president of Taiwan Think Tank. The peace plan may also be calculated to bolster Taiwans ruling Nationalist Party ahead of a January 2016 presidential election as the chief opposition candidate develops a competing plan for the South China Sea, said Joanna Lei, chief executive officer of the Chunghua 21st Century Think Tank in Taiwan. Ma has been criticized at home for lack of foreign policy achievements. In 2012, Ma proposed a peace initiative for settling disputes in the East China Sea, parts of which are claimed by his government as well as China and Japan.]", "Date": "20150526", "Title": "[Taiwan proposes plan to ease South China Sea tensions]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/taiwan-proposes-plan-to-ease-south-china-sea-tensions/", "Author": "[RALPH JENNINGS]"}
{"Content": "[ TEHRAN, Iran (AP)  Irans former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has launched a political campaign ahead of Februarys parliamentary elections in what could prove a challenge to the moderates behind a landmark nuclear agreement reached last month. Few expect a rerun of Ahmadinejads surprise victory in the 2005 elections, which kicked off an eight-year presidency marked by confrontation with the West, incendiary rhetoric toward Israel and refusal to compromise on the disputed nuclear program. Many former allies have turned on Ahmadinejad, and two of his former vice presidents have been jailed for corruption. But the unapologetic populist is believed to command strong support in the countryside, and could be seen by Irans Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as a counterbalance to the reformers who have tried to reverse Ahmadinejads confrontational legacy since the election of President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate, two years ago. At a gathering of his supporters Thursday, Ahmadinejad, 58, broke two years of silence, vowing to redefine revolutionary ideals laid out by the leader of Irans 1979 revolution, the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. God willing, victory and a very bright future awaits us. However, there will be bumps and satanic obstacles in our path, the diminutive former leader, sporting his trademark close-cropped beard and sports coat, told some 400 supporters in Tehran. One should not forget that the U.S. is our enemy. He called on his supporters to begin working energetically in the provinces. He remains popular among the rural poor because of his governments decision to provide monthly cash handouts after cutting food and energy subsidies, and because of his condemnation of capitalism and injustice. During his presidency he received thousands of letters a day from ordinary Iranians, and earlier this week people lined up outside his Tehran residence to ask for assistance, a reflection of his populist touch. But many middle and upper class Iranians, even in small towns, blame the crippling international sanctions over Irans nuclear program on his bombastic anti-Western rhetoric. And the current government is in the process of removing millions of wealthy citizens from the welfare rolls to ease a budget crisis caused in part by the sanctions and plunging oil prices. Ahmadinejad has not commented on the nuclear deal, which would lift painful international sanctions in return for Iran curbing its nuclear activities. He could do little to derail the agreement, particularly if it enjoys the support of the supreme leader. But a strong showing by Ahmadinejads supporters in Februarys election could hinder any push for a broader rapprochement between Iran and the United States, and lay the groundwork for his return to the presidency. Former Deputy Foreign Minister Sadeq Kharrazi, a reformist politician, said Ahmadinejads political career is over but that Ahmadinejadism  his unique melding of economic populism with a hawkish foreign policy  remains a threat to the country. In the absence of reliable polling, its impossible to gauge Ahmadinejads level of support. Any comeback would depend on Khamenei, who along with his hand-picked appointees vets candidates for parliamentary and presidential elections. The key is the ruling systems decision on how to deal with Ahmadinejad, political analyst Saeed Leilaz said. He cant reappear without approval from the top echelons of power, he added. His comeback means Khamenei wants to use him as a counterbalance to control reformists in the upcoming elections. The unprecedented nuclear deal has bolstered Rouhani and Irans moderate camp. Leilaz said the ruling system hopes parliamentary elections will slow its rise by dividing the seats more or less equally among moderates, conservatives and hard-liners. Conservatives fear that the moderates will open the country to an influx of Western culture that would dilute its Islamic values. Hard-liners fear that the nuclear deal will lead to a broader rapprochement with the United States, which they still view as a Great Satan, determined to dismantle the Islamic republic. Many conservatives and hard-liners turned on Ahmadinejad in the latter years of his rule, but they could come to see him as a much-needed ally, fearing a repeat of the landslide victory in the 2000 elections by reformists committed to transforming the Islamic republic into a Western-style democracy. Conservative lawmaker Gholam Ali Haddad Adel, whose daughter is married to Khameneis son, said the moderates are more interested in bringing back McDonalds restaurants than in countering the U.S.-backed and Saudi-led air campaign against Shiite rebels in Yemen. Unfortunately, some are embracing America and opening their arms to American companies, he said. No one could accuse Ahmadinejad of being soft on America, but he was widely blamed for the economic crisis that emerged near the end of his rule after tough international sanctions were imposed in 2012. After he stepped down the following year, even hard-line media outlets said he should be held accountable for his administrations mismanagement of the economy. The Javan newspaper called on him to apologize to Iranians on national TV, and the weekly Yalesarat said he should stand trial as a lesson to others. But, Mehrdad Khadir, a journalist for a moderate newspaper, said Ahmadinejad and his allies could win a minority of seats in Februarys elections, and with Khameneis support he could seek the presidency in 2017. The lower classes, who are easily attracted with simple slogans, might still like Ahmadinejads style, even if they dont necessarily favor him in person, he said. If (the supreme leader) feels that Ahmadinejads running for an election can create enthusiasm and a heated competition, he will welcome it, provided that (Ahmadinejad) is not linked to the financial scandal cases.

{"Content": "[ The abortion battle has long been laden with symbolic images. On Friday morning, the House voted to block Planned Parenthoods federal funds for a year so it could investigate claims of the groups wrongdoing. The alleged wrongdoing went viral in videos with headlines such as Planned Parenthood Uses Partial-Birth Abortions to Sell Baby Parts, (viewed 3million times). The agency said the video was edited to make it appear laws were broken. The videos were a major part of this weeks GOP presidential debate. Fridays vote had been along party lines, and the symbolism included a poster-sized photo of a scarred, aborted fetus. Conservatives threatened a government shutdown if the funding isnt cut off. On Friday morning at the Seattle headquarters of Planned Parenthood, it was the other sides turn for symbolism. Fifty young women, many in pink T-shirts, surrounded Sen. Patty Murray. The women carried signs, also pink, that said, Dont take away our care. Murray talked about this Tea Party tantrum in prepared comments not dissimilar from previous ones shes made on the issue. She was standing in the lobby of the centers offices on East Madison Street, 2,100 miles from the Texas State Capitol in Austin. Texas already has stripped the agency of most government funding, state or federal. The symbolism at the womens health center on East Madison Street included 25-year-old Justis Phillips. Shes a cloud-computing project manager, and later admitted that at first she was nervous talking so personally. But, she said, I have a theater background and I like to command a room. And, said Phillips, I think people are more respectful to things when you give them a personal anecdote. She told about getting a Pap smear a few years ago that came back abnormal. Planned Parenthood was there to ease my anxiety and overactive imagination with scientifically accurate information, statistics and also compassion, she said. They also implanted my free copper IUD, which just so happens to have been the most empowering choice Ive ever made for myself. Phillips grew up in Denton, Texas, just outside of Dallas, and came to Seattle two years ago. Refreshing, she said about living here. Also speaking at the media event was Chris Charbonneau, head of Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest and the Hawaiian Islands. She went through her talking points, such as how more than half the centers were in rural areas, and that without Planned Parenthood, there would be no other place for many patients. Afterward, she also talked about the new reality for employees at Planned Parenthood:, The assumption that they could be surreptitiously recorded, for viral videos such as made by The Center for Medical Progress, the anti-abortion group. She said workers for her group now receive training in recognizing potentially suspicious interviewers or exchanges. How will the abortion issue play in our regional politics, in which Seattle makes the state lean liberal?, I wouldnt think its the top issue, or even among the top three issues, said pollster Stuart Elway. We have a solid history of supporting choice. Were a pretty blue state. Its the fire-breathing Republican Congress who are pushing this. Chris Vance, the states former GOP chairman, is running against Murray in the 2016 election. Hes certainly a long ways from fire-breathing on the issue. Vance says that if an investigation finds that Planned Parenthood broke the law, as the viral videos claim, then different organizations need to be found to provide the same services. But until then, funding for Planned Parenthood stays, he said. There cannot be any interruption in those services, said Vance. The media event at Planned Parenthood was over within an hour. Afterward, in the parking lot, there was a different image, and probably more common at the agency. A young couple emerged from a car, and they walked in, holding hands. They looked anxious.

Even though the campaign was pushed by elite gajillionaires like Bill Gates and Nick Hanauer, the campaign also reported more than 9,000 citizen contributors. It was a bigger, more broadly based campaign than it was given credit for, and it clicked in our increasingly liberal state. Expect this win to be the first word on gun control, not the last  legislators are going to introduce at minimum a bill holding parents liable for crimes committed by youth who get access to an unsecured gun. What happened is the stale politics around this issue was just blown apart. Locally, there was no bigger winner of the election than Seattle Mayor Ed Murray and his progressive dreams. The new mayor has now run the tax table in this town, getting voters to back new levies for a parks district, for buses and for universal preschool. Add the $15 minimum wage and thats a heady series of wins for the mayor. Hes been in office only 10 months!, Expect Seattle to roll out a slew of new tax measures in the year ahead, on roads, police, publicly funded elections, you name it. Why not? The city keeps saying yes. The big fight over Metro Transits buses ended with Seattle voters agreeing to fund our own bus routes ourselves. City leaders had made a hash of the issue  saying it was to stop devastating bus cuts, but switching messages midstream when the cuts were canceled. Anyone who tries to move around the city can see why it passed anyway: We need more transit. So transit won. It always wins in Seattle (except for the monorail  by 80 percent we said were done with that quixotic idea, hopefully for good.), On a state level, candidates and outside interest groups made these the most expensive state legislative races ever. The Senate contest in Redmonds 45th District was the priciest legislative race in state history. All that money changed  nothing. It looks like the GOP will retain control in the state Senate, but by the exact margin as before. Thats a lot of money for both sides to waste to end with the status quo. So now what? Expect more gun legislationand a donnybrook of a Legislative session, with a huge fight over education spending. The election resolved nothing on that front. Nationally, expect Republicans, now in control of the House and Senate, to open more investigations into President Obama. Dont expect Obamacare to be repealed, but theyll try. And expect more war. Im not sure about that last one, but thats what Im most worried about. Danny Westneats column appears Wednesday and Sunday.

{"Content": "[ The conventional wisdom about national political conventions is that they have outlived their purpose. Once, they were the place where the parties actually picked their candidates for president and vice president.  But for at least 30 years now, conventions have been the place where the nominees, long since selected, try to bind up their partys internal wounds and reach out over the heads of the delegates to woo the less partisan voters who usually decide the election. They have become the largest, most expensive infomercials in human experience. So why are we even still having them?, As the parties convene, there will be much chattering that conventions dont matter anymore, that they are a waste of money (some of it taxpayer money) and should be abandoned. Total anachronisms. Parties should scrap `em, sniffs Mark McKinnon, former media adviser to George W. Bush and a co-founder of No Labels, a group devoted to purging hyper-partisanship from politics. The Senate, in fact, voted, 95 to 4 a few weeks ago to cut off in the future the $18.3 million subsidy each party gets to stage (that is the word  stage) the conventions. Homeland Security also gives out $50 million to assure security at each convention. The parties are not likely to give up their moments in the sun, however. Conventions are the time when voters really tune in. Even with the reduced air time the TV networks now give them, conventions bring a spike in attention, says Andrew Kohut, president of the Pew Research Center. Social media is likely to magnify that this year in the same way that it whetted TV audiences appetites for this summers other big event, the London Olympics. The acceptance speeches of the two presidential nominees will be the largest campaign audience either receives until they meet together for the three debates. Those speeches are no small thing. American politics is hardly burdened by too much communication, although if you live in a battleground state saturated with 30-second commercials you might be forgiven for thinking that. The larger problem is too little substantive communication, particularly communication that forces a thought to last longer than the speed of sound-bite. The acceptance speeches are the only time in the entire fall campaign when each candidate speaks directly to the country for an extended time, unfiltered by news coverage or back and forth with an opponent. Other countries arrange time specifically for that sort of thing. Not in America. It is the best chance for a candidate to `introduce himself to the country on his own terms, says former Rep. Mickey Edwards, a Republican from Oklahoma. That is particularly interesting coming from Edwards, who in almost every other respect excoriates the present political system in his new book, The Parties Versus the People. I do, indeed, want to radically overhaul the system, but thats about the voting process, money, partisanship in governing, Edwards says. The convention is not at that level; its more of a `show, more important than mere `entertainment. I see it as something worth watching, and even more so than most of the other stuff on television. Indeed, it is the kind of high-school civics version of campaigning that is otherwise pretty hard to locate in the day-to-day scrum of American national politics these days. If the candidates want to speak directly to the nation after their conventions, they have to pay for the time, as Obama did in 2008. Of course, if the justification for public spending on party events is that the acceptance speech is a public service, the government could just spend that $18.3 million to buy air time for each campaign. That $18.3 million is one of the last remnants of a public finance system that was meant to curb money in politics. The IRS collects $3 from every taxpayer who ticks the box for the presidential campaign fund. But most of the money, some $235 million, is sitting in the government coffers because neither Romney nor Obama is taking their share, preferring instead to go out and raise and spend even more on their own. Since $18 million might not be enough, at going rates, to buy an hour across all the networks and key cable channels, Congress could authorize the Presidential Election Campaign Fund to tap the rest of that money, too, to buy time on the condition it was used for long-form presentations. There will be a great temptation to take this unspent money and plow it back into paying down the government debt. But it would probably increase the chances of actually dealing with that debt if the candidates used the money to explain the fiscal situation and what they planned to do about it. The parties will have to make their own decision whether to continue the conventions without the federal subsidy. They might well, since the conventions are still a valuable tool for rewarding party workers and motivating the base voters of each party, something that could loom particularly large this year in an election that may revolve even more than usually on whose loyalists turn out in the fall (partisan voters do tend to watch their own convention more than the other guys). Conventions werent part of the original plan. The founders by and large hated parties (tellingly, they called them factions) and probably would have hated partisan conventions, which were invented only after they were gone. Conventions were originally thought of as a reform of a system in which congressmen picked the candidates. The first party conventions were before the election of 1832, and nominated Henry Clay to challenge President Andrew Jackson. Delegates arrived at both those party conventions knowing who would get the nomination. Just like this year. But that hasnt stopped conventions from convening every four years since. Even before the federal subsidy is yanked, the conventions are evolving. Once a fixture of midsummer, the Democratic convention this year will actually be after Labor Day, coinciding with the traditional kickoff of fall campaigning. The Democrats had already cut their convention to three days, recognizing a reality that broadcasters werent going to pay attention to their activities on Labor Day anyway. The broadcasters then told the Republicans they wouldnt cover their Monday sessions either, and Hurricane Isaac has now finished the job of washing out day one. Despite separation between church and state, Mother Nature is helping to ensure that the conventions get trimmed from four days to three, said Elizabeth Wilner, vice president of the Kantar/media analysis group.  With Dems really only doing three days, and now Republicans only doing three days, in 2016 there will be pressure to only do three days. Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif. saw this coming. He has served as parliamentarian of the last four GOP conventions. He recalls that in 2008 a Katrina-class hurricane was barreling for the Gulf Coast as the convention convened in Minnesota. His staff got together and figured out a way to compress all the legally required business of the convention  rules, the platform and the nomination of the ticket  into a few hours so delegates from the Gulf Coast, including the governors of Louisiana and Mississippi, could rush home to respond to the looming disaster. This Plan B went unneeded. The hurricane blew out, and the convention went ahead as planned over four days to nominate John McCain and Sarah Palin. While Dreier developed a plan to effectively eliminate the Republican convention, that doesnt mean he would.  There will be a degree of uncertainty about what party conventions will look like in the future, he said as he headed to Tampa. They are going through a bit of a change. But I dont agree they are unnecessary. , EDITORS NOTE  Michael Oreskes is senior managing editor for U.S. news at The Associated Press.

{"Content": "[ The first prosecution arising from the Benghazi attacks is playing out in the federal courthouse blocks from both the White House and Capitol Hill, an appropriate setting for a case that has drawn stark lines between President Barack Obama and Republicans in Congress. The criminal proceedings could provide new insights into the 2012 attacks that killed four Americans and will serve as the latest test of the U.S. legal systems ability to handle terrorism suspects captured overseas. Unfolding during an election year, the case against alleged mastermind Ahmed Abu Khattala could also help shape the legacies of Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder, and spill over into the potential 2016 presidential candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton. Even as the court case slogs forward, it may be challenging for the public to untangle the law from the politics, given how prominent the attacks on the diplomatic compound in the eastern Libyan city have become in U.S. political discourse. Whats going to matter to the public more than anything else is the result, and I think its going to only diffuse some of the ongoing Benghazi conspiracy theories if the Obama administration is going to be able to successfully obtain a conviction in this case, said American University law professor Stephen Vladeck, a national security law expert. Still, he said, the case raises the same legal issues as past terrorism prosecutions and should not by itself be viewed as a referendum on the Obama administration. The story of this case is not the story of the Obama administrations reaction to Benghazi, he added. The story of this case is those who were responsible for Benghazi and those who need to be held accountable for the four deaths that resulted. A 10-minute court appearance amid tight security Saturday was the American publics first concrete sense of Abu Khatalla, the Libyan militant accused by the U.S. government of being a ringleader of the fiery assault on Sept. 11, 2012. U.S. special forces captured him in Libya during a nighttime raid two weeks ago, and he was transported to the U.S. aboard a Navy ship, where he was interrogated by federal agents. He was flown by military helicopter to Washington. Prosecutors have yet to reveal details about their case, with a two-page indictment unsealed Saturday offering no new details. Abu Khattala pleaded not guilty to a single terrorism conspiracy charge punishable by up to life in prison, but the Justice Department expects to bring additional charges soon that may be more substantial and carry more dire penalties. A three-count criminal complaint filed last year and unsealed after his capture charged Abu Khattala with killing a person during an attack on a federal facility  a crime that carries the death penalty. The capture, a significant breakthrough in the investigation, immediately revived a debate on how to treat suspected terrorists from foreign countries: as criminal defendants with the protections of the U.S. legal system or as enemy combatants who should be interrogated for intelligence purposes and put through the military tribunal process at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. If were doing to do this for everybody engaged in terrorism around the world, wed better start building prisons by the dozens, Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich. chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on CNNs State of the Union. He questioned the sheer expense, the manpower, the planning in preparing this criminal case. The Justice Department considers that discussion moot. Though a 2009 plan to prosecute avowed 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and several alleged henchmen in New York was aborted because of political opposition, Holder has said successful terrorism cases in U.S. courts  most recently the March conviction in New York of Osama bin Ladens son-in-law  affirm the civilian justice systems capability of handling such defendants. Experts say the Justice Department would not have embarked on Abu Khattalas capture and prosecution if it didnt feel comfortable after the case. Even so, cases like these are never easy. Witnesses and evidence must be gathered from a hostile foreign country, and some of the evidence may be derived from classified information. Any trial that occurs would take place years after the attack, raising concerns of foggy memories. The case is being handled in Washington, where theres less established case law on terrorism prosecutions than in New York, which more regularly has handled this kind of case. And defense lawyers invariably will raise questions about Abu Khattalas handling, including his interrogation aboard the ship and the point at which he was advised of his Miranda rights. A U.S. official has said Abu Khatalla was read his Miranda rights at some point during the trip and continued talking. Rogers described him as compliant but not cooperative. Theres a whole host of challenges the government faces in this case, said David Laufman, a Washington attorney and former Justice Department national security lawyer. We dont have transparency into how they are grappling with them or how they have or overcome some or all of them. This will not be an easy case to present. No matter how the case proceeds, the political backdrop will be unavoidable. The rampage in Benghazi on the 11th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks has long been a politically divisive issue, fueled by dueling and bipartisan accusations. Republicans have criticized the response by Clinton, then the secretary of state, to the attacks. The GOP has accused the White House of misleading the American public and playing down a terrorist attack in the weeks before the 2012 presidential election. The White House has accused Republicans of politicizing the violence. Multiple investigations and the release of tens of thousands of pages of documents have done little to quell the dispute. Its not clear whether the court case will resolve those questions. But, said Laufman, the legal issues alone will make it fascinating to watch the case unfold.]", "Date": "20140630", "Title": "[Benghazi case unfolds against political backdrop]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/benghazi-case-unfolds-against-political-backdrop-1/", "Author": "[ERIC TUCKER]"}
{"Content": "[ The hulking, wounded elephant in the room of American politics is the disgraceful, scandalous performance of the two political parties over the past 50 years. Elephants are truths that are obvious but too big, too established or too awkward to talk about. Its easy to ignore them. We follow the parties like sports  sometimes frantically, sometimes with disgust, but most voters dont have a favorite team; we follow the players, elections and the fights in Washington. We dont view the two parties through a wider lens. We dont think about if they serve their proper function. We dont really take them seriously as institutions. Why? Mostly because we have no expectations that parties are anything but, well, political  in the worst sense of word. Congress passes laws. The president signs them and is commander in chief. The Supreme Court judges laws. Parties dont belong to that great chain of governing  they are just the two teams that supply the players and trash talk. Unfortunately, we assume the two-party system permanent and unalterable. But the term two-party system is a misnomer. Nothing in the Constitution sanctions a two-party system. The two-party duopoly is an accident of history, not the work of the framers. My list of complaints is long: The parties have created a primary system so prolonged that elected officials are usually in campaign mode; they ceded the power to select and finance candidates and so have little power over their caucuses in Congress; they dont recruit and promote the best and brightest; they have lost the trust and loyalty of voters. But my chief gripe is that they have made it nearly impossible for a third party or an independent presidential candidate to have a fighting chance. They literally have committed a crime of antitrust by conspiring to secure a two-party monopoly on political power. This is their great and legal scandal. This duopoly creates a Catch-22: The rational way to attempt repairing public trust in government and hyperpartisan gridlock in Washington, D.C. is with major changes in how elections are held. Only those who hold political power can do that, but thats against the self-interests of the parties. The only hope for civic improvement can come from outside the duopoly. I believe the only vaguely plausible scenario for that is a well-funded, reform-based, disruptive third party. I hate the word, but name a business that hasnt been disrupted in the past 50 years? I can think of one: the parties. Lusting after a third party is considered politically immature, totally unrealistic and goofy by the grizzled wise. It is like a fan thinking his team can trade a couple draft picks for Aaron Rodgers. That is a shame because the country needs something to stir the pot (besides legalizing pot) and to shoot the elephant in the room. A successful third party is feasible. Rarely has there been a better opportunity. In most recent elections, there has been some third-party spasm, however quixotic: John Anderson, Ross Perot, Unity 08 and Americans Elect in 2012. It is weird that nothing is cooking this round. Why is 2016 ripe? Thanks to the Justice John Roberts Supreme Court, the economics of American elections have been deregulated. It would be easy to finance a third-party campaign. It might be unsavory and against the spirit of reform, but it would be easy. A couple hundred million dollars would fund a competitive campaign. Is there any doubt, for example, that the Koch network could manufacture a credible third-party ticket in 2016? None. It would have a clear libertarian ideology, a ready-made platform, a grass-roots network and the best polling, data mining, marketing and dirty tricks money could buy. Remember, David Koch was the Libertarian vice president candidate in 1980. Here is the other reason: There have never been more voters who call themselves independents. Flipping it, there have never been fewer Democrats and Republicans. The average favorability rating of the two parties combined has been declining on the same steep line as evening news ratings and typewriter sales. This may seem odd because the political arguments we eavesdrop on in social media, online comment boards, cable TV, blogs, political ads and congressional debates are so rabidly partisan, obnoxious and uncompromising. But true believers are a minority of a minority. They just yell the loudest, donate a lot and vote in primaries. So political hacks suck up to them. Polls about trust in the institutions of government  Congress, the presidency, the Supreme Court, political parties  have been hitting new lows for years, essentially since 1968. This is no passing phase. It is the new normal. Black is the new black. A third party is the logical response. Next week, well look at how we might be able to trade for Aaron Rodgers in 2016.

{"Content": "[ The machinery of the worlds finest democracy was on display the other night in downtown Seattle. On display, that is, if you paid $12,500  more than four times what is supposed to be the federal legal limit for a campaign donation  to get into a luxury penthouse to see it. The occasion was that Jeb Bush was in town raising money for his presidential bid. In the old days, before the U.S. Supreme Court blew up the campaign-finance laws, this would have been accomplished painstakingly, coaxing a grand or two at a time from thousands of potential backers. But this is the new gilded age of the super PAC. And somehow, though super PACs are supposed to exist only if they operate independently of any candidate, Bush has his own, called the Right To Rise super PAC. On Monday it was soliciting donations of $25,000 per couple, minimum, to hear a short roundtable with special guest Governor Jeb Bush  as if hed been quite the get for his own political action committee. Its a complete end-run around the law, says Paul Ryan, senior counsel for the Campaign Legal Center, one of those groups still out there screaming into the wind about big money pouring into politics. Its a sham what theyre doing. Its starting out the entire campaign with a lie. Ryan wrote a paper on the topic titled Testing the Waters and the Big Lie. Its about how most of the presidential candidates this year, not just Jeb Bush, have been raising unlimited amounts of money by insincerely pretending they arent running for president. This is why the fine print of Mondays fundraiser specified that it was not authorized by any candidate or candidates committee (not even the one standing right there). Its also why the super PACs website makes no reference to its entire reason for being, which is Jeb Bush, and has no photo of him. Its ridiculous, but the legal premise is that with no candidate, then the super PAC can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money, Ryan said. Once Bush officially announces, all that money will still be there and can be spent on his behalf  though independently, by others, of course. Bush also has a Right to Rise policy group that can raise unlimited amounts, but in secret. (It doesnt have to report the donors, making it so-called dark money.), Similarly, Hillary Clinton, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker and the other big-name candidates all have unlimited-donation super PACS, typically operated for them by supporters. Its only a matter of time before they do their own Northwest cash dashes, also avoiding much interaction with the public or the press to get straight at the rich people. (Bush did do an interview on the Michael Medved radio show, which I was glad to hear.), Whats jaw-dropping is that even the millionaires who went to that Seattle penthouse to fete Bush are rapidly getting priced out of this new political market. Just two brothers, the Kochs, have pledged to pour nearly $900 million into crowning the next president. It wont be long before the entire pre-primary campaign occurs only in private suites wooing not the rich, but the uber-rich. When the Supreme Court poured gas on all this in its Citizens United ruling five years ago, the courts premise was reasonable-sounding, if naive. It was that groups like super PACs cant corrupt because they have to act independently of the politicians. The appearance of influence or access will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote. By definition, an independent expenditure is political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate.

Lawmakers approved a budget that keeps the lights on through Jan. 15 and lets the Treasury Department continue to pay the countrys bills through Feb. 7. This can never happen again, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said Sunday. Added Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell: Therell not be another government shutdown, you can count on that. Thats not to say there is a solution at hand, and no one is rushing forward with alternatives to a potential repeat of the gridlock that shuttered parts of the government for more than two weeks and pushed the nation toward a default on its debt. The political price has been high ahead of 2014s midterm elections, especially for Republicans. I think there was some ground lost from the political point of view, said former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a potential 2016 presidential contender for the GOP. Democratic House Leader Nancy Pelosi of California reiterated the publics reaction to the partisan gamesmanship: I join the American people in their disgust at what happened in terms of the shutdown of government. But theres no real way forward to dodge a repeat and its chief architect, tea party favorite Republican Sen. Ted of Cruz, is urging one. Hundreds of thousands of government workers were sent home amid the shutdown and national parks were barricaded while politicians negotiated. The whole situation could be repeated early next year  combined with economic consequences, perhaps with more severe consequences.

We just went through an awful period for our country, said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. A standoff between President Barack Obama and a group of Republicans over spending for the budget year beginning Oct. 1 and defunding the nations health care overhaul led to the shutdown. Lawmakers also pushed the country to the edge of economic default by threatening the Treasury Departments authority to continue borrowing the money needed to pay the nations bills. The bitter feuding ended on Wednesday, and a group of House and Senate lawmakers has until Dec. 13 to produce a spending deal to stave off another shutdown and possible default in early 2014.

{"Content": "[ THE pathway to the American dream is changing. These days, people need to work hard, play by the rules and pursue a lifelong education. For many Washingtonians, the access to lifelong education starts at the states community and technical colleges. Congress recently introduced legislation that would widen the path to the American dream and lifelong education. Modeled along the lines of President Obamas Americas College Promise proposal, the legislation would reduce financial barriers and send a clear and definitive message that college attendance should be as universal as high school. This is welcome news. The legislation introduced by U.S. Sens. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis. and Cory Booker, D-N.J. would be a significant expansion of these efforts and would represent a milestone in American education. It would allow all first-time students to enroll in high-quality community and technical college programs without having to pay tuition. Students, for their part, would need to enroll on at least a half-time basis, show satisfactory progress, and pursue programs that either fully transfer to four-year institutions or lead to in-demand job credentials. The estimated price tag for the program is $79.7 billion over 10 years, with a 25 percent match from participating states. The legislation also asks states to maintain or exceed their average three-year spending levels for higher education and allocate some higher-education funding based on performance. Available funds would be distributed to states according to their proportion of eligible students nationally. Fortunately for us, Washington state is ahead of the curve in many of these areas and is well positioned if this legislation is enacted. At Seattle Colleges  Seattle Central College, North Seattle College, South Seattle College and Seattle Vocational Institute  we witness firsthand the financial burden and ramifications students face as a result. Its increasingly common to find students balancing school with the demands of working two or three jobs. This is especially true for our low-income and underrepresented populations. We have also seen amazing results when this burden is removed. Our 13th Year Scholarship pays the first year of tuition  about $4,000 for a full-time student  for graduating seniors from Chief Sealth, Cleveland and Rainier Beach high schools regardless of GPA or family income. Under this program, the number of students from these high schools has tripled at South Seattle College. As reported in The Seattle Times, this is a life-changing opportunity for these students. In fact, 60 percent of the 13th Year Scholars are the first in their families to attend college. Another one of our programs, the Seattle Promise scholarship, covers tuition when state and federal aid fall short. Without these initiatives, many students would take out loans or abandon their pursuit of education altogether. With them, students thrive and go on to become the employees, entrepreneurs, consumers and taxpayers who keep our states economy vibrant. Everyone  Democrats, Republicans and independents alike  knows that higher education yields high returns for our students and our economy. The most cost-effective means of delivering higher education is through community and technical colleges.

{"Content": "[ The Port of Seattle has been busy this past year: the Seaport Alliance was first announced in October; labor negotiations between the International Longshore and Warehouse Union and its employers hit a snag during a prime shipping season for Washington agriculture, and in January the Port announced Terminal 5 would be the new home port for Shells Arctic drilling fleet. Going into election season, two of the five seats for the Port of Seattle Commission are on this years ballot, and the recent attention on the Port has helped attract a dozen candidates. The Port of Seattle, which is governed by the commissioners, operates one of the states busiest seaports, plus Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, two cruise terminals, marinas and Fishermens Terminal, which is the headquarters of the North Pacific fishing fleet. As part of its primary mission, the Port serves as an economic development agency, generating family-wage jobs and economic growth in King County. While Courtney Gregoire is running for re-election for Position 2, Bill Bryant, who has held Position 5 for the past eight years, is running for governor, a 2016 race. Bryants open Port seat has drawn nine candidates for the Aug. 4 primary. The two to receive the most votes will advance to the November general election. Leading the Position 5 race in money raised is Darrell Bryan. He is well known in the maritime industry as the former president and CEO of Clipper Navigations, which operates the Victoria Clipper. He has pulled in more than $76,000 as of Friday, much of which came from the maritime community, including the CEOs of Vigor Industrial and Foss Maritime  as well as other Foss and Saltchuk employees, according to the state Public Disclosure Commission. Ken Rogers, a longtime pilot, labor leader and board member for Delta Air Lines, has raised about $46,500, almost half of which came directly from Delta leadership, pilots and people with ties to the company. With the Port finalizing plans for Sea-Tacs new international arrivals facility, Delta and Alaska Airlines have been butting heads over using passenger fees to fund the new international facility. Not surprisingly, Alaska Airlines has not named Rogers as a candidate worthy of consideration; instead, the Seattle-based company gave that rating to Bryan and Herb Krohn. As a railroad conductor and rail-union leader, Krohn has support from much of the labor community and has raised about $17,000 for the race. As a self-described pro-business labor leader, he told The Seattle Times Editorial Board he would have supported the Foss Maritime lease to host Shells Arctic oil-drilling fleet at Terminal 5 had he been in the position. Fred Felleman, a marine environmental consultant, and Marion Yoshino, former City Council member for Normandy Park and economic development manager for Des Moines, have both been critical of the lack of transparency behind that lease agreement.

{"Content": "[ The Republican Party thats showing its face to America this week is a restless institution that relies heavily on the uncompromising passions of tea partyers, anti-immigration activists and social conservatives. Its a potent but unruly coalition that supplies vital energy today but poses serious challenges for the future. These forces propelled the GOP to big wins in 2010, and they might help Mitt Romney win the White House this fall. But they operate largely beyond his control, sometimes igniting brushfires and pulling his campaign off message. More troubling for the Republican Party in future elections is that these fiery conservatives seem to be turning off many Hispanic voters, the fastest-growing segment of the American electorate. The challenge facing GOP leaders as they hold their nominating convention and look to the future: trying to win elections and push their agenda through Congress by harnessing the energy of these conservatives without letting that energy turn on them  and without letting it put the party badly out of step with a nation thats rapidly becoming less white. In Romney, the convention-goers in Tampa are nominating a former corporate executive who fits somewhat uneasily in the partys decades-long rightward shift, which manifests itself most clearly in Congress. Social conservatives remain wary of Romney, who once backed abortion rights and gun control. Their antipathy toward President Barack Obama, however, may well nudge them along to polling places in November. That is Romneys great hope, even as he and his GOP establishment allies try to dampen some of the political rights most vocal figures. Romney and others urged a Missouri congressman to drop out of the Senate race after he made widely condemned remarks about rape and pregnancy. Romneys words angered some religious activists who see the congressman, Todd Akin, as a champion of anti-abortion efforts. On the economic front, Romney is in step with his partys anti-tax advocates. He promises to cut taxes further, saying that will help strengthen the economy despite some economists warnings that tax cuts have contributed heavily to the nations massive debt. GOP lawmakers adamant opposition to tax hikes, even on the wealthiest families, puts them at odds with most Americans. The issue might loom larger as efforts to tame the federal debt intensify. Much more problematic is the Republican Partys strained relationship with minorities, especially a fast-growing Hispanic population alarmed by the sometimes sharp tone of conservatives on illegal immigrants. The party may need to address that problem before long to avoid falling behind Democrats in key states. For now, Republicans have a right to party with some swagger in Tampa. Strategists in both parties say Romney has a solid chance of defeating Obama. In congressional races, Republicans are well-positioned to keep their House majority. And they might pick up the handful of Senate seats they need to take control of that chamber, too. Should those three things happen, Republicans will be able to reshape much of the governments tax, spending and regulatory policies to their liking, checked only by Senate Democrats ability to sustain filibusters here and there. Republicans presumably would dismantle much of Obamacare, extend all the Bush-era income tax cuts, reduce other levies including the corporate tax, cut federal payments to Medicaid and loosen regulations on banks and other businesses. But whether Romney wins or not, his partys congressional leaders will continue to struggle to keep a lid on their tea party wing. Several more Republicans who vow not to compromise with Democrats are headed to Congress, and they will give new headaches to House and Senate leaders seeking ways to pass legislation in a nation thats split almost 50-50 politically. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, at a recent event hosted by Bloomberg View, said his partys rightward shift on a host of issues  coupled with the growing aversion to almost any form of compromise with Democrats, especially in the House  is endangering its ability to assemble winning coalitions in the future. Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, he said, wouldnt feel welcome in todays dogmatic GOP. Thats the paradox facing party activists in Tampa. The fiery, ideological stances enlivening the party this fall might, in just a few years, put it at odds with an increasingly diverse electorate inclined to weigh the drawbacks as well as the benefits of an activist government. Opposition to Obamas proposed health care overhaul gave rise to the tea party movement in 2009. Public aversion to Democrats sharp-elbow tactics in passing the measure, plus persistently high unemployment, powered Republicans to big gains in the 2010 midterm elections. They gained control of the House and turned their focus to Obama. Many conservatives said the results proved that a hardline, uncompromising strategy works. But midterm elections draw smaller and more ideological electorates than do presidential elections, said Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz. I think some conservatives are taking the wrong lesson, he said. Short-term, were heading to a very competitive presidential race, Abramowitz said. But long-term, I think its more troubling for Republicans, because they are becoming increasingly dominated by white conservatives in a country thats becoming increasingly diverse in terms of race and ethnicity, and more moderate, at least on social issues. The need to reach out to Latinos in particular, and non-whites in general, will require the Republican Party to moderate some of its positions, Abramowitz said. There seems to be little appetite for that. I think the partys in a great position right now, said Rep. Kenny Marchand, R-Texas. I dont find my constituents back home give me a whole lot of latitude on these issues. They hold me pretty much to repealing Obamacare, extending the Bush tax cuts. But what about the Republicans prospects for winning national elections in 2016 and beyond? While the countrys non-white population keeps growing rapidly, the GOP keeps relying heavily on white voters. The statistics trouble GOP strategists eyeing the future. Ninety percent of John McCains presidential vote in 2008 came from whites, as did 91 percent of George W. Bushs vote in 2000. Whites are steadily shrinking as a share of the U.S. population. They accounted for 69 percent in 2000, and 64 percent in 2010. They are on track to slip below 50 percent of the population in 2042, the Census Bureau says, largely because of the rapid growth of Hispanics. Obama won comfortably in 2008 despite taking only 43 percent of the white vote. He did it by winning 95 percent of the black vote and by beating McCain more than 2-to-1 among Hispanics. Two out of three registered Hispanic voters say they will vote for Obama, while 23 percent back Romney, according to a poll by NBC News, The Wall Street Journal and Telemundo. Republicans must change these ratios if theyre to win national elections in the coming decades. Some GOP leaders, however, fear the party is sowing deep seeds of anger among Hispanics by rejecting calls for comprehensive immigration reform, including pathways to legal status for millions of illegal immigrants. George W. Bush and other prominent Republicans once championed that view, but it has fallen deeply out of favor. Dont just talk about Hispanics and say immediately we must have controlled borders, said Jeb Bush, the brother of one Republican president and son of another. Change the tone. Nominating conventions work better as pep rallies than philosophical, agenda-setting forums. Republican activists in Tampa will party, cheer and shout about their determination to make Obama a one-term president. But eventually  perhaps sooner rather than later  party leaders will have to confront demographic and voting trends. Then they will have to decide how long to stick with an uncompromising agenda that appeals mainly to white voters, a group whose influence shrinks with each passing month.]", "Date": "20120827", "Title": "[Happy now for tea party help, GOP faces challenges]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/happy-now-for-tea-party-help-gop-faces-challenges/", "Author": "[CHARLES BABINGTON]"}
{"Content": "[ The results from the Aug. 4 primary election wont be officially certified until next week, but with very few ballots still left to count, most races are safe to call. The top two vote-getters in each race will move ahead to the Nov. 3 general election. All nine of the nonpartisan Seattle City Council seats are up for grabs this year, with seven of them attached to geographic voting districts for the first time in modern history. The candidates bound for the November ballot are, in order of how theyll finish:, In District 1 (West Seattle, Delridge, South Park), Lisa Herbold and Shannon Braddock. In District 2 (Southeast Seattle), Bruce Harrell and Tammy Morales. In District 3 (Capitol Hill, Central District), Kshama Sawant and Pamela Banks. In District 4 (Northeast Seattle, Eastlake), Rob Johnson and Michael Maddux. In District 5 (North Seattle), Debora Juarez and Sandy Brown. In District 6 (Fremont, Ballard, Phinney Ridge), Mike OBrien and Catherine Weatbrook. In District 7 (Magnolia, Queen Anne, downtown), Sally Bagshaw and Deborah Zech-Artis. In citywide Position 8, Tim Burgess and Jon Grant. In citywide Position 9, Lorena Gonzlez and Bill Bradburd. Harrell, Sawant, OBrien, Bagshaw and Burgess are current council members. A sixth current council member, Jean Godden, conceded in the District 4 race last week after results showed her falling far behind Johnson and Maddux. Council members Tom Rasmussen and Nick Licata arent running for re-election. Neither is Councilmember John Okamoto, who was appointed as a temporary replacement for former Councilmember Sally Clark after she resigned earlier this year. The closest primary race is in District 1, where Herbolds lead on Braddock was only about 400 votes Tuesday, a week after primary day. Officials have counted 17,685 ballots in District 1, or about 29 percent of the number of registered voters there. There were about 400 additional District 1 ballots as of Tuesday that had been returned but not yet verified. Phillip Tavel is running third in District 1, about 1,700 votes behind Braddock. Officials have counted 125,573 ballots in the citywide races, or about 30 percent of the number of registered voters in Seattle. The final turnout-percentage on Aug. 18 will be slightly higher. The race with the best turnout will almost certainly be District 3, where officials have counted 22,578 ballots, or about 36 percent of the number of registered voters. In the race for Bellevue City Council Position 7, bicycle and neighborhood activist Lyndon Heywood maintained a slight lead over anti-light-rail candidate Bill Hirt. Heywood had 1,913 votes to Hirts 1,802 after Tuesdays update. The winner will face incumbent Jennifer Robertson, a land-use attorney, who overwhelmed her two opponents with 12,872 votes, or 77percent of the total. In the nine-candidate race for Port of Seattle Commission Position 5, Fred Felleman, who received 25 percent of the vote, will face Marion Yoshino, who received 18 percent. Felleman said he thinks receiving a quarter of the votes is a clear indication that King County voters agree with him that in order for the Port to grow responsibly in the face of climate change, the commission must work to advance clean energy jobs that will support our families, workers and unions now and into the future.

{"Content": "[ The Washington Supreme Court has refused to block a public vote on Tim Eymans latest anti-tax initiative. The court Friday rejected an appeal by opponents of Initiative 1366, who argued the measure should be removed from the November ballot because it blatantly exceeds the scope of citizen-initiative powers allowed by the state constitution. In a unanimous decision, the court said opponents of the measure had not met the high legal threshold to block a vote on a citizen initiative already certified for the ballot. I-1366 seeks to pressure state lawmakers into sending a constitutional amendment to the 2016 ballot that would restore a two-thirds vote requirement for any tax increases enacted by the Legislature. The supermajority rule would not apply to taxes sent to voters for approval. If legislators refuse to put that amendment to a public vote, the initiative would cut the states 6.5-cent sales tax by a penny  reducing state revenues by more than $1.4billion a year. The two-thirds rule for legislative-tax votes had been approved in previous initiative votes but was struck down as unconstitutional in 2013. Tim Eymans use of initiative money is investigated, The state constitution cannot be amended directly by a citizen initiative. The Legislature, with a two-thirds vote of the House and Senate, can place proposed amendments on the ballot, which then require a majority public vote to be enacted. Opponents of I-1366 argue it amounts to an illegal effort to sidestep that process by strong-arming legislators into launching an amendment process. Lawyers representing Eyman and Secretary of State Kim Wyman had argued that voters deserve a chance to debate the measure and urged the court to keep it on the November ballot. Wymans office had asked for a Supreme Court ruling by this week so that county elections offices could start printing ballots and voters guides for the November election. In a statement, Wyman applauded the court decision as a win for Washington voters and our states initiative process. Eyman blasted the efforts to halt a public vote on I-1366, saying opponents dont trust the voters and believe the people arent smart enough to understand our measure. Opponents vowed to defeat the initiative  whether at the ballot box or through another legal challenge. I-1366 would lock in place our states upside-down tax system and make it nearly impossible to close tax loopholes or fully fund education, said Collin Jergens, a spokesman for Fuse Washington, a liberal advocacy group backing the legal challenge. The lawsuit to block the initiative vote was filed by a group that included Democratic state legislators, parents of public-schools children and social-services advocates. King County Superior Court Judge Dean Lum ruled last month the initiative appeared to violate the state constitution  and likely would be invalidated at some point if it were passed  but he declined a request by plaintiffs to halt a vote on the measure. The decision Friday by the Supreme Court upheld Lums decision. The court issued only a brief ruling, saying a more detailed opinion explaining its reasoning would be forthcoming.]", "Date": "20150904", "Title": "[State Supreme Court wont block Eyman anti-tax initiative vote]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/supreme-court-wont-block-eyman-initiative-vote/", "Author": "[Jim Brunner]"}
{"Content": "[ The Washington Supreme Courts late-Friday decision striking down the states charter-school law has sparked a national fundraising campaign to keep existing schools afloat  at least for the school year. The state Charter Schools Association announced Tuesday that it is confident it can raise enough money to keep the states nine charters and their 1,200 students operating through June. If for any reason the public funding becomes unavailable, were going to do whatever is necessary to ensure that these schools can keep the promise that theyve made to families and keep the doors open through the end of the year, said Tom Franta, the associations CEO. Guest column:Why charter schools are worth saving, Franta also said his organization, a private group created to support charter schools in Washington, intends to file a motion asking the court to reconsider its ruling. The court said the states charter-school law is unconstitutional because charters are overseen by appointed rather than elected boards. That means the schools cant receive state taxpayer dollars. The parties have 20 days to file motions asking the court to reconsider. Charters are a type of public school that receive tax dollars but are operated privately. Franta estimated it will take about $14 million to make up for lost public funding if the courts decision holds. His organization didnt have the full amount in hand Tuesday. It was still contacting potential donors, which Franta said are likely to include those who contributed to the 2012 campaign, when voters narrowly approved the ballot measure that made Washington one of the last of the 42 states in the nation to allow charter schools. Some of the biggest donors then included Microsoft co-founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen and Wal-Mart heiress Alice Walton. Were working on a broad network of supporters across the country, Franta said. I hope that those individuals who played a role in the initiative will also play a role in ensuring the continuity of these schools, assuming its necessary to do so. Franta said his association is working under the assumption that if the ruling becomes final, charter schools will lose access to federal funding, as well. Public schools receive federal money to provide school lunches and academic help for low-income students, and for special-education programs for children with disabilities. The court heard arguments in the case last October and issued the long-anticipated ruling after some charter schools had been in session for a few weeks. First Place Scholars charter school opens in Seattle on Wednesday for its second year of operation, after a turbulent first year marked by personnel and financial trouble. It received its first state payment for the coming school year in August. The other eight schools werent due to receive their first public money until the end of September. Along with the charter associations pledge, some of the schools also promised to keep going despite that they may not get the tax dollars they expected. This decision does not close our school, Adel Sefrioui, founder and executive director of Excel Public Charter School in Kent, told worried parents at a morning meeting Tuesday. Sefrioui said his school has raised enough money over the past 18 months to operate through June without state or federal funding. But he encouraged parents to lobby politicians to convene a special legislative session to find a solution. The school plans to bus parents and students to Seattle for a rally Thursday, which is scheduled at Summit Sierra charter school in the Chinatown International District. Deanne Hilburn, the mother of a sixth-grade boy at Excel, said at the parents meeting that she wanted her son at the school, which is beginning its fourth week, because he had been having a rough time in the Kent School District. He was angry. He was frustrated. He came home sick to his stomach almost every day, she said. In these three short weeks, he has become this young man that I always knew was there. Sefrioui estimates it will take about $2 million to operate his school this year, which started with 160 sixth- and seventh-graders. Charter-school supporters worked through the Labor Day weekend figuring out how to respond to the high courts 6-3 ruling. The Washington State Charter School Commission called an emergency meeting for Wednesday morning to respond to the ruling. Although the high courts in Georgia and Florida have struck down laws creating state commissions to approve charter schools, the Washington ruling is the first to render an entire charter-school law unconstitutional, according to the National Association of Charter School Authorizers. The decision and its timing have generated national headlines and quick opinions, but policymakers are still sorting out what the ruling means. House Majority Leader Pat Sullivan, D-Covington, said legislators in his caucus are still going through the court opinion, trying to figure it out. Legal staff are preparing options for lawmakers, ranging from a constitutional amendment to making changes to the budget, although Sullivan said he doesnt believe the latter would resolve the issue. I would guess by the end of this week wed have some options to consider, he said. A constitutional amendment would require a two-thirds majority vote in both the state House and Senate to put it on the general election ballot for a simple majority of voters to approve. While a special session is a possibility, Sullivan said, there wouldnt be as much pressure for lawmakers to convene one to propose a constitutional amendment. Lawmakers could vote on such an amendment during their regular session early next year and still get it on the November 2016 ballot. Sen. Steve Litzow, R-Mercer Island, said he doesnt think lawmakers will return before January. Weve been calling for [a special session] the last couple days, said Litzow, who chairs the Senate Early Learning & K-12 Education Committee. There doesnt seem to be a lot of momentum for that with the governors office or with the House Democrats. Lawmakers, according to Litzow, are trying to understand the decisions impact on legislative funding and the issue of elected boards. ]", "Date": "20150908", "Title": "[Survival lesson throws parents, charter schools into fundraising, politics]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/education/two-charters-say-they-will-stay-open-this-year-despite-supreme-court-ruling/", "Author": "[John Higgins, Joseph O'Sullivan]"}
{"Content": "[ There arent many people who think Vice President Joe Biden could be elected the next president. But he is said to be thinking about running because Hillary Clinton is conducting a terrible campaign and Bidens beloved son Beau urged his father to run shortly before he heartbreakingly died of brain cancer. If Biden has the stomach for it, he should run because he would make the Democratic race more interesting  much more interesting  and he would make Clinton a better candidate. With the Republican race currently Trumpified, the American people are getting short shrift. Too few candidates are talking seriously about issues that really matter, including Clinton. She refuses to give her views on such vital matters as the pending trade deal and Keystone XL pipeline on grounds that this is up to the Obama administration. How infuriating! She parrots the phrase, Black lives matter, which is the same as saying, Honesty is the best policy. Well, duh. Of course! But were still waiting for a bold vision from her on anything. So far she has offered no new initiatives other than dusting off a proposal to raise capital-gains taxes for short-term investors. She cant say how she would get anything passed by a divided Congress that basically ignores Obama. Obama has done some good things for this country, but has not been able to convince people of that. Biden, unbridled from being a loyal backbencher, could much more forcefully defend the administration he has been a part of for eight years and express his thoughts on what it has failed to do. This election should be a referendum on the last eight years as well as a national discussion on where we want to be headed and what kind of people we want to be. That the independent senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders, has a cult following among progressives should not be a surprise. People are desperate for passion, candor and fire in the belly. His campaign is a quixotic and refreshing throwback to the Eugene McCarthy era, but Sanders cannot be elected president. It is clear that Clinton does not take him seriously and that she has no intention of moving to the left, which would be a disaster for her in 2016. Marylands former Gov. Martin OMalley, former Gov. and Sen. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and former Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia are all nice-guy Democrats, but have no traction and will be asterisks in the race. Biden as sitting vice president has more clout. The latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll indicates that Americans are scared and worried about their economic future in a global economy that is leaving the middle class behind. We need to hear Bidens unvarnished views on why 65 percent of those surveyed insist the country is on the wrong track. That is slightly worse than similar sentiment during the peak years of dissatisfaction with George W. Bushs presidency. Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, whose father and brother were presidents, is slipping fast in the polls. Its still looking like another Bush-Clinton slugfest in November 2016, but you can hear the national sigh of disappointment. Most worrisome to Democrats should be the lackluster and flawed campaign Clinton is running. She cant seem to get past questions about her familys foundation and the poor judgment she showed with keeping a private email server while serving as secretary of state. Americans want a candidate of optimism, not one mired in past scandals and unanswered questions  nor one who cant seem to shake a cloak of arrogance. Biden may lack the magic of charisma but he has been heavily involved in the mechanics of government for decades and should be able to answer any questions we put to him. He is well-liked by his peers and respected as a straight shooter. This may well be an anti-establishment, anti-Washington election. But for now we say, bring it on, Joe.

{"Content": "[ This is a look for the blue Puget Sound region at the economics of the commanding Republican majority in Congress after this past Tuesdays election. I hope red-leaning voters will tag along and see if I do a fair job. The first thing to remember is that this is not the Republican Party of old. President Nixon funded the Great Society, established the Environmental Protection Agency, experimented with price controls and said, Were all Keynesians now. Even President Reagan worked with Democratic House Speaker Tip ONeill and repeatedly raised taxes. Todays Republicans are deeply committed to an agenda of economic freedom. Fear them or love them, they are deeply principled. I am also skeptical of pundits that say gridlock will continue so Republicans can gain an advantage for 2016, or that the election was largely meaningless. As political blogger Andrew Sullivan put it: This is a victory in favor of more governing paralysis. The energetic Republican base and the most influential Republicans in Congress want action. It just wont necessarily be what the mainstream consider important. The biggest example is immigration reform. Republicans consider any such policy as amnesty. They want 12 million illegal immigrants deported or to go home on their own. Whether policies to make that happen could overcome an Obama veto is another matter. But we wont see reform. And millions of Americans already competing for too few jobs may see that as a good thing. Energy and climate change will be profoundly affected. Approval of the long-delayed Keystone XL pipeline, running 1,660 miles from Alberta to Texas, is now virtually guaranteed. Democrats will be unlikely to duplicate the discipline shown by Republicans in the Senate minority. So some Democrats can be peeled off to join the GOP on this vote and probably others. Also, the Senate can bypass filibusters on reconciliation of budget laws with a simple 51-vote majority. The Obama administration has hardly been hostile to the oil industry, as seen with the increased production from fracking. But Congress will push to open more areas to drilling. It also has a host of tools, including funding, to defeat the Environmental Protection Agencys plans to limit carbon emissions. The probable chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works is Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma. He says climate change is a hoax. Any efforts to limit greenhouse-gas emissions or switch subsidies from fossil fuels to clean energy are dead. The Export-Import Bank, the government credit agency that is a great help to Boeing, faces the biggest hurdle in its 80-year history. Many Republicans, especially in the House, want to close it as unnecessary government meddling and industrial policy. We will see if Boeings enhanced workforces in such red states as South Carolina can change minds. The new Congress is also a big win for Wall Street, even though many tea-party Republicans claim to hate the financial titans. But with Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch likely to take over leadership of the financial-services committee, look for changes to the Dodd-Frank law and other post-meltdown laws and rules. Two likely targets are the Volcker Rule on derivatives and the Consumer Financial Protection Agency. Republicans have been highly critical of both. If you see a pattern, Iowa Sen.-elect Joni Ernst summed it up, calling for an agenda that supports rolling back Washington-created job-killing regulations that are crushing small business. Big business, too  even though it is booking record profits. Thus the REINS Act, championed by Sen. Rand Paul, would require every rule set by the executive branch with an economic impact of $100 million or more to be approved by lawmakers. The new Congress may ease up on the so-called sequester, which demands across-the-board spending cuts. A big reason: The majority will want more military spending. This could be good news for the areas military installations. Critics say sequester has done the most damage to military readiness and modernization. But dont expect a Reagan-like increase in general spending to boost the economy. Todays Republicans are united in stopping what they see as overspending and over-borrowing. The unprecedented austerity of recent years, which has held back demand, will continue or become even more severe. The Puget Sound regions cities are in for difficult days. The red-blue divide is more rural, exurbs and some suburbs vs. urban areas than between states. As a result, programs to help cities will suffer. Expect a serious effort to kill Amtrak, a longtime passion of Sen. John McCain. While I say every form of transportation is subsidized and Amtrak has never been more popular and needed, Republicans see it differently. That Amtrak cant pay its own way and should be eliminated, the profitable Northeast Corridor sold to the private sector. The Federal Reserve can expect much tougher scrutiny. Paul and many tea-party Republicans want the Fed audited and subject to tighter political control. Expect new moves to lower taxes. If inequality exists, Republicans argue that it is a result of intrusive government holding back business. The influential Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank, wants a flat tax. It could happen. Blue trade supporters can take some comfort. The new Senate will be more likely to approve fast-track authority for the president on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I think most of these policies will be disastrous. But, as the late Mo Udall said, The voters have spoken  the bastards.

{"Content": "[ This summer, as Washington bakes in a West Coast drought, a flock of petition-toting activists has fanned out to parks, festivals and street corners, trying to force the sort of sweeping action on global warming that has eluded state lawmakers. Theyre wrangling signatures for Initiative 732, which would put a new tax on carbon burned in gasoline, natural gas and other fossil fuels  while cutting other taxes by an equal amount. By raising the price of dirty energy, I-732 aims to cut greenhouse-gas emissions and encourage development of cleaner alternatives. Thats a goal shared by Gov. Jay Inslee, environmentalists, labor and other Democratic Party allies, who backed carbon-pricing legislation that was stymied this year in the Legislature. So you might think theyd get behind the scrappy, grass-roots I-732 campaign, known as Carbon Washington. Nope. Instead, a powerful coalition that includes the states major green and labor groups is trying to squash the effort. Leaders of the Alliance for Jobs and Clean Energy have sought to discredit I-732 in recent weeks. Theyve circulated poll results that suggest it would be rejected by voters. And theyve argued the initiative is insensitive to communities of color. Alliance members say theyre working on their own climate-initiative proposal for 2016, one that would divvy up tax dollars differently, include input from a more diverse crowd, and, most important, have a better chance to pass. So, while they appreciate I-732s goals and enthusiasm, theyd prefer it please step aside. I think the best thing for the climate movement is for all of us to come together and combine our strength, said Lisa MacLean, a Democratic political consultant and director of the alliance. I-732 backers say theyve waited long enough for action from the political establishment and are pushing ahead. They say that there might be another measure. I feel like some of those folks have been saying that for years, said Yoram Bauman, co-founder of Carbon Washington. Both sides say this is a disagreement among friends. They all want the state to take serious action on climate. They just disagree on the best approach. The I-732 crowd is more of an upstart, eclectic bunch, led by Bauman, a Ph.D. economist who also performs as a comedian. He bills himself as the worlds first-and-only stand-up economist. But hes dead serious about climate policy. And he says a carbon tax is both the most transparent and politically feasible idea to cut emissions. He points to British Columbia, which has had a similar carbon tax in place since 2008. The I-732 campaign has grown from a volunteer operation to one with several paid staff, a headquarters near Gas Works Park and more than 20 chapters across the state. The campaign has raised $250,000. Still, there is no guarantee theyll make the ballot. Organizers expect to reach about 100,000 signatures by the end of July. As an initiative to the Legislature they need 246,732 valid signatures from registered voters by the end of the year. That would force lawmakers to either pass the measure or send it to a public vote. The effort may face rough shoals ahead, with the politically connected alliance leadership discouraging support. As with many political disputes, this one is largely about money. As a revenue-neutral plan, I-732 would not fill state government coffers with cash. While the carbon tax would raise an estimated $1.7 billion a year  and cost the average family an estimated $300 a year in higher gas and energy prices  it would give away an equivalent amount back to consumers, mostly through a full percentage point cut in the state sales tax. That differs from cap-and-trade legislation offered up by Inslee and backed by the alliance in this years legislative session. That plan would have raised more than $1billion a year from fees on carbon and directed the proceeds to the state education budget, transportation projects, affordable housing and other programs. While the alliances 2016 initiative has not been revealed, its clear that backers dont agree with I-732s revenue-neutral approach. Michael Mann, a member of the alliance steering committee, stressed that he respects Baumans effort. The proposal hes put together is a strong economic model for carbon reduction. The issue for me is, its got to be politically feasible, said Mann, an environmental consultant and lobbyist. Thats the holy grail that the alliance is looking to develop. Mann and other alliance supporters suggest that spending carbon-tax revenues on clean-energy investments, schools and other community programs could prove more popular than tax cuts. Meanwhile, polling results circulated by the alliance claim I-732 starts at just 39 percent support when voters are read the ballot title. While arguments for the measure boosted support in the poll, MacLean said its numbers are too weak to withstand likely assaults from the fossil-fuel industry. She declined to release the full poll results. I-732 supporters disagree. They say a youthful electorate that will turn out in 2016s presidential election gives their proposal more than a fighting chance. And they argue a carbon tax is simpler to grasp for voters than alternatives like a cap-and-trade plan, which relies on auctioned pollution permits bought and sold in a stock-exchangelike system. Hendrik Wolff, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Washington, whose research includes climate policy, said both cap-and-trade and carbon taxes are viable paths to the same goal. The advantage (of a carbon tax) is that it is easier administratively to implement, said Wolff, who supports the initiative. Other I-732 backers say it would be foolish to run a climate initiative that also seeks to grow government spending. With its revenue-neutral approach, I-732 can draw support from across the political spectrum, supporters argue. The difference between Carbon Washington and the Alliance is that Carbon Washington is building a bipartisan coalition, and the Alliance is building a coalition of the left, said Joe Ryan, a board member of Carbon Washington and former president of the Washington Environmental Council (which is part of the alliance). Todd Myers, environmental director for the Washington Policy Center, a free-market think tank, has backed I-732s British Columbia-style carbon-tax approach. However, its a stretch to believe many Republicans would support the carbon tax. Rejecting the international scientific consensus on climate change, the state Republican Party platform contends warming from human generated greenhouse gases has yet to be proven. Most of the I-732 endorsers hail from the more liberal side of politics, including Seattle City Councilman Nick Licata, former Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn and former King County Executive Ron Sims. But the alliance boasts a much longer list of supporters, including groups closely associated with the Democratic Partys political base, from the state Labor Council to green business and transit activists. It also includes groups representing African-American, Latino and other minority communities. And some leaders of those groups are criticizing the I-732 campaign, which they say has failed to be so inclusive. Climate change will disproportionately affect poor and minority communities, they note, so any climate initiative ought to place racial equity front and center. We believe that is what it will take to fight and win against the fossil-fuel industry, said Aiko Schaefer, a coordinator of Communities of Color for Climate Justice. Peter Bloch-Garcia, executive director of the Latino Community Fund of Washington, said an adequate climate proposal must fund targeted investments in underresourced and underinvested communities. Bauman countered that I-732 will help the poor and minority communities  by fighting climate change, cutting the regressive sales tax, and by funding the Working Families Tax Credit, which would offer a tax rebate of up to $1,500 a year for 400,000 low-income working families. Notwithstanding their current disagreements, both sides continue to talk. McGinn, who endorsed I-732, said he was drawn to the grass roots and volunteer energy. He criticized the lackluster leadership of larger environmental groups that have been overly deferential to politicians who havent delivered. But McGinn said hes largely agnostic on whether a carbon tax or some other alternative is the best approach. He predicted I-732 supporters and the alliance may wind up under the same tent by 2016. There is plenty of time for everyone to make peace, he said.]", "Date": "20150725", "Title": "[Carbon-tax initiative divides environmentalists]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/carbon-tax-initiative-divides-environmentalists/", "Author": "[Jim Brunner]"}
{"Content": "[ To begin: This is not a story about Ron Paul. Not exactly, anyway. And yet to get where we want to go we will start at OPA!, a Greek restaurant on the edge of town where Clark County Republicans and tea party conservatives gathered on Nevada primary night for what looked undeniably like a Ron Paul rally. In one corner was Cindy Lake, the acting chair of the Clark County Republican Party and a delegate to this summers Republican National Convention. A self-described libertarian Republican constitutional conservative, Lake became a Paul convert in 2007 after she heard him advocate for something she passionately supports: the freedom to buy raw milk. Nearby stood Megan Heryet, celebrating her GOP primary victory in a state Assembly race. Heryet, a real estate agent, substitute teacher and mom, is hardly a Paul fanatic. But she did back him in Nevadas caucuses earlier this year, primarily because she is a big proponent of being free to make decisions such as choosing to give birth to her second child at home instead of a hospital. Its about being left alone, she said. And there were the Bunce brothers, Richard and Carl, who marshaled a four-year Paulist takeover of the Nevada Republican Party. The tax system is their biggest irritation. This is the land of the free, said Carl. How free are we when weve got a government that can choose how much money we keep in our paycheck?, But we promised this wouldnt be about Ron Paul and, in fact, it really isnt. Rather its about unpasteurized milk and home births and taxes and, yes, freedom. Somethings going on in America this election year: a renaissance of an ideal as old as the nation itself  that live-and-let-live, get-out-of-my-business, individualism vs. paternalism dogma that is the hallmark of libertarianism. Paul, the Texas congressman and GOP presidential hopeful who champions small government and individual liberty, is one manifestation of it. We saw that with his rising popularity during the Republican presidential primary season and, now, the recent takeovers of political conventions in Nevada, Minnesota, Maine, Louisiana and elsewhere that will result in a sizable faction of Paul delegates at the GOP convention come August. There are questions of how all of that might affect the choice of a GOP vice presidential candidate and the Republican Party platform. But what looms are far larger questions about whether an America fed up with government bans and government bailouts  with government, period  is seeing a return to its libertarian roots. And, if so, what that might mean in a potentially close presidential race and long after election 2012 is a mere memory. Theres this kind of growing distrust of the institutions of government, and so it leads folks to step back and say, `Well if theyre not working, then we ought to have less of them in our lives, said Wayne Lesperance, director of the Center for Civic Engagement at New England College in the Live Free or Die state of New Hampshire. Pauls libertarian message joins people who probably under any other circumstances would not see the world the same way and gets them politically involved, Lesperance said. It is a challenge for the Republicans to wrap their arms around this and harness this in a way that gets them an electoral victory. This will all be hotly debated this coming week as thousands converge on the Las Vegas Strip for a libertarian fete called FreedomFest. U.S. Sen. Rand Paul  Rons son and the future hope of many limited-government enthusiasts  will speak, along with a slew of libertarian-leaning politicians, scholars, economists and entrepreneurs, from Whole Foods CEO John Mackey and publisher Steve Forbes to Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Partys nominee for president. When the festival first began in 2002, some 850 people attended. Last year, there were 2,400. Festival founder and economist Mark Skousen will tell you this is a sign, albeit a small one, that libertarianism  or something an awful lot like it  is surging. It is a rebirth, said Skousen, and a reaction to a feeling shared by many that America has moved too far afield from its founding principles. This country was established for the very thing that were fighting right now: excessive government control of our lives. In todays world everything is either prohibited or mandated.  You have to have medical insurance. You have to wear a seat belt.  They have to pat you down (at the airport). Skousen has a simple analogy for all of this: If you restrict a teenager, they rebel. I think thats what people are feeling. Libertarian at its essence means an advocate of the doctrine of free will and individual liberty. Or, as the Libertarian Party states on the banner of its website: Minimum Government, Maximum Freedom. Just how many Americans actually endorse the philosophy has never been easy to measure. The Libertarian Party claims some 250,000 registered voters among the more than 235 million voting-age Americans. While there are few capital L Libertarians, many others clearly have libertarian-like views that favor a fiscally conservative, socially tolerant way of governing. The philosophy  religious freedom, self-governance, a representative democracy that responds to the will of the people instead of ruling over the people  has been a part of the fabric of America since the 13 colonies waged a war for political independence from Britain. The American political culture from the beginning, and certainly at the time of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, was what would be called libertarian, said John Samples, director of the Center for Representative Government at the libertarian think-tank Cato Institute. That is: It was concerned about limiting government; it was concerned about individual liberty. The American West, and Nevada especially, has long embodied those tenets  whether in the independent spirit that pervaded the frontier or, later, in the tenacious fights with the federal government over property rights and land that became known as the Sagebrush Rebellion. The Libertarian Party itself was formed in Colorado in 1971 by a small group of citizens fed up with the two major political parties. They were compelled not only by their opposition to the Vietnam War but also President Richard Nixons imposition of a wage and price freeze on Americas free-market economy as a way to combat inflation. In its annual governance survey conducted last fall, Gallup found that a record-high 81 percent of Americans were dissatisfied with the way the country was being governed. There were increases, too, in the responses to questions that gauge a more libertarian-view of governance: A record 49 percent said they believed government posed an immediate threat to the rights and freedoms of ordinary citizens; 57 percent believed the federal government had too much power; and 56 percent said they would be willing to pay less in taxes and accept fewer services (a position advocated during the campaign by Paul). But do we really need numbers to confirm the strong libertarian-like streak running through the nation of late? Instead, just look to the rise of the tea party with its smaller-government, back-off mantra. Or take in some of the signs posted along U.S. roads these days, like this one outside of Wickenburg, Ariz.: Choose Freedom. Stop Obamacare. Or consider the backlash after New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed banning large servings of sugary sodas. The libertarian message is especially attractive to younger Americans who are war-weary, socially liberal and skeptical of government interference in their lives. Theyve grown up paying into Medicare and Social Security but hearing  endlessly  that theyre unlikely to receive the benefits of those programs. They see many government initiatives as unnecessary evils, and believe social issues such as abortion and gay marriage are matters of personal choice not political debate. Many pondered why Ron Paul, at 76 years old, attracted throngs of 20-somethings to his rallies and, according to exit polls, consistently won the 18-29 age bracket early in primary season in states such as New Hampshire and Iowa. Twenty-six-year-old Alexander McCobin has a response for that: This is the most libertarian generation thats ever existed, and its because libertarianism is just correct. Four years ago, McCobin co-founded the group Students For Liberty, which now has some 780 affiliates. He was first turned on to the philosophy in ninth grade when his father gave him a copy of the Ayn Rand novel Atlas Shrugged, the story of a fictionalized United States on the brink of collapse amid economic depression brought on by increasing government interference and regulations. At 18, McCobin registered with the Libertarian Party. He plans to vote for Johnson come November, though he believes the outcome of any single presidential race is far less important than spreading the message of libertarianism. Ever since the original Bush bailouts and then Obamas program and everything being done by both the Republicans and Democrats to grow government, its starting to open a lot of eyes, said McCobin, a doctorate student in philosophy at Georgetown. Theyre looking for an alternative narrative for whats going on in the world and realizing that libertarianism provides an explanation for whats happening  and a solution to it. Certainly none of this means that Americans are rushing en masse to change their party affiliation. But it does make for some interesting questions about how this mindset might exhibit itself in the presidential election, especially if the race between President Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney is a squeaker. In a 2010 paper, Cato concluded that libertarians are increasingly a swing vote  a bigger share of the electorate than the much discussed `soccer moms of the 1990s or `NASCAR dads of the early 2000s, and bigger than many of the micro-targeted groups pursued by political strategists in the 2004 and 2008 elections. Many of these voters would describe themselves as independents, a group that both candidates desperately need in order to win, said Samples. The libertarian view of limited government and free market economics usually pushes these voters toward Republican candidates, even if their social views are more in line with the Democratic Party. But as the Cato study pointed out, such voters are not firmly committed to either of the two major parties. It noted that during the George W. Bush years, libertarian-minded individuals moved away from the GOP in response to ongoing wars, government spending and social conservatism, but they returned in 2008 because they believed Obama was a big-government liberal. Samples thinks the 2012 election will look much like 2008. The unknown, of course, is Johnson, who is working to ensure his name is also on the ballot in all 50 states. Paul supporters may very well desert the GOP for Johnson, especially in Western states where the former two-term New Mexico governor is better known. A June poll in the swing state of Colorado showed Johnson garnering 7 percent support, mostly coming from potential Romney backers. Brian Doherty, a senior editor at the libertarian magazine Reason and author of a new book about Ron Paul, predicts that most Paul supporters wont vote at all for a presidential candidate, which doesnt mean theyre disengaging but that they wont give their support to someone they dont believe in 100 percent. He and others take the position of McCobin  that the election itself is far less important than effecting lasting philosophical change over policy and politics. Big L Libertarians hope their party will be the vehicle for that, and activists such as Wayne Root  the partys 2008 vice presidential nominee  are looking to bring more people into the fold by emphasizing fiscal policy over more controversial libertarian issues such as decriminalization of marijuana. Root writes a libertarian blog from his home outside of Las Vegas and calls himself a commonsense suburban Libertarian who supports home-schooling, low taxes and personal freedom (a la legalized online gambling). He is looking to make his own run for president in 2016 or 2020. A longtime Vegas oddsmaker, Roots prediction is the American public will be ready for a viable third-party candidate sooner rather than later. Whats that old saying? First they mock you, then they imitate you and then they become you, he said. And thats how I feel about libertarianism. For others  all of those Ron Paul backers, in particular  the means to an end is working within the Republican Party to fundamentally transform it, quieting cultural conservatives and emphasizing instead a message of fiscal responsibility and social tolerance that could attract new blood. In Nevada, that translated into so-called Paulists winning seats first to several county GOP committees, then to the state Republican committee. Now both of the states representatives to the Republican National Committee are libertarian-leaning, as are 22 of the 28 delegates heading to the GOP convention in Tampa. Places like Maine, Minnesota and Iowa have followed that model. Ron Paul supporters are now a near-controlling majority of the Maine Republican Party, said Brent Tweed, 33, a nuclear engineer and self-described libertarian conservative who was elected a GOP convention delegate. Tweed started researching libertarianism in 2004 after growing disillusioned with the size of government under President Bush. He sees the movement growing in Maine and beyond. We will only get bigger and, eventually, we will win. Do I think its going to happen in five years or 10 years? No. But I think its inevitable, he said. People will be drawn to the freedom message. In Nevada, the Bunce brothers liken their efforts to training a farm team. Their goal is to get libertarian-minded politicians elected to county and state office, then to Congress and perhaps, one day, the White House. Not unlike the man they revere, they know that not so long ago they were considered on the fringe of politics in their state. Now they are inside players, controlling the infrastructure of the Republican Party at both the state level and in places like Clark County, Nevadas largest. To any remaining naysayers, they warn that this is neither a passing fad nor a Ron Paul phenomenon that will fade once hes gone from the scene. They see hope in other up-and-coming libertarian-leaning Republicans: Justin Amash, a Michigan congressman seeking re-election whom Reason magazine christened the next Ron Paul; Kurt Bills, a Minnesota state representative who is running for U.S. Senate; and, of course, Rand Paul. Everything weve done up to this point is based on ideas.  It carries on well past Congressman Paul, said Carl Bunce. Hopefully well start to bring more voters to bear into the Republican Party  all those apathetic voters that were like myself. When that happens, he said, our ideas of liberty and freedom will persist. , Pauline Arrillaga, a Phoenix-based national writer for The Associated Press, can be reached at features(at)ap.org. .]", "Date": "20120707", "Title": "[With freedom in fashion, is libertarianism back?]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/with-freedom-in-fashion-is-libertarianism-back/", "Author": "[Pauline Arrillaga]"}
{"Content": "[ To those intrigued by the Donald Trump frenzy or impressed by Carly Fiorinas performance Wednesday night, the message from the King County Republican Party is clear:, This presidential election is something to look forward to. In a packed banquet room set up for TV-watching at the Hyatt Regency in Bellevue, GOP supporters showed overwhelming support for Fiorina in the presidential debate. They cheered for the former business executives comments about former Florida Gov. Jeb Bushs pot use, for instance, and her ability to stand her ground against other debaters. How amazing would it be to have two women running against each other? asked Everett resident Vera Olson, referring to Democratic presumed front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton. The crowd found Trumps self-described humble comments extremely comedic. And though party supporters gave relatively meek applause for the remaining nine leading candidates throughout the CNN showdown, they said they appreciate the variety and believe this crop of presidential hopefuls is strong. When you have this many candidates, this much involvement so early on, it shows its a robust competition, said 570 KVI conservative radio host John Carlson, who helped host the Bellevue event. Sen. Rand Paul and Trump didnt win any popularity points with the crowd, and Sen. Marco Rubios performance, a favorite attendees said among young party supporters, followed Fiorinas top spot for support. Some Bellevue High School seniors  who will vote for the first time come November 2016  were among Wednesdays crowd and voiced frustration with the nights political jargon and candidates wide-sweeping statements. It could perpetuate the problem among their peers, the high-schoolers said, of following candidates like Trump simply because they recognize his name. They hear these superficial details from whatever pops up on Facebook, Linnea Uyeno said, and theyre not considering the facts, she said. King County Republican Chairman Lori Sotelo said its too early to gauge a real front-runner. In the last couple years, weve become a tent with very different and interesting candidates, she said. The candidates are getting their word out there, and well know more about whos on top around January and February.

{"Content": "[ Vice President Joe Biden and his associates have begun to explore a possible presidential campaign, an entry that would upend the Democratic field and deliver a threat to Hillary Rodham Clinton, say several people who have spoken to Biden or his closest advisers. Bidens advisers have started to contact Democratic leaders and donors who have not committed to Clinton or who have grown concerned about what they see as her increasingly visible vulnerabilities as a candidate. The conversations, often fielded by Bidens chief of staff, Steve Ricchetti, have taken place through phone calls and at lunches. In most cases, they have grown out of an outpouring of sympathy for Biden since the death of his son Beau, 46, in May.  New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd reported Saturday that Biden had been holding meetings at his residence, talking to friends, family and donors about jumping in to challenge Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two nominating states. One longtime Biden supporter said the vice president has been moved by his late sons desire for him to run. He was so close to Beau and it was so heartbreaking that, frankly, I thought initially he wouldnt have the heart, the supporter, Michael Thornton, a Boston lawyer, said. But Ive had indications that maybe he does want to  and, Thats what Beau would have wanted me to do. Bidens path, should he run, would not be easy. Clinton has enormous support among Democrats inspired by the idea of electing a woman as president, and her campaign has raised millions of dollars. Additionally, Biden, 72, has proved to be prone to embarrassing gaffes on the campaign trail, and he would also face the critical task of building a field operation. One Democrat with knowledge of the conversations described the outreach as a combination of donors and friends of Bidens wanting to prop up the vice president in his darkest hours, combined with recent polls showing Clintons support among independents declining, suggesting there could be a path to the nomination for the vice president. Dowd reported that as Beau Biden lay dying from brain cancer, he tried to make his father promise to run, saying the White House should not revert to the Clintons and that the country would be better off with Biden values. Bidens other son, Hunter, also encouraged him to run, she wrote. The support Biden has garnered speaks to growing concerns among Democrats that Clinton could lose in Iowa and New Hampshire, as the populist message of one of her opponents, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, draws swelling crowds. The reality is its going to be a tough, even-steven kind of race, and theres that moment a lot of party establishment would start exactly this kind of rumble: Is there anybody else?  said Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist. At the same time, the slow trickle of news about Clintons use of private email when she was secretary of state and the coming Benghazi hearings may be distracting some voters from the core message of her campaign: the need to lift the middle class. Its not that we dislike Hillary, its that we want to win the White House, said Richard Harpootlian, a lawyer and Democratic donor in Columbia, S.C. who met with Ricchetti before Beau Biden died. We have a better chance of doing that with somebody who is not going to have all the distractions of a Clinton campaign. A spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign declined to comment. In a July 30 Quinnipiac poll, 57 percent of voters said Clinton was not honest and trustworthy and 52 percent said she did not care about their needs or problems. The same poll showed Biden with his highest favorability rating  49 percent  in seven years, with 58 percent saying he is honest and trustworthy and 57 percent saying he cares about them. But Clintons numbers were still strong, especially among likely Democratic primary voters. The No. 1 thing voters want is a candidate who is honest and trustworthy, and the veep is leading in those polls, said William Pierce, executive director of Draft Biden, a super PAC that is trying to build enthusiasm for a possible candidacy. Confidants say they expect Biden to make something official by early September. Kendra Barkoff, a Biden spokeswoman, said: As the Biden family continues to go through this difficult time, the vice president is focused on his family and immersed in his work. A 2016 run would be the third time Biden, a longtime senator from Delaware, has sought the presidency, which friends say is his ultimate dream. His first campaign in 1988 ended in heartbreak after news reports that he plagiarized parts of a speech and exaggerated his academic record forced him to drop out. In 2008, he drew less than 1 percent of the vote in the Iowa caucuses and dropped out after making controversial comments about Barack Obama. Biden said he was the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean. Obama later chose Biden as his running mate. The president has been careful not to undermine or wholeheartedly endorse either his former secretary of state or his vice president. The president has said that the best political decision hes ever made in his career has been to ask Joe Biden to run as his vice president, Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman said last week. Ricchetti, a former White House aide in the Clinton administration who is now Bidens chief of staff, began talking to donors and supporters in the months before Beau Biden died. In recent weeks those talks, with local elected officials and party leaders, started again, mostly because well-wishers were calling to check on the Biden family. The talk inevitably drifted to 2016, and many of these Democrats urged Biden to seriously consider getting into the race, said people with knowledge of the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity. Ricchetti declined to comment.]", "Date": "20150801", "Title": "[Biden taking steps toward 2016 run, supporters say]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/biden-taking-steps-toward-2016-run-supporters-say/", "Author": "[Amy Chozick]"}
{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON  , Loretta Lynch, who was confirmed Thursday as attorney general, will meet with local police officers nationwide this summer as she tries to strike a new tone for the Justice Department amid a roiling controversy over the use of lethal force, aides said. Lynch, who will be the first African-American woman to hold the post, will replace Eric Holder, an ally of President Obama who has been the administrations most outspoken voice on issues of race relations and civil rights. His tenure made him a hero among many on the left but recently earned him scorn from some police groups that said he was too quick to criticize officers amid a spate of high-profile episodes of black men dying at the hands of white officers. Lynch, the daughter of a North Carolina civil-rights leader and a child of the segregated South, shares many of Holders liberal views but has signaled that she plans a different approach, particularly in the nationwide debate over police tactics. While Holder recently completed a tour of minority communities to discuss policing, Lynchs aides said that improving police morale and finding common ground between law enforcement and minority communities would be among her top priorities. Lorettas confirmation ensures that we are better positioned to keep our communities safe, keep our nation secure, and ensure that every American experiences justice under the law, Obama said. The Harvard-educated Lynch is expected to be sworn in Monday, according to the Justice Department. Thursdays vote came after weeks of a fractious debate, with Democrats increasingly incensed by the delay, which was longer than that for all but two other nominees for attorney general: Edwin Meese, who was nominated by President Reagan, and A. Mitchell Palmer, who was selected by President Wilson, according to the Congressional Research Service. Though no senators questioned her qualifications, some Republicans opposed her because she defended Obamas executive actions to give legal status to millions of immigrants.  Lynch was confirmed 56-43, with 10 Republicans voting for her, including Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. the majority leader, whose control of the Senate floor had helped cause the delay. The vote also had overtones for the 2016 elections. The Republican majority if it so chose could defeat this confirmation, said Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a Republican presidential candidate, who called Lynch lawless during a floor speech. After lecturing his colleagues about how unsuitable Lynch is, he skipped the vote to catch a plane to Dallas for a fundraiser for his presidential campaign. He was the only senator to miss the final vote. Lynchs aides said she has no immediate plans for major pronouncements and will instead focus on internal changes at the department. She wants to restructure her office to be more responsive to cybersecurity cases, much in the same way that officials restructured the office in response to terrorism after 9/11. She also has told Congress and Justice Department officials that she plans to do more to combat human trafficking. As the top federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, Lynch built one of the nations premier programs to fight that crime. Lynch, 55, comes to the job with decades of experience inside the Justice Department. Her deputy, Sally Yates, is also a career prosecutor and the former U.S. attorney in Atlanta. With the shortened timeline, that experience should serve them well, former Justice Department officials said. Born in Greensboro, N.C. Lynch is the daughter of a Baptist minister and a school librarian. She has said she draws inspiration from her fathers work in the civil-rights movement. But her friends and relatives said she has never viewed her job in government as one of a civil-rights advocate. Shes not an ideologue, Annette Gordon-Reed, a Harvard law professor and longtime friend, said recently. Shes not going to do things to please some wing. Shes not a caricature of anything. She is a prosecutor. Lynch has spoken about the need for police officers, because they have positions of power, to repair fractured relationships with minorities. But she has also described, in passionate and personal terms, how law enforcement is a force for good in minority neighborhoods. She really thinks the communities and the police officers have more in common than they realize, one adviser said. There may be more pressing matters. The section of the Patriot Act that allows the National Security Agency to seize the phone records of millions of Americans without any evidence of wrongdoing expires in June. Lynch, a supporter of that authority, may be called on to help persuade Congress to reauthorize that power under a compromise bill supported by the Obama administration. She also faces immediate decisions on the use of force by the police. Her office in Brooklyn is leading the investigation into the death of Eric Garner, who died after a police officer put him in a chokehold last year. And the Justice Departments civil-rights investigators are negotiating a settlement with Ferguson, Mo. over allegations of police misconduct there. Lynch is expected to be deeply involved in both those cases. She is not expected to push for changing marijuana laws. Under Holder, the Justice Department did not stand in the way of states that legalized marijuana. That was one of the few moments in which her confirmation hearing provided a glimpse at her priorities. Senators used much of the hearing to ask about her views on immigration or on other issues they considered important. Rarely was she asked what she considered important. One thing she did promise, however, was to improve the Justice Departments relationship with Congress, which has been strained during Holders tenure. The Republican-controlled House held Holder in contempt over his response to questions about the flawed gun-trafficking investigation known as Fast and Furious. Lynch told aides that she wants a better relationship with Congress and plans to meet with lawmakers regularly. Just as with police groups, Lynch told aides, a lot can be accomplished with a simple change in tone.]", "Date": "20150423", "Title": "[New attorney general plans shift in tone for Justice Department]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/new-attorney-general-plans-shift-in-tone-for-justice-department/", "Author": "[MATT APUZZO, JENNIFER STEINHAUER]"}
{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON  , Social Security turns 80 on Friday, and the massive retirement and disability program is showing its age. Social Securitys disability fund is projected to run dry next year. The retirement fund has enough money to pay full benefits until 2035. But once the fund is depleted, the shortfalls are projected to be enormous. The stakes are huge: Nearly 60million retirees, disabled workers, spouses and children get monthly Social Security payments, and that number is projected to grow to 90 million over the next two decades. And the timing is bad: Social Security faces these problems as fewer employers are offering traditional pensions, forcing older workers to think hard about how they will afford retirement. This is a program thats been immensely popular since it began, said Nancy LeaMond, executive vice president of AARP. Increasingly, people recognize that saving for retirement is becoming harder and harder, and Social Security is becoming even more important. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act on Aug. 14, 1935. Here are things to know about the federal governments largest program on its 80th birthday:, Social Securitys long-term financial problems are largely a result of demographic changes. Every day, about 10,000 people in the U.S. turn 65. These are the baby boomers. Typical boomers, however, didnt have as many children as their parents did. As a result, relatively fewer workers are left to pay the payroll taxes that support Social Security. In 1960, there were more than five workers for every person receiving Social Security. Today there are fewer than three. In 20 years, there will be about two workers for every person getting benefits. Americans are also living longer. In 1940, someone who was 65 could be expected to live about 14 more years, on average. Today, they can expect to live an additional 20 years, on average. Last year, Social Security paid benefits of nearly $850 billion  about a quarter of all federal spending. The average monthly payment is $1,221. That comes to about $14,700 a year. For most retirees, Social Security accounts for most of their income, according to the Social Security Administration. The trust fund that supports Social Securitys disability program is projected to run dry in late 2016  right in the middle of the presidential election. If Congress allows that to happen, it will trigger an automatic 19 percent cut in benefits to the 11 million people who receive Social Security disability. Lawmakers could redirect tax revenue from Social Securitys much bigger retirement program, as they have done in the past. If the tax revenue were redirected, the retirement fund would lose one year of solvency, so both the retirement program and the disability program would have enough money to pay full benefits until 2034. At that point, Social Security would collect enough in taxes to pay 79 percent of benefits. Republicans are balking at the fix. They see the funding crisis as an opportunity to improve a disability program that they believe is plagued by waste and abuse. Social Security retirement funds have been raided far too many times for far too many years, said Rep. Tom Reed, R-N.Y. Social Security uses a 75-year window to forecast its finances, so the projections cover the life expectancy of every worker paying into the system. Over the next 75 years, Social Security is projected to pay out $159 trillion more in benefits than it will collect in taxes, according to agency data. Thats not a typo. Adjusted for inflation, the shortfall comes to $35.3 trillion in 2015 dollars. Thats nearly twice the national debt, which took the entire federal government 239 years to accumulate. Yes. For much of the past three decades, Social Security produced big surpluses, collecting more in taxes than it paid in benefits. Social Security invested those surpluses in special U.S. Treasury bonds, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. They are now valued at $2.8trillion. But as Social Security was generating surpluses, the rest of the federal government was running deficits, for all but a few years around the turn of the century. To finance deficit spending, the Treasury borrowed from the public and from other federal programs, including Social Security. Yes. Social Security was on the brink of insolvency in the early 1980s when Congress and President Reagan agreed to gradually increase payroll taxes and to reduce benefits, in part by gradually raising the retirement age. Those changes didnt permanently fix Social Security, but they provided enough revenue to pay full benefits for about 50 years. In todays political climate, another feat like that would be historic.]", "Date": "20150813", "Title": "[Time for an overhaul?

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON  As debt jumped over the past decade, economists warned that retiring baby boomers might soon overwhelm retirement programs, swamp the federal budget and keep the debt unusually high as far as the eye can see. That day has come and the answer now apparently is get used to it. After years of debt that normally amounted to about a third of the nations total economy, it has spiked to more than 70 percent with no relief in sight. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office bases its estimate on current law, and it sees the debt levels approaching 80 percent in 2025. President Obamas proposed fiscal 2016 budget envisions the nations debt at 74 percent of the size of the U.S. economy in 10 years. But thats if he gets all the changes he wants, including large tax increases. Thats highly unlikely. Just eight years ago, this number was about 35 percent, about the historical average. The latest forecasts suggest Washington now expects debt held by the public to remain at levels twice the historical average for the foreseeable future. Dont lay all the blame on boomers for the U.S. debt, White House Budget Director Shaun Donovan voiced in early February what other politicians might well have thought. He likened the wave of retiring baby boomers  Americans born between 1946 and 1964  to the proverbial pig in a python that bulges inside the reptile as it is swallowed, digested and passed through. This demographic shift through the middle 2030s is a huge fiscal challenge to get through, and so what is sort of acceptable in the next 20 years is different from what might be acceptable long term, Donovan said. Got that?, It means they think high debt now is OK. The federal government will continue running deficits to pay for Medicare, Social Security and other programs that will be strained even more by the boomers retirement. The most immediate consequence is paying more interest, a lot more. In 10 years, the United States will pay about $827 billion in interest on the swelling debt. Thats almost four times what the government pays now. And by 2025, it will eclipse the $711 billion in projected spending for defense, as well as the $689 billion projected for all nondefense spending outside the entitlements such as Social Security. Under President George W. Bush, the debt rose from $3.4 trillion in 2000 to $5.8 trillion in 2008, fighting two wars without raising taxes to pay for either and actually lowering taxes. Bush began emergency spending to deal with the Great Recession, and that continued under Obama. Debt went from $7.5 trillion in 2009 to $12.6 trillion in 2014. And all this spending happened right before the first boomers began hitting official retirement age in 2008. We were entering into a fiscally challenging time, and the Great Recession added to it and made it more difficult, said Robert Bixby, head of the budget watchdog group Concord Coalition. If you go back to 2007, nobody would have been talking about (debt equal to) 74 percent of GDP as the new norm. Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman is among the few unconcerned. In a Feb. 2 New York Times column, he said the economy was too weak to fix long-term imbalances and applauded Obamas proposals to boost spending. In todays economic and political environment, long-termism is a cop-out, a dodge, a way to avoid sticking your neck out, Krugman charged. And its refreshing to see signs that Mr. Obama is willing to break with the long-termers and focus on the here and now. That irked Alice Rivlin, a former vice chair of the Federal Reserve and the first director of the Congressional Budget Office, in 1975. She noted recently that the debt as a share of the economy has tripled since 1975, when it was 24 percent. I dont care what Paul Krugman says, that disturbs me, Rivlin said. Aside from crowding out government and military spending, high debt leaves the nation vulnerable if theres a future natural disaster, terror attack or financial crisis. Theres less room to issue more government bonds without buyers demanding a higher rate of return to offset default risk. That in turn would make it even more costly to borrow to pay off past bills. You have another big shock, and it just ratchets up again, Bixby said. The trend line is for it to go up on autopilot because of the structural deficit we have in our fiscal policy. As a liberal think-tank economist, Jason Furman criticized the mounting debt and deficits of the Bush administration. Now Obamas head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, he argues against focusing on the debt number. What we had set from the very beginning of this administration as our fiscal goal was getting the deficit under 3 percent of GDP. That wasnt picked as some arbitrary number, Furman said. That was picked because thats where you need to be in order to have your debt falling as a share of the economy. We look more at the trajectory and ask ourselves is it sustainable for the economy. The difference between what the government spends and what it takes in  the deficit  fell by about 70 percent in Obamas first six years, and was equal to 2.8 percent of the size of the overall economy in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. The CBO sees it returning to 3 percent in 2019 and 4 percent in 2025, the White House 2.5 percent in 2025. The number that I would focus on is where we are relative to the historical average on the deficit, insisted Furman, noting its now the 40-year average. Either way, this will be a challenge in the 2016 elections, especially anyone repeating the White House pig in a python to explain away the elevated debt. Said Bixby: I think that would be a tough message on the campaign trail  We have higher debt, live with it. ]", "Date": "20150308", "Title": "[Crush of retired baby boomers to keep U.S. debt high for years]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/crush-of-retired-baby-boomers-to-keep-us-debt-high-for-years/", "Author": "[Kevin G.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON  As presidential candidates find new ways to exploit secret donations from tax-exempt groups, hobbled IRS regulators appear certain to delay trying to curb widespread abuses at nonprofits until after the 2016 election. In a shift from past elections, at least eight Republican presidential candidates, including leading contenders like Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, have aligned with nonprofit groups set up to raise hundreds of millions of dollars. Hillary Rodham Clintons supporters are considering a similar tactic. Some of these groups are already planning political initiatives, including a $1 million advertising campaign about Iran by a tax-exempt group supporting Rubio. The groups are able to carry out many of the same political activities as candidates and their affiliated super PACs, but do not have to disclose where they get their money, allowing total anonymity for donors. While the nonprofit groups are supposed to limit their political activity, the IRS appears powerless to stop the onslaught of money coursing through them. The tax agency remains deeply wounded by the scandal that began two years ago over its scrutiny of nonprofits tied to the tea party and other political causes, both conservative and liberal. Its anything goes for the next couple of years, said Paul Streckfus, a former nonprofit specialist at the IRS who now edits a newsletter on tax-exempt groups. The whole system has really collapsed. Under an exemption established more than a century ago, the nonprofit groups  known as 501(c)(4) organizations for the section of the tax code that created them  are supposed to be devoted to social welfare, with an aim to further the common good and general welfare of the people of the community. But there is disagreement over just how much politicking they can do. IRS officials concede that the rules are vague and difficult to enforce. Audits for excessive campaign work are extremely rare, even for groups spending huge chunks of their budgets to support candidates. Complaints about abuses can languish for years, records show. With scant enforcement, some nonprofits have become huge political operations. Groups tied to the Republican strategist Karl Rove and the industrialist brothers Charles and David Koch have emerged as major political forces.]", "Date": "20150705", "Title": "[IRS unlikely to hit nonprofit-donor abuses in 2016]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/irs-unlikely-to-hit-nonprofit-donor-abuses-in-2016/", "Author": "[ERIC LICHTBLAU]"}
{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON  Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton are fighting back against critics as if they are waging another campaign, the clearest sign yet that, perhaps, they are. The former secretary of state and her former president husband are defending their records, showing off their health and humor and raising money for fellow Democrats, fresh indications that Hillary Clinton has her eye on running for president in 2016. The onetime first lady was attending her first political event of the year on Thursday, a New York fundraiser for Pennsylvania congressional candidate Marjorie Margolies, who is the mother-in-law of the Clintons daughter, Chelsea. The former president has been a steady rainmaker for Democrats this year, raising money for candidates from Arkansas to Florida, Kentucky, Michigan and Maryland. Confronting Republican critics, the Clintons responded with humor and heft to suggestions by Republican strategist Karl Rove that Hillary Clinton may have suffered health problems more serious than she acknowledged after a concussion and hospitalization in late 2012. The former president mused Wednesday that Roves doubt-casting on Hillary Clintons health could be a sign of more attacks to come. You cant be too upset about it, its just the beginning. Theyll get better and better at it, Clinton said. Its just part of the deal. Clinton vouched for his wifes good health. Rove disputed reports that he suggested Hillary Clinton suffered a brain injury but said her health would be relevant if she runs again in 2016. His comments brought a stinging rebuke from Mrs. Clintons advisers, the type of response common in a presidential campaign but unusual since Mrs. Clinton left the Obama administration last year. They are scared of what she has achieved and what she has to offer, said Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill. Former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a Clinton supporter, said Roves comments were an attempt to dissuade Hillary from becoming a candidate but said the Clinton response should not imply that Hillary Clinton had made any decisions. Hillarys people are doing all these things with a hope that she will become a candidate. This is what a candidate should be doing in the early stages, but I dont necessarily think that means shes decided yet, Rendell said. Republicans have signaled that they will raise the former first ladys health and age  she would turn 69 about a week before the 2016 election  and her record at the State Department, including her handling of the 2012 terrorist attack on a diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador. On Capitol Hill, Republicans offered another reminder Thursday of how they will maintain a steady drumbeat on the Benghazi attacks. Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. and Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H. renewed a call for a joint select committee, which Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid has rejected. They suggested weakness over Clintons decision to skip a round of Sunday talk shows five days after the Sept. 11, 2012, attack and allow then-United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice to take her place. What does that say about Benghazi and her leadership ability? Graham asked reporters at a news conference. Clinton is expected to tell her side of the Benghazi story next month, when her new book, Hard Choices, is released. She has offered a preview in recent speeches, describing her work with Obama to curb Irans nuclear ambitions, lay the foundation for Middle East peace and help Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng. Bill Clinton, meanwhile, has sought to remind people of his administrations economic record. During a recent Georgetown University speech, he pointed to his creation of nearly 23 million jobs. More immediately, the Clintons are helping Margolies, a former Pennsylvania congresswoman, leading up to her May 20 primary for a House seat in the Philadelphia suburbs. Hillary Clintons event for Margolies was being held at the New York home of Lynn Forester de Rothschild, a major donor for her 2008 campaign. Bill Clinton, meanwhile, is appearing in a television ad for Margolies, vouching for her as someone who will make you proud. The former president on Tuesday helped rake in $1 million at a Potomac, Md. campaign fundraiser for Maryland Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, who hopes to succeed outgoing Gov. Martin OMalley, D-Md. Clinton has appeared at fundraisers for Alison Lundergan Grimes, a Kentucky Democrat challenging Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, and longtime allies like Mike Ross, who is running for Arkansas governor, the office that launched Clinton to the White House. The former president will headline the Ohio Democratic Partys annual gala on June 13, raising money in one of the nations premiere presidential battleground states. _]", "Date": "20140515", "Title": "[Bill and Hillary fight back against critics with humor, records]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/bill-and-hillary-fight-back-against-critics-with-humor-records/", "Author": "[KEN THOMAS]"}
{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON  Hillary Rodham Clinton opened her 2016 presidential campaign with a road trip to Iowa as Republican hopefuls, vying to be the one to face her if she wins the Democratic nomination, got an early and aggressive start taking her on. A van nicknamed Scooby and driven by the Secret Service was crossing a 1,000-mile swath of the country Monday from Clintons home in the New York City suburbs, setting the stage for a community college appearance the next morning and more campaign events in a state where she ran third in the 2008 caucuses. Clinton announced her bid for the Democratic nomination in a video Sunday, then hit the road. Already the GOP is treating her as the Democratic nominee. Announcing his own 2016 campaign to top donors Monday, Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio branded the former first lady, senator and secretary of state as a leader from yesterday who wants to take us back to yesterday. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, another declared candidate, put Clinton at the center of his first TV ad, titled Liberty, not Hillary. Prospective candidates piled on, too. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker criticized Clintons Washington-knows-best mentality in tweets. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush derided the Obama-Clinton foreign policy in a video message. While there are serious policy differences among the dozen or so major Republicans considering a run for president, they appear to have all concluded theres little downside in starting early on Clinton. Even former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the partys 2012 nominee, couldnt resist, saying on Fox News Sunday that shes a creature of Washington and just not trustworthy. The road trip was Clintons idea, aides said. Longtime adviser Huma Abedin, in a conference call with Clinton alumni, said Clintons van stopped at a gas station in Pennsylvania, where she met a family from Michigan. She was expected to reach Iowa later in the day. Rubios team was initially concerned that Clintons announcement and activities would overshadow his splashy rally Monday evening thats expected to kick off his 2016 campaign. But they concluded the almost overlapping events would draw a contrast between Rubio, the 43-year-old senator, and Clinton, who is almost 25 years his senior. Its a calculus that didnt occur, or didnt matter, to Clinton. Her video, shared hundreds of thousands of times in the first hour after being posted online, said nothing about anyone else in the 2016 race. An old Clinton rival from Arkansas who is also considering a run for president, former Gov. Mike Huckabee, predicted her silence wont last. Anyone who thinks that shes going to get into this halfheartedly, well, theyve never ever encountered the will, the spirit, the heart and the determination of the Clinton political machinery, he said on ABCs This Week. Bush tapped supporters with a fundraising appeal to help him stop Clintons liberal agenda. Paul started selling Hillarys Hard Drive on his website, a not-so-subtle reference to Clintons use of a personal email account and server while serving as secretary of state. The Republican National Committee and conservative groups are in the anti-Clinton fray, too. At least 10 political organizations list defeating Clinton as their primary mission in their filings with the Federal Election Commission, and Democrats say theyre preparing to face much as $500 million worth of attack ads during the 2016 election. On Monday, the Republican National Committee said its Stop Hillary ad was shown repeatedly on all the major networks. Its campaign will continue this week with plans to distribute #StopHillary beer Koozies at the Washington Nationals baseball game. Ninety-eight percent of our focus has been on Hillary for the last year, said Sean Spicer, chief strategist and communications director of the committee.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON  In 2012, Antonio Weiss took his 15-year-old son, Nico, from the gilded aerie of their Manhattan apartment on Central Park West to Cleveland to canvass for President Obamas re-election. Weiss, 48, was also the co-author of a white paper calling for higher taxes on the rich and has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Democratic Party. Yet in his Wall Street provenance, Weiss, Obamas nominee to be undersecretary of the Treasury for domestic finance, has given the left an unlikely rallying cry to press for a more aggressively liberal economic policy agenda. It is not Weiss politics that are in question. It is his rsum. I have voted for people who have extensive Wall Street experience, said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. She is rallying the opposition to Weiss, head of investment banking at Lazard, a storied but relatively small firm. But, she said, the Antonio Weiss nomination is a mistake, and thats why Im fighting back. The formal confirmation process, while not likely to get under way until after the new Congress convenes next year, has become an unexpected proxy war between the liberal and moderate wings of the Democratic Party. Its outcome will say a lot about the partys direction as it regroups for the 2016 presidential campaign, in which Hillary Rodham Clinton will be under pressure to discard some of her ties to Wall Street. At Lazard, Weiss was involved in a number of international megamergers, including a deal that allowed Burger King to acquire the Canadian chain Tim Hortons in a maneuver that gave the combined company a lower tax liability in the United States. And in doing so, he made a lot of money. Weiss assets are worth between $54 million and $203 million, according to his financial disclosure. In addition to his Manhattan apartment, he owns a 200-year-old, eight-bedroom farmhouse in Connecticut and property in the Dominican Republic valued at up to $1 million. To Warren and her allies, Weiss nomination was proof that their anti-Wall Street views are still getting no respect within the Obama administration. While they managed to derail Obamas moves to nominate Lawrence Summers, his former Treasury secretary and economic adviser, as chairman of the Federal Reserve, they say Weiss confirmation by the Senate would send the wrong signal about whether Democrats can advance the economic prospects of the struggling middle class. The American people are profoundly disappointed with the fraud they read about every day coming from Wall Street, said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. who is considering running for president as a Democrat to encourage the party to move to the left. They are disgusted that instead of investing in the American economy, they are busy trying to avoid paying their fair share of taxes, and the American people want people in the Treasury Department who are prepared to hold Wall Street accountable. Supporters of Weiss, both inside and outside the Obama administration, see the brewing fight as no less consequential. Wall Street executives lend the Treasury Department real-world expertise to understand how policy proposals might be gamed by the banks and investment houses they are aimed at.  Weiss defenders say he is being caricatured as a rapacious banker when he is more Daddy Warbucks than Gordon Gekko. He combines financial expertise with a liberal outlook and an intellectual panache that led to his becoming publisher of The Paris Review. Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, a Democratic research and advocacy group, recalled Weiss working on an economic policy paper for her organization that called for sharply higher taxes on the wealthy, an overhaul of the corporate tax code that would raise revenue for deficit reduction and changes to the individual tax code to make it more progressive. Weiss declined to comment for this article, citing his pending confirmation hearings. The particulars of Weiss background and policy views appear to matter far less than the optics. Weiss spent years in Paris as vice chairman of European investment banking at Lazard, then rose to global head of mergers and acquisitions. His deal making has included this years merger of tobacco giants Reynolds American and Lorillard, Berkshire Hathaways swallowing of H.J. Heinz last year, Googles 2011 takeover of Motorola Mobility and InBevs takeover of Anheuser-Busch in 2008. No deal is causing more trouble than Burger Kings inversion merger with Tim Hortons, which came just as the Treasury was proposing new rules to stop U.S. companies from reincorporating as foreign entities not subject to U.S. taxes. Lazard itself gave up its U.S. citizenship in 2005 to reincorporate in Bermuda, using a loophole the Bush administration later closed to deter copycats. Beyond Lazard, there is Weiss himself. To defenders like Tanden, his years in Europe made him acutely aware of the perils of wage stagnation and the obstacles to upward mobility. He grew up in New York, in a distinctly middle-class family. Both of his parents were teachers. He attended Yale and Harvard Business School, while also apprenticing under George Plimpton, the editor of The Paris Review. Where supporters see brio, detractors see a fat cat. Last week, the AFL-CIO president, Richard Trumka, sent a letter to Lazards compensation committee chairman, Philip Laskawy, via the companys Bermuda affiliate, questioning his decision to speed the vesting of equity income to ease Weisss transition to public service. If he is confirmed as the undersecretary, Weiss will receive $6 million to $30 million in stock that would normally accrue to him in 2017 and $3 million in interest income, according to the Project on Government Oversight. But beyond that is the Warren wings belief that Democrats must realign their economic policies with the interests of working-class voters, particularly white men without college degrees, who have flocked to the Republican Party in recent years. ]", "Date": "20141207", "Title": "[Left-wing war over Wall Street nominee to Treasury post]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/business/left-wing-war-over-wall-street-nominee-to-treasury-post/", "Author": "[Jonathan Weisman]"}
{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON  In a stairway just off the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, Rep. Ami Bera walks past a portrait nearly every day of the late Rep. Dalip Singh Saund, a Democrat from California elected in 1956 and the first Indian American  in fact, the first Asian American  to serve in Congress. While their ranks in Congress have not swollen, Indian Americans have been making political inroads, from city councils to state capitols. One is even flirting with running for president. We certainly are looking at how to get Indian Americans more engaged in politics, said Bera, a Sacramento County physician and the sole Indian American in Congress. They should think about running for office. Seattle City Councilmember Kshama Sawant, the Indian-born former computer engineer and community-college instructor who knocked off incumbent Richard Conlin in 2013 under the banner of the Socialist Alternative Party, has rapidly become one of the councils most influential members. Sawant, 42, grew up middle class in Mumbai with a civil-engineer father and a schoolteacher mother, and later earned a Ph.D. in economics from North Carolina State University. Meanwhile, Indian-American activist Pramila Jayapal became the first Indian immigrant elected to the Washington Legislature in November. Asian Americans, which include Indian Americans, are the fastest-growing demographic group in the United States, according to the Pew Research Center. Nearly 600,000 of the countrys 3.1 million Indian Americans live in California, including a number of notable elected officials. Besides Bera, who was born in Los Angeles to immigrant parents, they include California Attorney General Kamala Harris, who could become the first Indian American elected to the U.S. Senate. Ash Kalra, a member of the San Jose City Council, is running to become the first Indian American elected to the California legislature. The longer the Indian-American community has been in this country, the more it has matured, Kalra said. And part of that maturity is becoming more politically active. Bera, who has endorsed Harris to succeed retiring Democrat Barbara Boxer, could be joined in the House next year by Kumar Barve, former majority leader of the Maryland House of Delegates. Barve is running for the House seat of Rep. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat who is a candidate for the Senate seat of another retiring Democrat, Barbara Mikulski. Barve said he won his first election with hardly any Indian-American votes. Even today, Asian Americans account for only 8 percent of the population of the congressional district he seeks to represent. We have to prove ourselves to a very diverse electorate, which I think makes stronger elected officials, he said. Though Americans of Indian descent account for only 0.1 percent of the U.S. population, they are the most affluent and best educated of any immigrant group in the country, according to Pew. They lean strongly toward Democrats, yet two Republican governors, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Nikki Haley of South Carolina, are of Indian descent. They include doctors, engineers, tech entrepreneurs and educators, and form a rich donor base. However, Indian Americans are more spread out than other ethnic groups, and Indian-American candidates in expensive races often have to go out of state to raise money. Harris will have to seek contributions to run in California, which has some of the costliest media markets in the country. Asian Americans could be crucial to her campaign. When it comes to political contributions, that aspect of her identity will become important, said Karthick Ramakrishnan, associate dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of California, Riverside. Having a large concentration of Indian Americans in your state or district doesnt always translate to victory, nor does a lack of Indian or Asian-American voters mean defeat. Technology lawyer Ro Khanna, a Democrat who was born in Philadelphia, ran last year in Californias 17th Congressional District. It is home to about 100,000 Indian Americans, more than any other House district in the country. It encompasses much of Silicon Valley, and Khanna leveraged the deep pockets of the tech sector. Though he outspent incumbent Democrat Mike Honda, he lost a close race. Indian Americans are only 2.4 percent of the population in Californias 7th Congressional District, where Bera has won twice, though narrowly. He did so last year in challenging political terrain: a district whose party registration is evenly divided, a midterm election with low turnout and against a Republican, Doug Ose, who had been elected to Congress before. James Lai, director of the ethnic studies program at Santa Clara University, said Beras success involved focusing on issues important to the district, including jobs and the economy, health care and education. Harris will likely run on her accomplishments as state attorney general. Any successful candidate of Asian descent will have to run as kind of a mainstream candidate, Lai said. You always have to go to your constituency. A Pew Research Center report last year found that 65percent of Indian Americans identified as Democrats or leaned toward the party, the highest level of affiliation among Asian-American groups. Asian Americans generally have trended away from the Republican Party in the past two decades, and that trend includes Vietnamese Americans, a group once reliably Republican. The partys stance on immigration is a major factor, political observers say, as well as security policies enacted after 9/11 that increased racial profiling. The Republican Party has a long way to go with Asian Americans, Lai said. Republicans Haley and Jindal succeeded by aligning themselves with their states largely white, conservative electorates. Both have twice been elected governor of their states. Jindal, who previously served in Congress, is considering running for president in 2016. Last year, former U.S. Treasury Department official Neel Kashkari, a Republican who worked for President George W. Bush, defeated a tea-party favorite in Californias Republican primary for governor. Still, in a year that favored Republicans almost everywhere else in the country, he lost by a wide margin to three-term Gov. Jerry Brown. It could be a very different outcome for Harris, the twice-elected state attorney general widely considered the front-runner in the California Senate race. Harris, whose mother is Indian American and whose father is Jamaican American, would be the first Asian or black American elected to the Senate from California. She is running in a presidential-election year, which means higher voter turnout overall and more Democrats coming to the polls. Her candidacy showcases the diversity in the Asian-American community and has generated a lot of excitement, said UC Riversides Ramakrishnan, whos extensively studied Asian-American voters and candidates. Shes a formidable candidate who has a lot of support in many communities, not just Asian Americans, he said.]", "Date": "20150405", "Title": "[Indian Americans on rise in local, national politics]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/indian-americans-on-rise-in-local-national-politics/", "Author": "[Curtis Tate]"}
{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON  In recent months, Harold Ickes, a longtime ally of Hillary Rodham Clinton, has helped organize private meetings around the country with union leaders, Clinton backers and Democratic strategists. The pressing topic: Who will step up to be the Democrats megadonors in the 2016 presidential race?, Republican contenders already have hundreds of millions of dollars in commitments from a stable of billionaires, including a Wall Street hedge-fund executive, a Las Vegas casino magnate, a Florida auto dealer, a Wyoming investor and, of course, Kansas-born billionaires David and Charles Koch. But none of the biggest Democratic donors from past elections  for example, Chicago investor Fred Eychaner, climate-change activist Tom Steyer and entertainment mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg  have committed to supporting Clinton on nearly the same scale. No one has stepped forward as the savior, said Matt Bennett, a longtime Democratic consultant. The leading super PAC backing Clinton, Priorities USA Action, has won commitments of only about $15million, Democrats involved with the group said. And while the lack of a competitive race for the Democratic nomination gives Clinton time to catch up with GOP rivals, her allies plan to push the partys wealthiest donors for more money than most have ever given. In planning sessions and one-on-one meetings with donors, Ickes, who is a Priorities USA board member, and other Clinton supporters are discussing how to raise up to $300million for Democratic outside groups. That is almost twice as much as Democratic super PACs and other outside groups spent to help re-elect President Obama in 2012, when conservative super PACs far outspent liberal ones. This ambitious goal will require the emergence of a new class of at least 20 Democratic donors who can give $5million or even $10million each. Ickes said recruiting them would not be easy. Our side isnt used to being asked for that kind of money, Ickes said. If you asked them to put up $100million for a hospital wing, theyd be the first in line. The hurdles begin with the candidate. While Clinton has committed to meeting with potential super PAC donors, people close to her say she has not dealt with the kind of big-donor courting that has framed the early months of the Republican race. She is also navigating the rules on what a candidate may do to help super PACs, which, since the Supreme Courts Citizens United decision in 2010, can raise unlimited funds from individuals and corporations but may not coordinate with candidates. Fearful of violating the rules, Clinton plans to limit her direct appeals to donors. Those appeals also threaten to undercut her message on the corrupting influence of unchecked money in politics. She has called for repealing Citizens United and has said that changing the countrys campaign-finance system to get unaccountable money out of it once and for all would be among her top priorities as president. Clinton also faces a perception that neither she nor her husband, former President Bill Clinton, is lacking cash. Together, they earned at least $30million in the past 16 months. And Bill Clintons aggressive courting of donors, in the White House and now as head of the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, has been an enduring source of controversy. A bigger problem, Democratic fundraisers and super PAC officials acknowledge, is that they are out of practice. The peak for donations to Democratic outside groups was 2004, when hedge-fund billionaire George Soros and insurance executive Peter Lewis poured close to $40million into groups opposing President George W. Bush. The groups collected almost $200million. There will definitely be some sticker shock, said Michael Vachon, a political adviser to Soros. Ted Cruzs super PAC raised $30million in a few weeks, Vachon added, and he has no more chance of being president than I have. The conservative network overseen by the Kochs, composed largely of nonprofit groups that do not reveal their donors, is planning to raise $889million for its political and philanthropic efforts through 2016. Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino developer who spent $93million in 2012 to support GOP candidates, is likely to invest a similar sum this time. Robert Mercer, a hedge-fund executive, has helped bankroll super PACs supporting Cruz, a Texas senator. Norman Braman, a billionaire Miami auto dealer, plans to spend $10million or more to support Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. Foster Friess, a mutual-fund investor in Wyoming who spent more than $2million in 2012 on Rick Santorums White House bid, is supporting him again this time.]", "Date": "20150530", "Title": "[Democrats need richer donor list to keep up with GOP]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/democrats-need-richer-donor-list-to-keep-up-with-gop/", "Author": "[ERIC LICHTBLAUand NICHOLAS CONFESSORE]"}
{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON  It took Ted Cruz three months to raise $10 million for his campaign for president, a springtime sprint of $1,000-a-plate dinners, hundreds of handshakes and a stream of emails asking supporters to chip in a few bucks. One check, from one donor, topped those results. New York hedge-fund magnate Robert Mercers $11 million gift to a group backing the Texas Republicans White House bid put him atop a tiny group of millionaires and billionaires whose contributions dwarf those made by the tens of thousands of people who have given to their favorite presidential candidate. An analysis of fundraising reports filed with federal regulators through Friday found that nearly 60 donations of $1 million or more accounted for about one-third of the more than $380 million brought in so far for the 2016 presidential election. Donors who gave at least $100,000 account for about half of all donations to candidates presidential committees and the super PACs that support them. The review covered contributions to outside groups that can accept checks of any size, known as super PACs, and to the formal campaigns, which are limited to accepting no more than $2,700 per donor. The tally includes donations from individuals, corporations and other organizations reflected in data filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) as of Friday, the deadline for super PACs to report for the first six months of the year. That concentration of money from a small group of wealthy donors builds on a trend that began in 2012, the first presidential contest after a series of court rulings and regulatory steps that created the super PAC. They can openly support candidates but may not directly coordinate their actions with their campaigns. We have never seen an election like this, in which the wealthiest people in America are dominating the financing of the presidential election and as a consequence are creating enormous debts and obligations from the candidates who are receiving this financial support, said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a Washington, D.C.-based group that wants to limit money in politics. Others see an up side to the rainmakers. Big money gives us more competitive elections by helping many more candidates spread their message, said David Keating, director of the Center for Competitive Politics, which advocates for fewer campaign finance limits. Many say their contributions, which the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized as equivalent to free speech, merely reflect their intense belief in a particular candidate  and in the political system in general. Id think that the fact that Im willing to spend money in the public square rather than buying myself a toy would be considered a good thing, said Scott Banister, a Silicon Valley investor who gave $1.2 million to a super PAC helping Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul in the Republican presidential race. The voters still, at the end of the day, make the decision, he said. While the existence of high-dollar donors is more pronounced on the Republican side, theyre also among those giving to the super PAC backing Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton. Seven donors of at least $1 million accounted for almost half the total collected by Priorities USA Action. Entertainment mogul Haim Saban and his wife, Cheryl, led with a $2 million gift, and hedge-fund billionaire George Soros, historically one of the Democratic Partys biggest givers, donated $1 million. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker are too new to the presidential contest, announcing only weeks ago, to have filed any reports about their campaigns finances. Yet super PACs that sprang up months ago to support them show their efforts will be financially viable: A group backing Christie raised $11 million, while two supporting Walker brought in $26 million. Such totals put them well ahead of Paul, former technology executive Carly Fiorina, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Sen. Rick Santorum, who began their presidential campaigns in the spring. Cruzs super PACs, meanwhile, didnt just get the $11 million from Mercer. They also received $10 million from Toby Neugebauer, an energy investor in Texas, while the Texas-based Wilks family pooled together a $15 million gift.]", "Date": "20150801", "Title": "[Small pool of rich donors dominates presidential-election giving]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/small-pool-of-rich-donors-dominates-presidential-election-giving/", "Author": "[Julie Bykowicz, JACK GILLUM]"}
{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON  Most U.S. presidential candidates really dont want to spend nearly two years bowing and scraping to voters and campaign donors. Most voters sure dont want to hear about the presidential race for anywhere near that long. Why, then, does it take so loooong to pick a U.S. president? Blame American-style democracy?, Blame the pollsters and consultants who feed off the horse race. Blame the unquenchable thirst for campaign cash. If youre a candidate, blame other candidates for forcing you to get going so early. Whatever the reason, 20 months out from the November 2016 presidential election, no fewer than two dozen potential candidates are maneuvering to run, and theyre already elbowing one another for advantage. Candidates are hiring staff members, donors are taking sides, party operatives are digging up dirt on potential opponents, and activist groups are holding straw polls of dubious value. Contrast that with the rest of the world. Israelis will spend about four months picking their next prime minister. In India, the formal campaign season for national elections was even shorter last year. In Canada, federal elections typically last about five weeks, although political positioning starts earlier. A look at why this exercise in democracy is so drawn out in the U.S.:, American presidents serve for a set four-year term. Future contenders start planning for the next election years in advance, with no limits on what they can spend in the primaries and often no limits in the general election. Thats different from many parliamentary democracies, in which elections may be called without much notice and where there are limits on paid advertising and spending. The U.S. system is particularly complex. Candidates compete in a maze of state caucuses and primaries to get their partys nominations, then orchestrate summer party nominating conventions before competing head-to-head in the fall general election. Its a hard thing to figure out, and its not something you do quickly, says Tom Rath, a GOP activist in New Hampshire, the first primary state on the political calendar. Any hope of dominating in the primaries requires months of advance work to lock up supporters in the states. That requires even earlier work to attract key staffers and raise the money needed for a strong campaign. This period sometimes is called the invisible primary. Campaigns last so long because we have something called the First Amendment, which means that you cant do what other democracies do, which is to say the campaign will only last for five weeks, or that you cant campaign except in the last five weeks and you cant advertise, says former Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee in 1988. If someone wants to start in Iowa six years ahead of time, you cant stop them. It used to be that pollsters and consultants went all-out during campaigns, then took off to do other things during a period of governing before the next election season, says Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute, a longtime observer of politics and author of The Permanent Campaign and Its Future. But starting in the 1980s and into the 1990s, he says, the pollsters and the campaign consultants werent melting away. They were sticking around. The end of one election is quickly followed by planning for the next. The midterm congressional elections are seen as an informal kickoff for the presidential race. Its kind of a symbiotic relationship involving consultants, pollsters and candidates eager to get out ahead of everybody else, says Ornstein. As the cost of U.S. campaigns goes up, the quest for campaign cash  and the desire to impress outside groups flush with their own money  starts earlier and earlier. The private Center for Responsive Politics estimates that candidates, parties and independent interest groups put $2.6 billion into the 2012 presidential race and $2.8 billion into the 2008 race, when there was no incumbent running. Those numbers compare with $1.9 billion in 2004 and $1.4 billion in 2000. Everybody is motivated to move a little bit earlier, says Ornstein. And the flood of outside money adds to the pressure to have enough inside money that you can at least be credible to get some of that outside money backing you, or to counter it if you dont have it. Even though candidates often would rather wait to begin a campaign, not a single politician dares risk being left behind. Once one candidate starts moving, others feel compelled to follow. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bushs declaration in December that he actively would explore the possibility of running injected momentum into the whole Republican field. In addition, many candidates opt for a breakthrough strategy, settling in to a particular state early in hopes of surprising observers by doing well someplace unexpected. As a consequence, we look ever further out into the future for a set of tea leaves we can trust, says New Hampshires Rath. It gets late very quickly in this game. In the leadoff caucus state of Iowa, Republican activist Doug Gross is ready to do his part. Were electing the most powerful person in the world, says Gross, and we probably ought to at least do a pretty good job interview so we know what were getting before we vote for them.]", "Date": "20150308", "Title": "[Why the 2016 presidential race is off to such an early start]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/news/why-the-2016-presidential-race-is-off-to-such-an-early-start/", "Author": "[NANCY BENAC]"}
{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON  President Obama isnt expected to get the federal minimum-wage increase hes wanted anytime soon, but advocates hope that public support for the issue gets a boost from an unusual set of states this Election Day. Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota  four solid-red states whose voters often oppose the presidents agenda  might be next to raise the wage floor of Americas lowest-paid hourly workers. On Nov. 4, they will vote on ballot measures to increase their minimum wages. Some advocates hope that victories on the ballot, especially in four Republican strongholds, will change the national narrative of the economic debate. It becomes a lot harder for members of Congress who might not support these kinds of things to continually say no when it comes up in Washington (D.C.), said Josh Levin, a vice president at the left-leaning Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, which supports activists on state ballot measures. States have already been busy on the minimum wage this year. Ten state legislatures and the District of Columbia have raised their minimum wages in 2014, according to the bipartisan National Conference of State Legislatures. However, the legislation mostly passed in blue states such as Vermont, Massachusetts and Hawaii. Only one of those 10 states, West Virginia, voted for Republican Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election. The issue has gained a lot of attention this year. Earlier this month, fast-food workers across the country participated in a strike in favor of a $15-per-hour livable wage, more than double the current federal floor of $7.25. The Seattle City Council passed a $15 hourly rate in June, which will be phased in, and some activists are pushing that figure elsewhere in Washington state. The ballot measures in Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota would bring about much smaller increases. But that doesnt bother Steve Copley, chairman of the Give Arkansas a Raise Now coalition. Every penny that somebody who is working hard can get helps, Copley said. Activists must be realistic about what increases they push for at the polls, said Peggy Shorey, the director of state government relations at the AFL-CIO, whose state federations support the ballot initiatives. Arkansas is not the same as Seattle, she said. The current $6.25-per-hour state minimum wage makes Arkansas one of three states lower than the federal floor for hourly wages. Only Georgia and Wyoming are lower, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. (When state minimum wages differ from the federal rate, the higher rate is adhered to in that particular state, as employers dont want to violate federal law.), Last year, about 91,000 workers earned the federal minimum wage or below  employees who earn tips, for example  in the four states with November ballot proposals, according to the Labor Departments Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, thousands more would be affected as the state wage floors rose gradually. While all four initiatives would begin wage increases Jan. 1, the approaches are split on their long-term considerations of how to link the minimum wage to cost-of-living increases. Under Alaskas ballot proposal, the minimum wage would be tied to increases in the Anchorage Consumer Price Index caused by inflation starting in 2017. South Dakotas initiative would raise the minimum wage based on changes to a national CPI metric starting in 2016. Tying annual increases to CPI fluctuations is controversial. Opponents in South Dakota say its one of their biggest concerns of the ballot proposal there. The economies in Florida, California and New Jersey are going to dictate how employers in our state are going to have to do (wage) increases every year, said Shawn Lyons, the executive director of the South Dakota Retailers Association, a wage-hike opponent. Ten states, including Florida and Washington, have minimum wages legally tied to CPI metrics, according to the Department of Labor. New Jersey will join them in January, with the District of Columbia, Minnesota and Michigan scheduled to follow suit in upcoming years. Copley said such a measure in Arkansas would have been a nonstarter at the polls. We didnt feel like we could get it passed, he said. Instead, the minimum hourly rates would top off at $8.50 per hour in 2017 in Arkansas and $9 per hour in 2016 in Nebraska under their ballot proposals. Illinois, considered a left-leaning state, is holding a vote in November on raising its $8.25 minimum hourly wage to $10, but the advisory referendum is nonbinding and doesnt carry the weight of law. Republican state Sen. Kyle McCarter sees that as election-year political maneuvering. The Dems are loading the ballot with referendums that mean nothing, just so they can get their traditional supporters out to the polls to vote for them, he told the Belleville News-Democrat in May. Former Alaska labor commissioner Ed Flanagan, whos a wage-hike advocate, said the Alaska campaign had benefited from a grass-roots union presence. At 23.1 percent of the states wage and salary workers, Alaskas union membership rate is more than double the national rate, according to BLS data. Some minimum-wage-hike opponents think the getting-out-the-vote effect of the ballot proposals is a one-way street. Nebraska Taxpayers for Freedom President Doug Kagan said the minimum-wage ballot proposal was unlikely to excite voters on his side of the debate. The minimum-wage issue is more important to the Democratic voters than to the Republican voters in Nebraska, said Kagan, whose conservative group opposes raising the state minimum wage. Our polls would indicate we have a lot of work to do to educate people on some of our concerns, said Michael Held, a lobbyist with the South Dakota Farm Bureau, which opposes that states proposal. In August, 58 percent of surveyed potential Alaska voters supported the state initiative there, according to Public Policy Polling, a Democratic polling firm. A poll by the Arkansas publication Talk Business and Hendrix College found in April that 79 percent of surveyed Arkansas voters supported their states ballot initiative. Five Southern states  South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama  have no state minimum wage at all, deferring to the federal rate.]", "Date": "20140924", "Title": "[Labor activists look for wage-hike support from red states]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/labor-activists-look-for-wage-hike-support-from-red-states/", "Author": "[Daniel Salazar]"}
{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON  Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorinas decision to release two years of tax returns did more than reveal the former Hewlett-Packard chief executives $59 million fortune: The longshot contenders move won her props for transparency and, more important, increased pressure on other 2016 contenders to follow suit. Fiorinas attention-getting move last week has the potential for being a game-changer. Joseph Thorndike, a historian and author who studies the political economy of American taxation, cant recall any other major candidate who has revealed so much about personal finances this early in the campaign cycle. Not so coincidentally, Fiorinas disclosure comes at a time Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton has been under fire for the complexity of her familys financial arrangements. Candidates for federal office and elected officials are legally required to file personal financial disclosures with the Federal Election Commission to let the public know about any potential conflicts of interest. But the forms are notoriously vague (filers list their assets and liabilities in broad categories of value, rather than precise dollar amounts) and loophole-ridden (spousal income, while included, can prove difficult to parse, and home values dont have to be included). Over the years, many candidates for office  usually those with modest incomes and wealthy opponents  have chosen to go the extra mile by releasing tax returns. Fiorina stands out because she voluntarily listed her considerable holdings in exact dollar amounts without being pressured to do so. Theres no law compelling disclosure but theres a lot of moral pressure we place on candidates, Thorndike noted. Richard Nixon was the first president to release his tax returns (while under investigation), Thorndike added, after which it became standard practice for presidents and, increasingly, candidates. As reported by The Wall Street Journal, Fiorina and her husband have a net worth of $59 million, making her one of the wealthiest candidates in the race so far. According to their 2013 tax return, the Fiorinas earned nearly $2 million that year, placing them among the highest earners in the top 1 percent of the population. They reported $1.3 million in income for 2012. In 2012 and 2013, they paid an effective tax rate of 30 percent, according to the Fiorina campaign. They also gave an average of 14 percent of their income to charity in those years, the campaign said. Fiorina and her husband, Frank, a retired AT&T executive, filed an extension on their 2014 tax return. No one enjoys turning over private documents for public scrutiny, and candidates often drop out of a presidential race before making such disclosures or wait until as late as possible before offering up the intimate details of their financial lives. In 2012, Mitt Romney faced mounting pressure to disclose his returns from Republican rivals and Democrats before he buckled and released two years worth. The reason for his stall was readily apparent: The returns provided ammunition for the Obama campaign, and its allies proceeded to hammer the wealthy former private-equity executive for paying a lower effective tax rate (roughly 14 percent) than many middle-class Americans. The returns served to bolster the presidents narrative about Romney as member of a wealthy elite that helps itself to upper-end tax breaks. A former Romney campaign spokesman confirmed that the pressure to release the returns eventually became too much. We had Harry Reid lying on the floor of the Senate about Mitt Romney not paying taxes. And the press corps continued to push for the returns. It was a distraction for the campaign, said Ryan Williams. Compared to the federally mandated personal financial-disclosure forms, tax returns shed more light on how certain policies might affect the candidate, said Dan Auble, a senior researcher at the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Especially for the wealthy, whose finances tend to be more complicated, the tax return can provide context that informs debate. He noted that tax returns include information that personal financial-disclosure forms do not, such as tax deductions used by the candidate, charitable giving and real-estate loans. That may be cause some heartburn for wealthy longtime politicians like Clinton and Republican Jeb Bush  both of whom have released tax returns in the past but both of whom are believed to have become significantly wealthier since their last disclosures. Between his first 1998 and 2002 gubernatorial races, Bush disclosed 20 years of returns. In 2002, his tax return revealed a nosedive in income once he took office. Now hes been out of office for decades and has reportedly made millions serving on corporate boards and giving speeches. Clinton released seven years of tax returns during her 2008 run for the White House (in addition to more dating back to Bill Clintons tenure as governor of Arkansas). But she hasnt released any since she became secretary of state in 2009; her more recent tax returns will surely generate interest given the recent spotlight on the mammoth speaker fees that she and her husband have been able to command since leaving office, turning them from a couple who was dead broke, as Hillary Clinton controversially put it, upon leaving the White House, into multimillionaires. There are a variety of reasons candidates may not want to release their tax returns. For instance, people whove had a lot of sophisticated tax advice about how to minimize their taxes might not want that on display for everyone to see, Thorndike said. Anything that seems unusual to regular voters. Most of us have nothing close to that. Other candidates who have made their returns public include Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who released five years worth of taxes in 2012, when he was running for the Senate; Rubio, who released nine years of returns during his 2010 Senate run; former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who disclosed his taxes from 1987 to 2010; and former New York Gov. George Pataki, who last released his returns in 1994. I believe that every serious candidate will release their tax returns, said Thorndike. Dave Levinthal, of the Center for Public Integrity, said the politics of tax returns arent always earthshaking.

And Chris Christie says the ultrasound of his first daughter changed his views on abortion. If they seem to be reading from the same script, they are. With help from a well-funded, well-researched and invigorated anti-abortion movement, Republican politicians have refined how they are talking about pregnancy and abortion rights, choosing their words in a way they hope puts Democrats on the defensive. The goal, social conservatives say, is to shift the debate away from the war on women paradigm that has proved so harmful to their partys image. Democrats were jolted by the latest and perhaps most disruptive effort yet in this line of attack by activists who want to outlaw abortion: surreptitiously recorded video of Planned Parenthood doctors casually discussing how they extract tissue from aborted fetuses. It took Hillary Rodham Clinton several days to respond to the uproar the videos created. When she finally did late last week, she called the videos part of a deliberate and concerted attack on womens rights, and pointed back to Planned Parenthood, which she said had already apologized for the tone of one of the doctors who were recorded. It is unclear whether the new offensive will succeed in crippling Planned Parenthood, a provider of across-the-board womens health services that has long been a target of conservatives for the hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding it receives. Democrats like Clinton have, so far, not wavered. But with the presidential campaign revving up, Democrats and abortion-rights supporters are bracing for a sustained, sophisticated and coordinated effort to force a debate on the uncomfortable moral and ethical questions that abortion raises. The out-of-sight, out-of-mind mantra that propelled the pro-choice movement for decades is forever gone, said Kellyanne Conway, a Republican pollster who has been hired by conservative candidates, anti-abortion groups and the Republican National Committee to help conservatives sharpen their message on the issue. Conway has advised Republicans, especially men, to describe their recollections of seeing ultrasound images for the first time because it can be disarming. Coincidentally or not, many of the partys presidential contenders did so in New Orleans this month at a gathering of the National Right to Life Committee. Planned Parenthood is now struggling to explain a legal aspect of its practice that has gone largely unnoticed  procuring tissues from aborted fetuses for medical research  in a crisis that shows no signs of abating. Cecile Richards, the groups president, told ABC News on Sunday, Planned Parenthood has broken no laws. She said the activists responsible were from the most militant wing of the anti-abortion movement in this country and were seeking to entrap doctors. The activist behind the videos, David Daleiden, has said he has enough covertly recorded footage for perhaps a dozen videos that he could release, one a week, for the next few months. Planned Parenthood has told Congress that it believes the next installments could have a racial element to them, with its employees possibly discussing the different characteristics of the extracted fetal tissue based on race. The group also says it knows that Daleiden or his colleagues were admitted into a clinic area that processes tissue after abortions, and it believes they may have obtained footage of that as well. The tactics could backfire if people perceive them as extreme and dishonest. Democrats have already begun making this case, saying the footage was edited in a misleading way. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said last week that the videos were selectively edited to distort not just the words of the individual speaking, but also the position of Planned Parenthood. Not shown in the videos is the doctors insistence that they would not profit from tissue donation, which is illegal, and that their motivation for collecting donated tissue was scientific, not financial. But anti-abortion activists say their new efforts are forcing their opponents to defend their own words and beliefs on the issue in a way they had not had to before. Its very difficult to deliver a message that people dont basically believe, said Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the Susan B. Anthony List, a group that funds anti-abortion candidates. Were the source of the information, so they think were biased. But in this case, she added, its coming from them, not us. Abortion opponents hope the videos will provoke people to consider the humanity of the unborn, much like discussing ultrasounds can  albeit in a much more jarring and graphic way. Conway, the Republican pollster, calls this a shock the conscience, warm the heart approach. Daleidens approach shows how the movements tactics have evolved. He and his fellow activists took the time to study an aspect of Planned Parenthoods practice that was largely unknown to outsiders. And they trained extensively  learning the correct terminology and financial information  to give the false impression that they were professionals. The images and language that advocates use are intended to portray the Democratic Partys official position on abortion, particularly its support for late-term abortions, as extreme  a label that has stuck much more effectively to Republicans on issues of womens reproductive health. The potential for the issue to be a factor in the 2016 presidential election is real. All the Republican candidates who are now in the upper tier strongly oppose abortion rights, unlike in 2008 and 2012, when social conservatives found Rudolph Giuliani and Mitt Romney to be untrustworthy because they previously supported liberal abortion laws. The Supreme Court, which many experts expect to take up a major abortion case next term, could bring the issue to the fore and keep it there well into 2016. At some point, too, the Senate will take up a bill that would ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. All four of the Republican presidential candidates in the Senate  Ted Cruz of Texas, Paul of Kentucky, Rubio of Florida and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina  support it. The release of the Planned Parenthood videos, meanwhile, has set off a new push by congressional Republicans to cut the groups funding. That could come to a boil this year, shortly before the first presidential primaries. Democrats often relish legislative fights over abortion, because Republicans often stumble by making ill-advised statements, like the legitimate rape remarks that damaged the party so badly in the summer of 2012, months before the presidential election. Social conservatives say they hope the missteps and overreach are a thing of the past. Those of us whove grown up in the movement have learned a lot, said Jeanne Mancini, the president of the March for Life, an annual event on the National Mall. She said, for example, that her group now discourages participants in the march from using the disturbing images of abortion that so often appear at rallies and protests. Instead, she said, it encourages a softer approach, like posters with pictures of babies.]", "Date": "20150726", "Title": "[GOP candidates following scripted message on abortion, pregnancy]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation-politics/gop-candidates-following-scripted-message-on-abortion-pregnancy/", "Author": "[JEREMY W.

Kirk, who faces a tough re-election in 2016, is no stranger to oral kerfuffles. This spring, he was criticized for saying black neighborhoods of Illinois are the ones we drive faster through. He was trying to explain the need for economic development and touting his ideas for that and his anti-gang policies to help poor neighborhoods, but some criticized the remarks as racially insensitive. Earlier, he sparked commentary when he had compared the abortion debate to slavery.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON  Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had a heart stent implanted Wednesday, reviving talk about how long the 81-year-old liberal jurist will be staying on the court. She was expected back at work Monday, but her hospitalization  three weeks after elections handed Republicans control of the Senate  raised anew the question of whether President Obama would be able to appoint a like-minded replacement. The situation sends many, particularly on the left of the political spectrum, into a tizzy, said Jonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University Law School. Ginsburgs procedure came after a blockage was discovered in her right coronary artery, said court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg. The justice was taken to the hospital by ambulance at about 10 p.m. Tuesday after she experienced discomfort during routine exercise at the court with her personal trainer, Arberg said. The justice was expected to leave the hospital within 48 hours. Ginsburg, who leads the courts liberal wing, has for years been fending off questions about whether she should retire and give a Democratic president a chance to name her successor. She underwent operations for colorectal cancer in 1999 and for pancreatic cancer in 2009, was hospitalized after a bad reaction to medicine in 2009 and suffered broken ribs in a fall two years ago. But the courts oldest justice has not missed any time on the job since President Clinton appointed her in 1993. For several years, liberal academics have been calling on Ginsburg and, to a lesser extent, Justice Stephen Breyer, 76, to step down to ensure that Obama could nominate a younger justice with similar views. Lawyers who are close to the Obama administration have made the same argument, but more quietly. In one sense, its already too late for that, since the Senate will be in Republican hands come January, making confirmation more difficult. Turley said that while some liberals had been urging Ginsburg to leave before the GOPs midterm election gains: I doubt seriously that anyone would want to face a vacancy in this political environment, certainly not those on the left of the political spectrum. Still, the picture would look worse for the Democrats if a Republican should win the presidential election in 2016. A retirement then by a liberal justice would allow the appointment of a more conservative justice and potentially flip the outcome in important 5-4 decisions in death-penalty, abortion-rights and gay-rights cases in which the liberal side sometimes prevails. The decision to leave the pinnacle of the legal world never is easy, even for justices with health problems. Chief Justice William Rehnquist remained even as he was treated for thyroid cancer. He died in September 2005, still chief justice. Rehnquists death allowed President George W. Bush to nominate another conservative, John Roberts, the current chief justice. The Roberts court has five justices appointed by Republican presidents and four appointed by Democrats. Ginsburg has repeatedly rebuffed suggestions that its time to step down. She remains one of the courts fastest writers, and she has continued to make frequent public appearances. So who do you think could be nominated now that would get through the Senate that you would rather see on the court than me? she said in an Associated Press interview in July. And as for the next presidential election, she has said on more than one occasion: I am hopeful about 2016. In 2005, Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, 78, said nothing publicly when he had a stent inserted to keep an artery open after experiencing mild chest pain. The court revealed the procedure when he returned to the hospital to have the stent replaced ten months later. Stents are mesh scaffoldings inserted into about 500,000 people in the United States each year to prop open arteries clogged by years of cholesterol buildup. Doctors guide a narrow tube through a blood vessel in the groin or an arm, inflate a tiny balloon to flatten the blockage, and then push the stent into place.]", "Date": "20141126", "Title": "[Supreme Court Justice Ginsburg gets heart stent at 81]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/supreme-court-justice-ginsburg-gets-heart-stent-at-81/", "Author": "[SAM HANANEL, MARK SHERMAN]"}
{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON  The gun-control movement, blocked in Congress and facing mounting losses in federal elections, is tweaking its name, refining its goals and using the same-sex marriage movement as a model to take the fight to voters on the state level. After a victory in November on a Washington state ballot measure that will require broader background checks on gun buyers, groups that promote gun regulations are turning their attention  and their growing wallets  to other states that allow ballot measures. An initiative seeking stricter background checks for certain purchasers has qualified for the 2016 ballot in Nevada, where such a law was passed last year by the Legislature and then vetoed by the governor. Advocates of gun safety  the term many now use instead of gun control  also are seeking spots on ballots in Arizona, Maine and Oregon. I cant recall ballot initiatives focused on gun policy, said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. There wasnt the money. Colorado and Oregon approved ballot measures on background checks at gun shows after the Columbine school massacre in 1999, but the movement stalled after that. The National Rifle Association (NRA), which raises millions of dollars a year largely from small donors and has one of the most muscular state-lobbying apparatuses in the country, is attuned to its foes shift in focus. We will be wherever they are to challenge them, said Andrew Arulanandam, the groups spokesman. The new focus on ballot initiatives comes after setbacks in Congress and in statehouses. After the 2012 massacre of schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn. President Obamas effort to pass a background-check measure never got out of the Democratic-controlled Senate. Although 10 states have passed major gun-control legislation, not only in Connecticut and New York but also Colorado, more states have loosened gun restrictions. Candidates who backed gun control mostly lost in the midterm elections, even after groups spent millions on their behalf. The last setback came in December, when Martha McSally, a Republican, prevailed in a razor-thin recount over a Democratic incumbent, Rep. Ron Barber of Arizona. Barber was wounded in the 2011 shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, and lost even though Giffords PAC, Americans For Responsible Solutions, spent more than $2 million in the race. Message recast, Gun-control groups say that although they are dwarfed by the NRA, they have more money and are involved in more grass-roots activism than ever before. The NRA was heavily outspent in the Washington state referendum. The advocacy groups have recast their cause as a public-health and safety movement, and are homing in on areas where polling has shown voter support, such as expanded background checks and keeping guns out of the hands of people with domestic-violence convictions, restraining orders or mental illnesses. Some of those provisions have gained steam even in heavily Republican-controlled state governments, such as those in Louisiana and Wisconsin. Things that people feel are most doable politically right now are connected to domestic violence, Webster said. There is a lot of uptick on that issue even in red states and states with a lot of guns. In the past two years, 11 states have passed such legislation. Closing loopholes on background checks for gun owners is an area Americans support far more than steps such as curbs on assault weapons or limits on magazine sizes. A recent Pew survey showed that 52 percent of respondents said they believed it was more important to protect gun-ownership rights. That figure was up from 29 percent in 2000. Still, in a 2013 poll, Pew found that nearly 75 percent of respondents supported background-check expansions. Gun-control advocates believe that ensuring background checks for the majority of gun buyers is the foundation of all other existing laws. The reason voters support these laws is the same reason the movement supports these laws, said Laura Cutilletta, a senior lawyer for the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. The same-sex marriage movement has been a model for advocates of new gun restrictions. As with gay marriage, background-check expansions enjoy far broader public support in polls than among elected officials, and they affect state residents immediately. The arc of the marriage-equality movement started in the federal government, and got them the Defense of Marriage Act, said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, the gun-control group backed by Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City. Then they went to the states and showed that if you can get the majority of the public on your side state by state, that will influence the courts and Congress in the end. Refighting the battle, Last month, Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, which has been the source of many illegally obtained guns in other states, proposed the restoration of the states limit on handgun sales to one a month to slow the iron highway, a nickname for gunrunning up Interstate 95 to states to the north. He would also seek mandatory background checks on gun sales at firearm shows, and end issuing gun permits to anyone restrained under domestic-violence orders of protection. I own three guns, said McAuliffe, a Democrat. I love to take my three boys hunting. This is not gun restriction, this is anti-crime. I couch it in economic terms. The prospects for his gun proposals did not look great out of the gate. The governor knows refighting the one-gun-a-month battle will not be productive, Thomas Norment Jr. the Republican majority leader of the Virginia Legislature, said in a statement. For gun-control groups, money is not the problem it was only recently. Contested ballot-initiative programs cost between $5 million and $15 million, said Pia Carusone, a senior adviser to Giffords group. You will see heavy hitters; money isnt a problem, she said. The group has raised about $30 million for all political activities, including the Washington state initiative, in the past two years. Bloomberg has spent millions of dollars on everything from research to political campaigns to the Washington referendum and is prepared to continue to do so. Gun-rights groups plan to meet them head-on. The terrain gets a lot harder for him, Arulanandam, the NRA spokesman, said of Bloomberg. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence  along with other advocacy groups  is evaluating which states among the 17 that allow ballot initiatives are the best spots to pick for the next fight; Maine, Arizona and Oregon, should their legislatures not take action, are widely viewed as the three with the most potential for gun-control advocates. In Washington, those who pushed the ballot measure through say they will begin a campaign to get the Legislature to pass measures to keep guns from those with mental illnesses, children and people with a record of domestic violence. Opponents of gun control, for their part, went to the courts this week to challenge the new background-check requirements. As with the same-sex marriage movement  and efforts by some conservative groups to weaken labor unions and to make abortions more difficult to obtain  the efforts of gun-rights advocates and advocates for gun restrictions demonstrate a fading faith that legislative remedies are to be found in Congress. Whether its on guns or immigration or tax reform, clearly Washington (D.C.) is broken, Feinblatt said.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON  U.S. Sen. Patty Murray is one of the most forceful advocates in Congress for Americans perched on the middle rung of the economic ladder or lower. So its been an open secret for months that Murray hoped to swap her chairmanship of the Senate Budget Committee to succeed retiring Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa when he relinquished the gavel of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, which has wide jurisdiction on issues affecting working-class families. When the 114th Congress begins Jan. 6, Murray will take over Harkins committee seat. But thanks to the November elections, she will be the ranking Democrat, not chairwoman. That likely will make it even harder for Murray to make progress on her priorities, many of which Republicans oppose on fiscal or ideological grounds. Among them are expanding access to taxpayer-funded preschools, raising the minimum wage and restoring contraceptive coverage under the Affordable Care Act that was stripped out by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling. The reality we know is that we now have a Republican-controlled Senate and House, Murray said in a recent interview, acknowledging dim prospects for passage of contentious issues. That doesnt mean Im not going to fight for it. Murrays best shot at an accord in the HELP committee might be reauthorizing the elementary- and secondary-education law signed by President George W. Bush called No Child Left Behind. The law, which has been awaiting renewal since 2007, mandated testing to ensure that every public-school student in the nation was performing at grade level on math and English by the 2013-14 academic year. Currently, fewer than 50 percent of American students meet that benchmark. Consequently, the U.S. Department of Education has granted waivers from the federal law to virtually every state. Washington state received, then lost, the exemption this April after legislators failed to abide by a condition to incorporate student test scores into teacher evaluations. Murray said shes hopeful she can help forge a compromise education act with Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the incoming HELP committee chairman. Working in their favor, Murray said, is that congressional Democrats and Republicans all agree its a broken law. Murray is a former preschool teacher and PTA president who served on the Shoreline School District board of directors. Alexander is a son of a high-school principal and a preschool teacher and  was secretary of education under President George H.W. Bush. Yet Murray and Alexander will have to bridge a deep partisan divide on how much say  if any  the federal government ought to have  in securing every child a good public education. In 2013, the Republican-led House and the Democrat-controlled Senate HELP committee passed competing education bills almost entirely along party lines. Alexander objected to the Senate bill as creating a national school board. Neither party, however, has proposed overturning the current requirement for annual standardized testing in grades three to eight and testing once in high school. Relying on test scores as a proxy for teacher quality remains controversial among some educators and their unions. Diane Ravitch, former undersecretary of education under Alexander who later turned against testing, said No Child Left Behind made the federal government an arbiter of school quality and has been a disaster. Today there is a tremendous and growing anti-testing movement in every state in this nation, said Ravitch, research professor of education at New York University. Murray and Alexander should eliminate the federal role in overtesting students. Murray defended standardized testing, saying it has a critical role to play in gauging student learning and helping teachers assess if what they are doing is right. Nonetheless, Murray believes testing for accountability can go too far. The suspected test tampering at Seattles Beacon Hill International School, Murray said, could be an example of how overzealous reliance on testing sometimes backfires. Seattle Public Schools this summer invalidated Beacon Hill students scores on state tests after discovering excessive erasures that converted wrong answers into correct ones. In Seattle, high test scores can earn principals thousands of dollars in bonuses and qualify teachers for higher-paying positions as mentors for their peers. The district is hoping a handwriting expert can finger who was responsible for the alterations. Inflexible and unrealistically high standards for test scores, Murray said, can create such tremendous pressure that the outcomes could be things like what were seeing at Beacon Hill. Murray conceded it would be difficult to secure federal spending for one of her chief ambitions, universal preschool. Seattle voters in November approved higher property taxes to pay for city-subsidized preschool, and New York City this year began offering free, full-day classes for 4-year-olds. But there is a huge hole at the federal level, said Murray, who believes early-childhood education is a necessary investment for a competitive global economy. Murray also said she would seek advice on how to advance a bill introduced by Harkin and other Democrats last year to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 an hour by 2016. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in February estimated that could cost jobs for 500,000 low-wage workers as employers cut back. That would be offset by $31 billion in higher earnings by 2016, for a net gain of $2 billion in real income. That economic argument still wasnt enough for Democrats to get the minimum-wage bill passed in this Congress, said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C. Despite a push by Murray and her Democratic colleagues, Congress this year also did not renew extended unemployment benefits for people out of work for more than six months, said Bernstein, former economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON  With only 8percent of salaried workers currently covered by overtime rules, Sen. Patty Murray says its time for the federal government to intervene. After becoming the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee in January, the senator from Washington state is among the leading backers of a White House plan to expand overtime pay for nearly 5 million Americans. It could mean raises for 90,000 workers in her home state. Murray faces resistance from retailers who fear that higher pay would force them to cut jobs and reduce work hours. She counters that the overtime rules are outdated, doing little to help workers who are routinely assigned to longer hours. It would mean a lot of money in peoples pockets, and what it basically means is youre going to get paid for the work that you do, Murray said in an interview Tuesday. In the mid-1970s, Murray said, 62 percent of the American workforce was covered by overtime rules, but that number has been in steady decline. Under federal law, hourly employees are guaranteed overtime pay for working more than 40 hours per week, receiving at least 1 times their regular rate of pay. But the rules limit overtime pay for salaried workers to those who earn less than $23,660 per year. Under the White House plan announced earlier this month by President Obama, that threshold would more than double, to $50,440. Murray said shes confident that the new rule will take effect after the Department of Labor seeks comment on the proposal. Murray said the only way it can be blocked is if Congress intervenes. Even then, she said, Obama could use his veto power to prevail. This is something that is going to happen, Murray said. So far, the proposal isnt causing much of a fuss in Washington state. The Washington Retail Association, based in Olympia, said it had not yet decided how to react, while Amazon, the Seattle-based Internet retail giant, did not respond to a request for comment. In Washington, D.C. its a much different story. In a statement, the National Retail Federation, the nations largest retail trade association, called the plan an attempt to build the middle class by government mandate. There simply isnt any magic pot of money that lets employers pay more just because the government says so, said David French, the groups senior vice president for government relations. And House Republicans, anticipating the White House move, called a hearing on the plan in June, nearly a month before Obama announced the proposed change. Rather than providing more opportunities for individuals to earn overtime pay, it appears that the new regulations will only result in a more complicated law, requiring outside legal advice for small businesses, and more litigation, said Jamie Richardson, White Castles vice president of government and shareholder relations, testifying before the House Subcommittee on Workforce Protections. Despite the opposition, Murray said the plan will boost the economy by helping people spend more. If they get that additional money for working more, theyre going to have more in their pockets to take their kids out for pizza or to buy them another pair of shoes for school or to perhaps save for their college, she said. The issue is just one of many pro-labor plans on Murrays plate this year, after she replaced former Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin as the ranking Democrat on the Health, Education and Pensions Committee. Murray called it a rewarding assignment. While she has gained much attention for overhauling the No Child Left Behind schools law, she has also used her new perch to promote a series of labor issues. Among them:,  Shes the chief sponsor of the Raise the Wage Act, which would increase the federal minimum wage to $12 by 2020.  Shes the lead Senate Democrat on The Healthy Families Act, which would require employers to provide up to seven paid sick days per year. It would apply to companies with more 15 employees.  She teamed up with Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, to introduce a bill aimed at giving workers more predictability in their work schedules. It would require retail, food service and cleaning employees to receive work schedules at least two weeks in advance, or one hours worth of extra pay for schedules changed with less than a 24-hour notice.  She has pushed to close the wage gap between men and women working the same jobs. And she released a report showing the challenges women face in retirement, with a poverty rate nearly double that of men among those 65 and older. For Murray, a 64-year-old former preschool teacher, theyre all bread-and-butter family issues. And theyre sure to come into play in 2016, when the states senior senator runs for a fifth term. In the 2014 election cycle, Murray ranked 19th among sitting senators in receiving campaign donations from labor, according to the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington, D.C. which tracks political spending. She received $84,375 in the two-year cycle. While labor groups generally support her, many of them were angered by her vote in May to support Obamas plan for fast-track trade authority.]", "Date": "20150722", "Title": "[Sen.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  A new letter by intelligence investigators to the Justice Department says secret government information may have been compromised in Hillary Rodham Clintons private server, underscoring an inescapable reality for her presidential campaign: Email is forever. Clinton, the former secretary of state and now the leading Democratic presidential candidate, wants to focus on the economic issues she and her team believe will drive the next election. But they remain unable to fully escape the swirling questions surrounding her decision to run her State Department correspondence through an unsecured system set up at her New York home. The inspector general of the U.S. intelligence community recently alerted the Justice Department to the potential compromise of classified information arising from Clintons server. The IG also sent a memo to members of Congress that he had identified potentially hundreds of classified emails among the 30,000 that Clinton had provided to the State Department  a concern the office said it raised with FBI counterintelligence officials. Though the referral to the Justice Department does not seek a criminal probe and does not specifically target Clinton, the latest steps by government investigators will further fuel the partisan furor surrounding the 55,000 pages of emails already under review by the State Department. A statement from the intelligence inspector general, I. Charles McCullough, and his counterpart at the State Department, Steve Linick, said that McCulloughs office found four emails containing classified information in a limited sample of 40 emails. This classified information should have never been transmitted via an unclassified personal system, they said. For Clinton, the news amounted to a major distraction on a day when shed hoped to focus on unveiling a new set of economic policies. Instead, she opened her New York City speech by addressing the controversy, decrying some reports as inaccurate. Some media initially reported that Justice Department had been asked to consider a criminal investigation into whether she mishandled her emails. We are all accountable to the American people to get the facts right, and I will do my part but Im also going to stay focused on the issues, she said. It was not immediately clear whether the Justice Department would investigate the potential compromise highlighted by the intelligence inspector general. The office has not suggested any wrongdoing by Clinton, according to U.S. officials speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the referral publicly. But the inspector generals office said in its letter to Congressional oversight committees that it was concerned that these emails exist on at least one private server and thumb drive with classified information and those are not in the governments possession, said Andrea Williams, a spokeswoman for McCullough. None of the emails were marked as classified at the time they were sent or received, but some should have been handled as such and sent on a secure computer network, said the letter sent to congressional oversight committees. Clinton has maintained that she never sent classified information on her personal email account, which she said in March she used as a matter of convenience to limit her number of electronic devices. The State Department has made public some of the emails involving Clinton, and is under court order to make regular further releases of such correspondence. The aim is for the department to unveil all of 55,000 pages of the emails she turned over by Jan. 29, 2016. But a federal judge this month chastised the department for moving too slowly in providing The Associated Press with thousands of emails submitted through the Freedom of Information Act. Republicans are pushing Clinton to turn over her server to a third party for a forensic evaluation. Her poor judgment has undermined our national security, and it is time for her to finally do the right thing, said House Speaker John Boehner. Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said she had followed appropriate practices in dealing with classified materials. But theres little dispute among intelligence officials that Clinton should have been more careful with her information  though her behavior was likely not criminal. Current and former U.S. intelligence officials say they assume that all of the email that transited Clintons home server is in the possession of Russian or Chinese intelligence services, who would have easily bypassed whatever security measures she took. They, too, spoke on condition of anonymity because they werent authorized to discuss the Clinton email situation publicly. Whether a security violation or not, the risk for Democrats is that questions about her email harden into an early narrative about Clintons honesty and management skills. Already, Republicans have spent months depicting Clinton as a creature of Washington who flouts the rules for personal gain. Clintons people say questions about her correspondence wont sway voters, who they argue are more focused on economic and family issues. But, there are signs that the issue may have already affected views of their candidate. An Associated Press-GfK poll released last week found that voters view her as less decisive and inspiring than when she launched her presidential campaign just three months ago. Just 3 in 10 said the word honest describes her very or somewhat well.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  A partial agency shutdown looming, Senate Republicans offered Tuesday to permit a vote on Homeland Security funding legislation stripped of immigration provisions backed by conservatives but strongly opposed by President Barack Obama and fellow Democrats. We could have that vote very quickly, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. said as his party struggled to escape a political predicament of their own making involving an agency with major anti-terrorism responsibilities. McConnell said he did not know how the Republican-controlled House would respond if a stand-alone spending bill passed the Senate. Underscoring the realities of divided government, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada initially said he wouldnt agree to the proposal unless it had the backing of House Speaker John Boehner, in a sign it would be likely to clear the House. With House Republicans scheduled to meet privately Wednesday to discuss the issue, Boehners office issued a statement that neither accepted nor rejected the proposal McConnell outlined to end weeks of gridlock. The speaker has been clear: The House has acted, and now Senate Democrats need to stop hiding. Will they continue to block funding for the Department of Homeland Security or not? said Boehner spokesman Michael Steel. Some House conservatives criticized the proposal, but one lawmaker allied with the leadership predicted it might win approval. Noting that a federal judge in Texas has issued an order blocking implementation of Obamas plan to shield millions of immigrants from deportation, Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma said the court had effectively stopped the presidents executive action, at least for now. So I dont think wed run the risk of shutting down Homeland Security, he added. Even in the Senate, though, McConnells plan had its GOP critics. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a tea party favorite and potential 2016 presidential contender, called it a mistake. Congress is obliged to use every constitutional check and balance we have to rein in President Obamas lawlessness, he said in a statement. Senate Republican officials said McConnells offer of a vote on a stand-alone funding bill also envisions a vote on a separate measure to repeal a directive from Obama last fall that shields about 4 million immigrants from deportation even though they live in the United States illegally. That measure would almost certainly fail in the Senate at the hands of Democrats. At the same time, the proposal would eliminate an attempt by the House to repeal an earlier presidential order that allows tens of thousands of immigrants to remain in the country if they were brought here illegally as youngsters by their parents. Officials said Boehners office had been informed of McConnells plans before they were made public. The maneuvering occurred as the presidents party raised the specter of terrorism and the Republicans countered that it was the Democrats who were preventing an orderly renewal of funding for the Homeland Security Department. At a news conference a few hours before McConnell spoke, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. urged Republicans to fund our security and not to send a message to al-Shabab that were going to shut down Homeland Security. Klobuchars state is home to the Mall of America, an enormous facility that was singled out as a potential terror target in a video released by al-Shabab, an Islamic militant group linked to the al-Qaida terrorist network. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has urged anyone considering a trip to the shopping mall to be particularly careful. For their part, Republicans sought to pin the blame on Democrats, pointing out they blocked Senate action four times on the combined funding-immigration bill. They also accused Reid of shifting his demands after first seeking a vote on a stand-alone spending bill, then refraining from accepting McConnells offer. In response, Democrats seemed to backtrack, suggesting they may well sign on to McConnells offer whether or not Boehner does. But even Republicans said privately that they needed to put an end to a controversy that was likely to turn out badly for them. The current stand-off dates to last fall, when Boehner told fellow Republicans they should allow the funding of Homeland Security without conditions until after the elections. By then, he said, Republicans would have more leverage to force a rollback in the presidents immigration policy. Republicans won control of the Senate, but they lack the 60 votes needed to overcome Democratic blocking actions. As a result, they have been unable to force a vote on House-passed DHS funding legislation that includes the repeal of the immigration policies Obama put into effect in 2012 and last fall. Among some Republicans, there was recognition that McConnell was offering as graceful a way out as possible. I just dont know how we do it any other way, said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  After the Senates derailing of Republican legislation halting federal dollars for Planned Parenthood, one thing seems clear: Many on both sides think they can ring up gains from the battle. Abortion-rights groups are already releasing TV ads attacking GOP supporters of the measure for stomping on womens health care needs. Conservatives are accusing Democrats of voting to protect taxpayer funds for an organization whose campaign contributions tilt lopsidedly to Democratic candidates. And each party was bracing to revisit the fight next month, when Congress returns from its summer recess and considers legislation keeping government agencies open after their budgets expire Oct. 1. Conservatives see that as an opportunity to keep Planned Parenthood money out of those bills. GOP leaders, concerned that their party could be blamed, would prefer to avoid a government shutdown battle with President Barack Obama. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. repeated that sentiment Tuesday, telling reporters that while congressional investigations of Planned Parenthood were just beginning, No more government shutdowns. The Republican drive was prompted by graphic videos secretly recorded by anti-abortion activists that show Planned Parenthood officials coolly describing how they sometimes provide fetal tissue to medical researchers. Abortion opponents say the recordings caught Planned Parenthood illegally selling the organs for profit, while Planned Parenthood officials  while apologizing for their workers businesslike words  say theyve abided by laws that let them recoup the procedures costs. The anti-abortion group, the Center for Medical Progress, released its fifth video Tuesday in which people posing as purchasers of fetal tissue for researchers question a Planned Parenthood official. As in previous videos, the official describes how her clinic retrieves tissue and technicians pick through fetal organs  including what looks like a small arm  in lab dishes. Also Tuesday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said he had expanded his investigation into how Planned Parenthood obtains fetal tissue. He said he had now requested information from Planned Parenthood affiliates, private companies involved in the process and the Center for Medical Progress. Hed earlier sent questions to Planned Parenthood headquarters and asked the Justice Department about its enforcement of related laws. On Monday, the Senate voted 53-46 to advance a GOP bill terminating Planned Parenthoods federal funds. That was seven short of the 60 votes needed to keep the measure moving toward passage, effectively derailing it for now. Republicans expected to lose but envisioned political gain because the videos have fired up their core conservative, anti-abortion voters. Underscoring that, Tony Perkins, president of the anti-abortion Family Research Center, said Congress must take the next step and end Planned Parenthood funding when lawmakers return next month. The Republican measure calls for funneling Planned Parenthoods federal dollars to other providers of health care to women, including hospitals, state and local agencies and federally financed community health centers. Planned Parenthood and its allies say that would mean that many of its 2.7 million annual clients  many of whom are low-income women  would lose health care. National Right to Life President Carol Tobias said the movement against Planned Parenthood was gaining strength, calling it a long-term project and describing Planned Parenthood as a major backer of many Democratic senators. According to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, Planned Parenthoods campaign spending in the 2014 elections included $4.2 million in outside spending  which it used nearly exclusively to support Democrats or oppose GOP candidates. Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards said Mondays vote showed the bill was a political nonstarter. Acknowledging that Republicans may continue the battle, she said: This fight may not be over, but were ready for it. A Planned Parenthood ally, NARAL Pro-Choice America, said it would run TV ads this week attacking three GOP senators seeking re-election in 2016: Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Rob Portman of Ohio and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. Its clear Senator Ayotte should not be trusted with womens health, the New Hampshire ad says. The House is expected to vote on legislation ending Planned Parenthoods federal aid when Congress returns. Planned Parenthood says it gives fetal tissue to researchers only with a mothers advance consent and in fewer than five states. Planned Parenthood receives more than $500 million yearly in government funds  including state payments  more than one-third of its annual $1.3 billion in revenue. By law, federal funds cannot be used for abortions except for cases of incest, rape or when a womans life is in danger.]", "Date": "20150804", "Title": "[More fights ahead on Planned Parenthood after Senate vote]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation-politics/more-fights-ahead-on-planned-parenthood-after-senate-vote/", "Author": "[ALAN FRAM]"}
{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  An effort to draft Elizabeth Warren into the 2016 presidential race plans to close up shop next week, acknowledging that the Massachusetts senator will not  as she has repeatedly said  seek the Democratic nomination. MoveOn.org and Democracy for America said Tuesday they plan to suspend their Run Warren Run campaign on June 8. In their last act, theyll deliver a petition to Warren with more than 365,000 signatures urging her to run for president. The groups said they had already influenced the economic debate in 2016 and want to focus their efforts on working with Warren on issues such as trade, including defeating the effort to give President Obama so-called fast track authority to complete the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Even without her in the race, Elizabeth Warren and the Run Warren Run campaign she inspired have already transformed the 2016 presidential election by focusing every single Democratic candidate on combating our countrys income inequality crisis, said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy for America. Some of Warrens followers may back Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who is seeking the Democratic nomination and has offered an economic agenda in line with Warrens views. Sanders, who formally launched his campaign last week, has called for a political revolution to elevate issues like income inequality, overhauling the campaign finance system and addressing climate change. Ilya Sheyman, MoveOns executive director, said the campaign had helped elevate Warrens platform, an agenda that rejects the rigged status quo in Washington and puts working and middle-class Americans over corporate interests.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  Anyone in America can grow up to be president, as the saying goes  unless you happen to be a Muslim, a leading Republican presidential candidate believes. Its possibly one more self-inflicted dent in the partys professed commitment to broaden its appeal and promote tolerance. I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson said in an interview aired Sunday on NBCs Meet the Press. I absolutely would not agree with that. For GOP leaders, the 2016 campaign offered a chance at redemption and fresh pitch to minorities, gays, women and others beyond the traditional core supporters. After a blistering examination of the 2012 election, a report commissioned by Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus concluded that if our party is not welcoming and inclusive, young people and increasingly other voters will continue to tune us out. But it hasnt unfolded according to the hierarchys hoped-for script, with some high-profile candidates inviting lots of eyebrow-raising. Just in the past few days, their comments have underscored that the problems extend beyond the GOPs well-documented troubles appealing to Hispanics. To be sure, candidates Jeb Bush and others have disavowed some of that rhetoric or tried to stake out more moderate positions. It can be tough, though, to avoid getting drowned out by language sure to stir up people. Front-runner Donald Trump declined to correct a town hall participant who wrongly said President Barack Obama was a Muslim. Days later, Carson spoke about Muslims and the presidency  remarks described as un-American, by a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, Ibrahim Hooper. Hooper said the Constitution expressly bars religious tests for those seeking public office. To me this really means he is not qualified to be president of the United States, Hooper said. You cannot hold these kinds of views and at the same time say you will represent all Americans, of all faiths and backgrounds. Carson found no defender in rival John Kasich. The most important thing about being president is you have leadership skills, you know what youre doing, and you can help fix this country and raise this country. Those are the qualifications that matter to me, the Ohio governor told NBC. For Trump, the election of a Muslim president was something that could happen. Would I be comfortable? I dont know if we have to address it right now. 2016 hopeful Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, responded to Obamas nomination last week of an openly gay man to serve as Army secretary by saying the president is more interested in appeasing Americas homosexuals than honoring Americas heroes. Kasich told a story last week about a note left for him by a Latina hotel maid. A lot of them do jobs that theyre willing to do, and thats why in the hotel you leave a little tip, Kasich remarked. After Trumps town hall, Bush made clear he would not fuel the conspiracy theories about Obamas religion. He is an American, he is a Christian, the former Florida governor said Friday. And an exasperated Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. told ABCs This Week that these issues have been discussed ad nauseam over the last few years. Its a big waste of time. Barack Obama will not be president in a year and a half. Its time to start talking about the future of America. Kasich earned applause in the first Republican debate last month when he said that he opposes gay marriage but he accepted the Supreme Courts ruling making same-sex unions legal across the country. And guess what? I just went to a wedding of a friend of mine who happens to be gay, he added. Because somebody doesnt think the way I do doesnt mean that I cant care about them or I cant love them. Still, the rhetoric has provided an opening that Democrats are ready to try to exploit. Of course a Muslim, or any other American citizen, can run for president, end of story, said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who leads the Democratic National Committee. To think otherwise is not only harmful to our political process, but it elevates and validates discrimination in this country. Steve Schmidt, who served as Republican Sen. John McCains top strategist in the 2008 presidential election, said its problematic for the GOP to be seen as intolerant, particularly with moderate voters who help sway the general election. Of course its worrisome if you have a party thats perceived as anti-Latino, anti-Asian, anti-gay, intolerant of Muslims, Schmidt said. Asked specifically about Carsons comments, Schmidt said it exposed him as an amateur politician and underscored his total lack of understanding about the American political system. Kevin Madden, who worked for GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romneys 2012 campaign, said the GOP field is expanding the base, despite some of the high-profile missteps. There are over a dozen candidates running for president right now who are shaping the profile of the party and for everyone who promotes a view outside the mainstream, there are many more promoting views and policies focused on unifying the country and broadening the partys appeal, Madden said.]", "Date": "20150920", "Title": "[GOP wants to broaden appeal; will candidates get in the way?]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation-politics/fiorina-promises-a-fight-for-republican-nomination/", "Author": "[KEVIN FREKING, JULIE PACE]"}
{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon turned conservative star, has confirmed that he will seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. Carson, who has never run for public office, is expected to be the only high-profile African-American to enter the GOPs presidential primary as he tries to parlay his success as an author and speaker into a competitive campaign against established politicians. Im willing to be part of the equation and therefore, Im announcing my candidacy for president of the United States of America, he said in an interview aired Sunday night by Ohios WKRC television station. He is set to make a more formal announcement during a speech from his native Detroit on Monday. Carson earned national acclaim during 29 years leading the pediatric neurosurgery unit of Johns Hopkins Childrens Center in Baltimore, where he still lives. He directed the first surgery to separate twins connected at the back of the head. His career was notable enough to inspire the 2009 movie, Gifted Hands, with actor Cuba Gooding Jr. depicting Carson. I see myself as a member of we the people, he told the Associated Press in an interview earlier this year, arguing that his lack of experience is an asset. I see myself as a logical American who has common sense, he continued, and I think thats going to resonate with a lot of American, regardless of their political party. The 63-year-old Detroit native remains largely unknown outside of conservative activists who have embraced him since his address at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast, where he offered a withering critique of the modern welfare state and the nations overall direction. The speech restated themes from Carsons 2012 book America the Beautiful, but he excited conservatives by doing so with President Barack Obama sitting just feet away. Carson has since become a forceful critic of the nations first black president on everything from health care to foreign policy. Carson also offers himself as a counter to other notable African-American commentators with more liberal views. Most recently, Carson has spoken out on the unrest in the city where he lived for many years, where residents have protested and rioted in the wake of Freddie Gray dying while in custody of the Baltimore Police Department. In a Time op-ed, Carson decried the protests and related vandalism as gross misconduct. Carson moved to Palm Beach, Florida, after his retirement from Johns Hopkins, but he is announcing his campaign in his hometown of Detroit, where his mother raised him and his brother in poverty. He attributes his politics to his upbringing, often describing his neighborhood culture as one where residents celebrating any new announcement of government support. Still, he acknowledges that his mother received welfare aid, and he insists that he supports a safety net for the people who need a safety net. Carson is a staunch social conservative, opposing abortion rights and same-sex marriage, views he attributes to his personal faith as a practicing Christian. He has more complex views on health care and foreign policy, including statements that could put him at odds with the most conservative branches of his party. He has compared the Affordable Care Act, Obamas signature legislative achievement, to slavery. Yet Carson also has blasted for-profit insurance companies; called for stricter regulations  including of prices  of health care services; and said government should offer a nationalized insurance program for catastrophic care. Carson pitches himself as a staunch supporter of Israel in its disputes with other Middle Eastern nations, and he has hammered Obama on his dealings in the region. But in his earlier writings, Carson criticized the U.S. for historically being too eager to wage war.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  Democratic Arizona Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick said Tuesday she will challenge Republican John McCain for his Senate seat next year, launching an uphill bid to unseat the five-term senator in the GOP-leaning state. Kirkpatrick, 65, is serving her third House term in a district she has won narrowly. She was already being targeted by Republicans for what was expected to be her House re-election bid in 2016. Kirkpatricks decision to try to unseat McCain is seen by Republicans as an acknowledgment that her district is soon likely to be redrawn to make it more GOP friendly. The U.S. Supreme Court is considering a challenge to the constitutionality of Arizonas independent redistricting commission, a voter-enacted panel that took the redrawing of lines away from the Republican-controlled Legislature. Former Arizona House Speaker Andy Tobin, who has championed the lawsuit the high court is now considering, lost to Kirkpatrick by 5 percentage points in Novembers election. He said Tuesday that it is too early to say if hell try again to win the 1st District seat, especially since the Legislature is expected to radically redraw the states nine districts to create more GOP-controlled seats this summer if the Supreme Court strikes down the redistricting law. Its a hard call, but I dont think that I should be jumping the gun and throwing in my hat when the Legislature may have work to do  its premature, Tobin said. Tobin said he believes Kirkpatrick is motivated by the looming Supreme Court decision. Justices in early March heard the case brought by the GOP-controlled Arizona Legislature and seemed likely to overturn the states redistricting scheme. I think she sees the writing on the wall, Tobin said. Republicans running the state Legislature filed the lawsuit after complaining that the commission helped Democrats by packing large numbers of GOP voters into just a few districts. The states U.S. House delegation now has five Republicans and four Democrats, and GOP leaders say they expect at least a 7-2 split if the Legislature redraws the lines. McCain was his partys unsuccessful 2008 presidential candidate, losing to Barack Obama. A Navy flier who was held prisoner during the Vietnam War, McCain, 78, has long been one of his partys most influential voices on military and foreign policy issues and is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. McCain announced his intention to seek re-election in April at a meeting of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry. With a full heart, I ask Arizonans again for their support as I seek re-election to the United States Senate, McCain told the supportive crowd. Im as determined as ever to deserve your trust and grateful as ever for the privilege. McCain, who was first elected to the Senate in 1986 and will be 80 when he seeks re-election next year, expects at least one GOP challenger. The state Republican Partys leaders, dominated by conservatives, censured McCain last year for not being sufficiently conservative, but hes brushed off the criticism. The most prominent Republican to hint of challenging McCain is state Sen. Kelli Ward, a conservative member of the Arizona Legislature. McCain will be a formidable opponent for any challenger. He already has more than $3.5 million in cash on hand and the ability to raise much more. Kirkpatrick has a tenth that amount in the bank. I respect John McCains service to our nation, Kirkpatrick said in a video her campaign released. I just believe our states changing. The former prosecutors video also emphasized her roots in the state, including pictures of boots she says she purchased with tips from waitressing. Im not naive, she says. I know that Washington insiders are already trying to dig up dirt. But having grown up here, a little mud on my boots is part of life. Andrea Bozek, spokeswoman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate GOPs political arm, criticized Kirkpatrick for backing Obamas health care and other programs. Ann Kirkpatrick has been part of the problem in Washington and Arizonans are paying the price, Bozek said.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  Democrats closed ranks around Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday after her public explanation of her email practices  yet party officials in important election states appeared resigned to the prospect that her all-but-certain presidential campaign will be saddled with drama and controversy. The mood among Democrats around the country suggested Clinton has work to do to bolster party enthusiasm as she nears the launch of her 2016 campaign, though theres still no sign shell face a robust primary challenge. Brady Quirk-Garvan, the Democratic Party chairman in Charleston, South Carolina, said the intense focus on Clintons use of her private email account as secretary of state leaves him concerned that side issues could overshadow the partys message. Every time we talk about emails, we arent talking about how to grow the economy and the fact that President Obama has created jobs for the last 60 months straight, Quirk-Garvan said. In Iowa, Cerro Gordo County Democratic chairman John Stone said he expected the email issue to burn out. But he also raised the possibility that there will be more things to come. Clintons closest advisers have been quietly reaching out to Democratic leaders and other lawmakers on Capitol Hill, as well as influential progressive groups, in an effort to allay concerns. In conference calls over the past week, supporters in turn pressed Clinton to break her silence on the email disclosures, which she eventually did Tuesday in a 20-minute news at the United Nations. Those of us who strongly support her, we certainly have been given information, said Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich. Im satisfied with what Ive received. Much of the outreach has been led by longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin and press secretary Nick Merrill. Clinton herself does not appear to have spoken directly to top Democratic lawmakers or surrogates since her use of personal email and a private server as secretary of state was reported last week. Two Democratic leadership aides and others familiar with the Clinton teams outreach described the efforts, insisting on anonymity to describe the private communications. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said he wasnt aware of any conversations between President Barack Obama and Clinton about the former secretary of states email use. Even as Clintons advisers do status checks with wary Democrats, her team has been moving forward with plans to formally announce her candidacy next month, perhaps in a swing state or on a college campus. Newly hired staff members are moving to New York, where the campaign will be headquartered. The skeleton team that has been traveling with Clinton for the past year has also been expanding, with Kristina Schake, a former communications director for first lady Michelle Obama, seen accompanying Clinton to an event in Washington last week. Still, the email issue has essentially served as the Clinton campaigns opening act, thrusting her squarely onto the political playing field she has been trying to avoid. Its also provided fresh fodder for congressional Republicans who want to keep their investigations into the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, alive through the presidential campaign. Rep. Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina Republican who chairs a House committee investigating the attacks, said Wednesday that he wants an independent review of Clintons email server. The House Oversight Committee also said it will seek access to the electronic versions of Clintons emails, not just printed copies, and was prepared to issue a subpoena if necessary. However, in a sign that the matter isnt shaking up the Democratic primary field, Clinton has faced no public criticism from any of the candidates who seem most likely to challenge her. Former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley again passed up an opportunity to weigh in Wednesday. In fact, the party has spent little time cultivating other potential candidates should her bid for the White House implode. Still, Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of swing state New Hampshire was restrained in her defense of Clinton Wednesday, saying it remains to be seen how the email matter will affect her state. Clinton described her exclusive use of personal email as secretary of state as a matter of convenience and a way to avoid using two devices. She insists she did not violate federal rules requiring government officials to preserve written communications involving official business and says she turned over more than 30,000 work-related emails to the State Department last year, at the agencys request. That email trove represents half of the communications housed on a personal server, Clinton said. She said that because the rest of the emails were personal in nature, she got rid of them during the process of compiling files for the State Department. The agencys internal watchdog released a report Wednesday showing many department employees have not been preserving emails for the public record. The inspector generals office said that in 2011, when Clinton was secretary of state, department employees wrote more than 1 billion emails but marked only 61,156 for the public record. Also Wednesday, The Associated Press filed a lawsuit against the State Department in an effort to force the release of email correspondence and government documents from her tenure as secretary of state. The lawsuit follows Freedom of Information Act requests that went unfulfilled.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  Former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley plans to announce his decision on a presidential campaign May 30 in Baltimore, preparing for what would be a longshot bid for the Democratic nomination. OMalley would enter the 2016 race as a relatively unknown figure nationally and face a steep test against front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton. The ex-Baltimore mayor, who has visited early-voting states, has tried to present himself as a champion of progressive causes and a fresh face for liberals hesitant to support Clinton. OMalley held multiple conference calls Thursday night with top supporters, former aides and friends to discuss plans for the May 30 announcement. OMalley did not explicitly say he would run for president but said he was inclined to do so and encouraged participants to tap into their network of contacts to support his campaign if he runs, according to three participants who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private calls. During the calls, OMalley spoke about the economic challenges facing the nation and how he would bring new leadership, progressive values and a record of getting things done, the participants said. Bill Hyers, a senior adviser to OMalleys political action committee, OPAC, and a potential campaign manager, said they were planning to hire staff in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. The call reinforced what OMalley has been saying for months  that he would make a final decision by the end of spring. My timeline for a while has been by the end of May and that remains my timeline. So stay tuned, OMalley told reporters Wednesday in New Hampshire, home of the nations first presidential primary. OMalleys announcement date was first reported by The Washington Post. His PAC blasted out an email to supporters on Thursday urging them to sign up on his website to be the first to know about his decision. Holding the announcement in Baltimore could carry risk. OMalleys record as city leader a decade ago has faced scrutiny since rioting broke out following the death of Freddie Gray in police custody. OMalley, mayor from 1999 until he was elected governor in 2006, has defended his work to curb violent crime in Baltimore and signaled it would play a leading role in a presidential campaign. He frequently talks about his record in Maryland: supporting gay marriage and gun control, ending the death penalty, providing in-state college tuition for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. He has outlined a potential 2016 that would focus on economic inequality, immigration, campaign finance reform and national security. Already in the race is Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who has courted liberal voters in the party. Former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb also might run. Each of the Democrats looking to challenge Clinton is hoping to become a viable alternative for Democrats who want a competitive primary. Rather than directly criticize Clinton, the 52-year-old OMalley has tried to portray himself as a fresh face representing a new generation of leadership. During an event in Durham, home of the University of New Hampshire, OMalley was asked what his presidency might offer to the aspirations of women. OMalley noted that Democrats helped make history by electing the nations first black president, Barack Obama, and he cited his policies in Maryland that he said have been a benefit to women. While some voters may want to elect the first female president, OMalley said there is also a yearning of the next generation of Americans who want a new perspective and  to solve those problems with new leadership and new perspective.

But when asked how she feels about encouraging large contributions to a group supporting her candidacy, she replied: Do I wish that we didnt have to be doing this? Yeah, I do. Clintons paradox when it comes to fundraising explain why, six months into the 2016 race for president, Democrats are barely in the conversation when it comes to the groups known as super PACs. The groups, which unlike formal campaigns can accept contributions of any size, will formally report their fundraising totals Friday to federal regulators. But most of those aligned with specific presidential candidates have already said how much they raised between January and the end of June. So far, they account for roughly $2 of every $3 given in the 2016 presidential race, with the vast majority of those donations aimed at helping Republicans win back the White House. Less than 9 percent of the money given to candidate-specific super PACs so far will benefit Clinton and her rivals for the Democratic nomination, according to an Associated Press analysis. The AP compared money raised by formal presidential campaigns with what the super PACs say they plan to report having raised on Friday. The main pro-Clinton group, Priorities USA Action, raised $15.6 million in the first half of this year. That puts it behind super PACs pledged to support five contenders for the Republican nomination, including one whose polling numbers are so weak that he may not even qualify to take part in next weeks GOP debate. We all have to get real about the clown car of Republican candidates that could very well be the limousine the next president is riding around in, said Damian ODoherty, who heads up the super PAC helping Democratic candidate Martin OMalley. Clinton would appear to be a candidate readily able to land million-dollar donors to a super PAC backing her candidacy. She has more than two-dozen years in the presidential spotlight, dating to her husbands first run for the White House, and strong ties to big-money power bases on Wall Street, in Hollywood and among organized labor. And some of the top donors in Democratic politics have given massive checks to Priorities, including entertainment executive Haim Saban, whose $2 million gift makes him the largest donor to the super PAC so far, and hedge fund billionaire George Soros at $1 million. But while Priorities collected from about 30 donors in the first six months of the year, the super PAC helping Republican candidate Jeb Bush persuaded 9,900 contributors to give a record haul of $103 million. Bushs super PAC also has more than a dozen contributors who have given at least $1 million, with the top donor, Miami health care investor Miguel Mike Fernandez, giving $3 million. The bottom lines for super PACs backing four other GOP contenders: $38 million for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, $26 million for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, $16 million for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and $16.8 million for former Texas Gov. Rick Perry  who may not have the poll numbers needed to make the top 10 cutoff for the first GOP debate. Priorities, at least, can measure its donations in the millions. Generation Forward, the super PAC organized to help OMalley, raised just $289,000 since the former Maryland governor announced his candidacy at the end of May. The three other contenders dont appear to have any outside help, while Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has bluntly said, I will not have a super PAC. The difference is driven in part by that attitude. Democrats have largely condemned the 2010 decision of the Supreme Court in the case known as Citizens United that, along with subsequent court and regulatory actions, created the super PAC and the era of unlimited donations. Clinton, for example, said at the outset of her campaign that opposition to the Supreme Court ruling would be a litmus test for her nominees to the high court. As Mitt Romney and other Republicans began raising hundreds of millions of dollars through super PACs in 2012, President Barack Obama reluctantly blessed Priorities, which some of his former aides created. Yet he appeared as a featured speaker at only one of its donor gatherings. The Obama campaign treated Priorities like an unwanted stepchild, said Steven Law, president of American Crossroads, one of the best-funded super PACs dedicated to helping Republicans. That on-again, off-again relationship affects donor behavior. But ODoherty, the head of the pro-OMalley super PAC, predicted that as the stakes become clear, Democratic donors will begin opening their wallets to super PACs, even if theyre still a little bit contemptuous of these organizations. Clintons allies have set lofty goals for fundraising: Priorities hopes to at least triple the $80 million it raised for Obama. The group, which began a fundraising push when the former secretary of states aides came aboard in May, secured $14.5 million in new commitments in July, said a person familiar with the groups fundraising, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss details that wont be made public for another six months. Bill Burton, one of the former Obama aides who started Priorities and isnt involved with the group this time, said would-be Democratic super PAC donors are probably waiting to feel like their money could make a difference. Priorities biggest fundraising boon came the day after the first 2012 general election debate, Burton said, when Obamas performance was widely panned. Nothing inspires donors like sheer panic, he said. __, Associated Press writer Lisa Lerer contributed to this report.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  Hillary Rodham Clinton jumped back into presidential politics on Sunday, making a much-awaited announcement she will again seek the White House with a promise to serve as the champion of everyday Americans. Clinton opened her bid for the 2016 Democratic nomination by positioning herself as the heir to the diverse coalition of voters who elected her immediate predecessor and former campaign rival, President Barack Obama, as well as an appeal to those in her party still leery of her commitment to fighting income inequality. And unlike eight years ago, when she ran as a candidate with a deep resume in Washington, Clinton and her personal history werent the focus of the first message of her campaign. In the online video that kicked off her campaign, she made no mention of her time in the Senate and four years as secretary of state, or the prospect she could make history as the nations first female president. Instead, the video is collection of voters talking about their lives, their plans and aspirations for the future. Clinton doesnt appear until the very end. Im getting ready to do something, too. Im running for president, Clinton said. Americans have fought their way back from tough economic times, but the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top. Every day Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion, so you can do more than just get by. You can get ahead and stay ahead. Its a message that also made an immediate play to win over the support of liberals in her party for whom economic inequality has become a defining issue. They remain skeptical of Clintons close ties to Wall Street and the centrist economic policies of the administration of her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Many had hoped Clinton would face a challenge from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has said she will not run. It would do her well electorally to be firmly on the side of average working people who are working harder than ever and still not getting ahead, said economist Robert Reich, a former labor secretary during the Clinton administration who has known Hillary Clinton for nearly five decades. Unlike some of the Republicans who have entered the race, Clinton was scant on policy specifics on her first day as a candidate. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, for example, kicked off his campaign with a website and online videos that described his positions on an array of domestic and foreign policy issues. Clinton also began her campaign for president in 2007 with a video, followed by a splashy rally in Des Moines where she said, Im running for president, and Im in it to win it. This time around, Clinton will instead head this week to the first-to-vote Iowa, looking to connect with voters directly at a community college and small business roundtable in two small towns. When families are strong, America is strong. So Im hitting the road to earn your vote. Because its your time. And I hope youll join me on this journey, she said in the video. This voter-centric approach was picked with a purpose, her advisers said, to show that Clinton is not taking the nomination for granted. Her campaign said Sunday she would spend the next six to eight weeks in a ramp-up period, and she would not hold her first rally and deliver a campaign kickoff speech until May. Clinton is the first high-profile Democrat to get into the race, and she quickly won the endorsement of several leading members of her party, including her home state governor, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. Still, there are some lesser-known Democrats who are considering challenging her, including former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley and Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders. During this campaign, it is imperative that Secretary Clinton, like every other candidate, address the great challenges of our time: the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality that is crushing our middle class, Sanders said. The GOP did not wait for her announcement to begin their campaign against her. The partys chairman, Reince Priebus, has outlined plans for a broad effort to try to undermine her record as secretary of state while arguing that her election would be like giving Obama a third term. Republicans have also jumped on Clintons use of a personal email account and server while she was secretary of state, as well as her handling of the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, in his own online video, said Sunday: We must do better than the Obama-Clinton foreign policy that has damaged relationships with our allies and emboldened our enemies. Should she win the Democratic nomination, Clinton will need to overcome history to win the White House. In the last half-century, the same party has held the White House for three consecutive terms only once, during the administrations of Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. As part of her launch, Clinton also will leave the board of her familys foundation. The 2016 campaign is likely to be the most expensive in history, with total spending on both sides expected to well exceed the more than $1 billion spent by each of the two nominees campaigns four years ago. This weekend, Clinton campaign fundraisers escalated their outreach to Democratic donors, who largely back her bid, with a flurry of phone calls urging them to donate as soon as possible. Her team on Sunday encouraged donors to become Hillstarters by raising $27,000 for the campaign in the next 30 days.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  Hillary Rodham Clinton plans to more fully address questions about her use of a private email server as secretary of state starting this month, part of an acknowledgment by her campaign that her presidential bid has been hurt by the heavy focus on the controversy over the summer. Weve had some headwinds particularly around the email question, said Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Theres been a lot of noise thats made it more difficult to break through. On Friday, Clinton will sit down for an interview with MSNBC  the third national television interview of her four-month presidential campaign. The appearance will be the first in a series of media appearances that campaign staff say Clinton will participate in this fall, before her Oct. 22 public testimony to a congressional committee investigating the deadly 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya. This week, members of the House panel are questioning Cheryl Mills, Clintons former chief of staff, and Jake Sullivan, another former top aide who now works on Clintons presidential campaign, behind closed doors. Clinton aides see the hearing as an opportunity to address questions about her email set-up, arguing that it gives the former New York senator a congressional platform to shame her Republican critics for what they view as a little more than a political witch-hunt. Clinton, the Democratic front-runner for the 2016 nomination, has struggled to explain her use of a private email server for government business during her tenure as secretary of state. We know that we have good answers on these questions that people have, and were going to make sure people hear from her, said Clinton campaign communications director Jen Palmieri. Still, aides say, Clinton remains the strongest candidate in the presidential contest, arguing the race is fundamentally unchanged from earlier this summer. We feel confident that were on a path to victory in both the primary and the general election, Podesta said. Clintons fall agenda also includes a heavier focus on foreign policy starting on Wednesday, when shes scheduled to deliver an address about the nuclear deal with Iran. Her campaign said on Thursday that theyve opened 27 offices, signed up 23,000 volunteers and contacted 1.35 million households in the four early primary states.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  Hillary Rodham Clinton spent nearly two years tiptoeing around a decision to run for president that much of the political world assumed was a done deal. Clinton didnt make a final call until the holidays. She spent her annual Christmas vacation last year in the Dominican Republic wading through 500 pages of memos and polling analysis, and discussing the material with her husband, former two-term President Bill Clinton. When Clinton returned to New York in the new year, there was no meeting with staff or email to friends to announce her candidacy. The former senator and secretary of state simply started telling advisers to move forward with hiring and find a campaign headquarters. Clinton formally launched her campaign Sunday in an online video. The announcement cements her status as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, back within sight of an elusive ambition and a history-making turn as the nations first female commander in chief. Already one of the worlds most analyzed figures, the 67-year-old will be subjected to months more scrutiny of her wealth, her appearance and health, and her personal relationships. To Clintons critics, her campaign is the calculated next act in a master plan shes crafted with her husband. Clinton friends bristle at that depiction. Interviews with nearly 20 people who have spent significant time with Clinton in recent years reveal a decision-making process that was slow, almost painstakingly deliberate, a reflection of Clintons methodical and cautious nature. Some of those interviewed requested anonymity in order to speak candidly about their private conversations with Clinton. Clinton didnt shut down talk of another White House run after she left the State Department in early 2013, but she wasnt ready to jump back into presidential politics either. After returning to private life for the first time in more than two decades, Clinton told people that her main goals were to walk, sleep and eat. Last summer, Democratic officials told Clinton that if she was even considering running for president, she needed to hit the campaign trail for her party during the midterm elections. President Barack Obama was considered politically toxic, but candidates were clamoring to appear alongside the woman they hoped would be their partys next leader. Clinton would headline 45 events for 26 candidates. More than half lost. The Democratic defeats proved clarifying for Clinton. She concluded that the party had run scared, done little to defend its accomplishments on the economy and health care, and failed to articulate what it wanted to do in the future. Clinton plunged into discussions about her own potential campaign and sought to answer the questions she felt Democrats had ignored during the midterms. She convened long economic discussions that centered on income inequality and the widening achievement gap. Foreign policy experts gave her their diagnosis of pressing problems in the Middle East and with Russia. Clinton took hand-written notes and stockpiled multi-page memos. She wanted to be satisfied that she had a set of policies and ideas that could really make a difference for people and she had a theory of change to get them done, said John Podesta, her new campaigns chairman. She went pretty deep. The political data Clinton consumed underscored the demographic advantages the Democratic Party has built up among Hispanics, African-Americans and women. Clinton seeks to pick off one or two percent more of the white vote and women than Obama. What resonated with Clinton more than the policy papers and the polling were appeals to her sense of duty, a hallmark of her Methodist upbringing in the Midwest. She was by far the most qualified Democrat to run, supporters argued. If she didnt run, what other Democrat could win?, If a young Bill Clinton was out there today and she saw that and believed in that persons ideas, character and competence, I am absolutely convinced she would not run, said Lynn Forester de Rothschild, a longtime friend and Clinton financial backer. There was plenty that gave Clinton pause. She grimaced at the thought of giving up her privacy again. She worried about putting Chelsea, husband Marc and their baby in the spotlight. She felt bad that her candidacy would crowd out Vice President Joe Biden, a longtime friend who was also toying with a White House run. Clinton was also mindful of chatter that she could be challenged from her partys liberal left flank. She set up a meeting with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose anti-Wall Street positions were galvanizing progressives and stoking talk that she could launch her own 2016 campaign. The meeting was as much an opportunity for Clinton to gauge the mood of progressives as it was a chance to size up the seriousness of Warrens repeated denials of a White House run. By December, most of Clintons anxieties had been resolved. Her private deliberations over the holidays would put to rest her internal debate. _, Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC]", "Date": "20150413", "Title": "[Hillary Clintons long road back into presidential politics]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/hillary-clintons-long-road-back-into-presidential-politics/", "Author": "[JULIE PACE]"}
{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  Hispanic leaders are bristling at the largely tepid response by Republican presidential candidates to Donald Trumps characterization of Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug dealers. Several 2016 contenders have brushed off Trumps comments while others have ignored them. Marco Rubio, a Florida senator who is Hispanic, denounced them as not just offensive and inaccurate, but also divisive, after declining for two weeks to address the matter directly. Another Hispanic in the race, Ted Cruz, said Trump is terrific, brash and speaks the truth. Its an uncomfortable moment for Republicans, who want more votes from the surging Latino population. And it could be a costly moment if more candidates dont go beyond their Donald-will-be-Donald response and condemn him directly, said Alfonso Aguilar, a Republican who leads the American Principles Projects Latino Partnership. The time has come for the candidates to distance themselves from Trump and call his comments what they are: ludicrous, baseless and insulting, Aguilar said. Sadly, it hurts the party with Hispanic voters. Its a level of idiocy I havent seen in a long time. So far, Trump has paid less of a political price than a commercial one. The leading Hispanic television network, Univision, has backed out of televising the Miss USA pageant, a joint venture between Trump and NBC, which also cut ties with Trump. On Wednesday, the Macys department store chain, which carried a Donald Trump menswear line, said it was ending its relationship with him. Other retailers are facing pressure to follow suit. On Friday, the NASCAR motorsports series said it will not hold its season-ending awards ceremony at the Trump National Doral Miami. The CEO of a top NASCAR sponsor, Camping Worlds Marcus Lemonis, had said he would not participate in the awards ceremony if it were held at a property owned by Trump, whom he criticized for recent and ongoing blatantly bigoted and racist comments  in regards to immigrants. In his speech last month marking his entry into the Republican race, Trump said Mexican immigrants are bringing drugs. Theyre bringing crime. Theyre rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. The businessman has refused to back down, although he insists his remarks were misconstrued. My statements have been contorted to seem racist and discriminatory, he wrote in a message to supporters on Thursday. What I want is for legal immigrants to not be unfairly punished because others are coming into America illegally, flooding the labor market and not paying taxes. His original comments, though, did not make a distinction between Mexicans who came to U.S. legally and those here illegally. His rhetoric may resonate with some of the Republican Partys most passionate voters, who have long viewed illegal immigration as one of the nations most pressing problems. But the 2016 contest brings opportunity for the party to make inroads with Hispanics, with several Latino candidates and a former Florida governor, Jeb Bush, who has deep Latino ties and speaks Spanish and hasnt been shy about using it in the campaign. Even so, Bush has said little more about Trumps comments than that they were wrong. Maybe well have a chance to have an honest discussion about it onstage, Bush said last weekend while campaigning in Nevada, referring to Republican presidential debates. Rev. Gabriel Salguero, president of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition, is paying keen attention to how the candidates respond to Trumps xenophobic rhetoric. Were listening very, very closely, not just what candidates say but what they dont say  the sins of commission and the sins of omission, he said. Among 2016 contenders:, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called Trumps comments wholly inappropriate. But in a subsequent radio interview, he said Trump is a really wonderful guy (whos) always been a good friend. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry said: I dont think Donald Trumps remarks reflect the Republican Party. Cruz said he likes Trump and thinks NBC is engaging in political correctness in breaking ties with him. Rubio said the next president needs to be someone who brings Americans together  not someone who continues to divide. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former technology executive Carly Fiorina and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson have been silent. Not since the 2004 re-election campaign of President George W. Bush has a Republican presidential candidate earned as much as 40 percent of the Hispanic vote. Mitt Romney got a dismal 27 percent in the 2012 contest against President Barack Obama.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  If he runs for president as expected, Sen. Marco Rubio will have a political committee ready to raise and spend unlimited cash on his behalf. Rubio is set to announce his 2016 campaign plans in a speech Monday in Miami and would become the third major candidate to declare his White House ambitions. A first-term senator representing Florida, the Cuban-American Rubio is expected to bypass a second term in favor of pursuing the presidency and becoming the first Hispanic president. But from even his most enthusiastic supporters, Rubio can only accept $2,700 to help him win the nomination. The pro-Rubio, independent Conservative Solutions PAC will face no such limits. Conservative Solutions is set to collect checks from deep-pocketed donors to pay for as many television, digital and radio ads as it can afford to boost Rubios chances. This race will be won by the candidate with the best vision for where to take this nation and the resources to ensure that message is heard, veteran strategist Warren Tompkins said in a statement released to The Associated Press early Thursday morning. Marco has the vision  few have laid out in as much detail where theyd like to lead this country  and were going to spend the next two years ensuring that the resources are there and used to effectively share that vision with voters. Super PACs are political committees that operate independently of the candidates and cannot coordinate strategy with the campaigns of those seeking office. But they often can play an outsized role in shaping how voters view the candidates because they can buy so much more advertising than the campaigns can afford. For instance, Priorities USA spent $65 million to boost President Barack Obamas re-election bid in 2012. The Restore Our Future super PAC spent $142 million to help Mitt Romney win the Republican nomination and then face Obama in the general election. Heading into 2016, Priorities USA is repositioning itself as the de facto super PAC for presumed Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton. And most of her Republican rivals have outside admirers in the process of assembling their own bottomless political ATM machines. Rubio is no different now. Led by veteran Republican consultant Warren Tompkins, Conservative Solutions PAC is set to be Rubios primary advertising partner, allowing the official campaign to focus on other nuts-and-bolts functions of running a race, such as building databases, knocking on doors and staging public events. Conservative Solutions officials declined to provide a budget, but Newt Gingrichs failed presidential bid in 2012 proved a super PAC only needs a single patron to be effective. The pro-Gingrich super PAC Winning the Future collected $20 million from casino billionaires Sheldon and Miriam Adelson to keep it afloat after a string of primary losses. (The Adelsons then gave Romneys super PAC $30 million when he became the nominee.), Rubio has met with the Adelsons multiple times since January although they remain uncommitted in the presidential campaign and are considering a lesser role in 2016. Tompkins is a major get for Rubios allies, and not just because he has seven presidential primaries on his resume. He was Ronald Reagans political director during the South Carolina primary, then went on to work for the campaigns of George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush and Romney. Bypassing the likely candidacy of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, the son of George H.W. Bush and brother of George W. Bush, will probably be seen as a slight from a party elder who has worked with the Bush clan since 1980. Making what is expected to be a raft of ads will be Jon Lerner, who has more than two-dozen winning House, Senate and gubernatorial campaigns to his credit. Most recently, he has been the advertising adviser for the last four successful gubernatorial campaigns in South Carolina. Jon Graham will head up fundraising for the group, which can take unlimited cash from donors but must disclose its fundraising and spending on a regular basis. His firm, Gula Graham, has raised more than $100 million since it was formed in 2009. And Jeff Sadosky, a veteran of George W. Bushs re-election bid and John McCains presidential campaign, will manage the communications for the super PAC. Sadoskys most recent campaign was Rob Portmans successful bid for Senate in Ohio in 2010. He served as a senior aide in Portmans Senate office before going to work in the private sector.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  If Marco Rubio launches his presidential campaign as expected Monday, the first-term Republican senator from Florida may have to answer this simple question. Why now?, The 43-year-old Rubio, a rising star on Capitol Hill, could wait four more years, even eight, and still be a relatively young candidate. Some party officials want him run for governor or try to hold his Senate seat, which could be crucial to continued GOP control of the chamber. By training his sights on the White House, Rubio also sets up a head-to-head competition with Jeb Bush, a mentor with whom he has many overlapping supporters. But the window to run for president can close as quickly as it opens. Then-Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois seized an opportunity in 2008 and won. Donors clamored for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to run in 2012, but he declined and now heads into the 2016 campaign in a decidedly weaker position. Theres no telling that (Rubios) opportunity will be better four or eight years from now, said Fergus Cullen, the former New Hampshire Republican chairman who is yet to throw his support behind a candidate. Rubios advisers know all about the fickle preferences of the electorate. Rubio was a beneficiary of the 2010 tea party wave that swept dozens of conservative lawmakers into Congress just two years after Obama and Democrats won big. Rubio was expected to announce his candidacy Monday in his hometown of Miami, which would put him in the shadow of Democrat Hillary Rodham Clintons highly anticipated announcement Sunday of a second White House run. But Rubios team sees an opportunity to answer the why now question and argue the countrys pressing problems require a new generation of leaders, not a return to the 1990s. Rubio is about to step into a field that is shaping up to be crowded and competitive. He wont be the only senator in the race. He wont be the only tea party-aligned candidate. He wont even be the only Floridian, the only Cuban-American or the only candidate claiming foreign policy expertise. Some are better known  Bush, for one. But it is early, and Rubios advisers say they are playing a long game. Campaigns are won at the end, not at the beginning, said Alex Conant, Rubios spokesman. Miamis Freedom Tower was picked as the expected backdrop for Rubios campaign announcement. The landmark was once the federal processing center for tens of thousands of Cuban exiles arriving in the U.S. in the 1960s and 1970s. Rubios parents left Cuba in 1956, shortly before Fidel Castro took power. The senator plans to make his familys immigrant past and his own success story a central part of his campaign. He also intends to play up his hawkish foreign policy views and experience on two powerful national security-focused Senate committees as he tries to sell his qualifications to be commander in chief. Rubio was expected to return to Washington in time for a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing Tuesday on Iran. Like his Republican presidential rivals, Rubio has been sharply critical of Obamas deal-making with Iran over its disputed nuclear program. Rubio will headline fundraisers in New York and Boston later in the coming week. He was a strong fundraiser for Republicans in the 2014 elections and a popular draw in their campaigns, though he will be competing with Bush for some high-dollar Florida donors. Rubio supporters recently announced the formation of a super PAC to bolster his candidacy. Rubio is set to make his first campaign stop as a presidential candidate Friday in New Hampshire. Hes also expected to visit Iowa, South Carolina and possibly Nevada by the end of the month, aides said. When Rubios campaign set Monday at its launch date, aides knew Clinton could be looking at the same window. The team weighed the risks of Clintons announcement upstaging Rubios event, but decided to move forward. Lin Bennett, the first vice chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party, said Rubio could set himself apart in the Republican field by getting the first shot at rebutting Clintons candidacy. It would be a plus for him that I hope hell take advantage of, said Bennett, who is unaffiliated in the Republican primary.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  In a presidential campaign, you only get one Opening Day. For Ted Cruz, it was a simple speech on a college campus: no notes, no teleprompter  and no choice for the students required to be there. Rand Paul packed a hotel ballroom with loyalists and dazzled them with videos and goofy campaign swag. Up next is Marco Rubio, who appears ready to enter the race Monday and will surely spend the weekend wondering if Hillary Rodham Clinton will ruin his moment with a Sunday night message that shes getting in, too. No matter when you do it, you have the problem of butting against somebody else, and if that somebody else is Hillary Clinton, its going to take a lot of the air out of the room, said John Brabender, an adviser to expected GOP candidate Rick Santorum. For whats expected to be a field of as many as two dozen candidates, the formal announcement sets the stage for what they hope will be a triumphant march to the White House. Most are carefully choreographed, some struggle to draw attention, and each sends a signal to voters about whether theyre watching a contender or just another soon-to-be has-been. Its the one part of the campaign, besides picking a vice president, that the candidate can totally control, said Scott Reed, a Republican strategist who served as Bob Doles 1996 campaign manager. They set the tone. For Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, that meant weeks of planning for a launch expected to include Jumbotrons and a diverse audience of supporters at downtown Miamis iconic Freedom Tower, the first stop for tens of thousands of fleeing Cuban exiles during the 1960s and 1970s. The event is officially billed as a big announcement to stoke anticipation about Rubios decision on whether to run for president or seek re-election to the Senate. For the past week, Rubio has teased supporters on social media, including running a contest to win a trip to the event. Hes also asking them to sign up for an email to get first word of his announcement and is selling tickets to the event for $3.05 (Miamis area code is 305) in an effort to capture names, addresses and other information about potential voters and campaign donors. Clinton is taking a decidedly different approach. The lead-up to her campaign kickoff is a quiet one  no social media hints or off-the-record tips on where to show up with a satellite truck. She may get in with an online message, followed by a series of smaller, more intimate events across the country, according to aides. They arent worried that Rubios timeline  or any other announcement  would cut into coverage of their long-awaited event. Rubios aides were far more cognizant about the possibility that Clinton could release her video Sunday night, upstaging their meticulously scripted event. After some debate, Rubio and his team decided to stick with their plan, figuring a dueling announcement might actually work in their favor, allowing them to pocket an early fundraising boost by arguing he would be a strong rival to run against Clinton. Side-by-side media coverage of the two candidates would draw a beneficial contrast, argued another top aide, between a woman they see as an aging icon from the 1990s and a dynamic Hispanic who is expected to have a rowdy rally in Miami. That was Pauls thought, too. His team hoped Clinton would launch before their debut, allowing him to immediately begin campaigning as though it were the general election. Instead, he found himself answering questions about his temperament after being unable, or unwilling, to detail his policy positions in several contentious interviews. Aides to Clinton, Rubio and Paul all spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal campaign deliberations. While a strong launch hardly preordains campaign success, a smart debut can reap more than media buzz. Cruz raised $4 million in the eight days after his speech formally announcing his candidacy. He was the first to get in, too, avoiding what are likely to be diminishing returns as the field grows larger. Theyre going to come fast and furious, Brabender said. At some point its going to be increasingly hard to draw out a headline. Deciding on timing isnt just about avoiding collisions with other candidates or positioning for fundraising. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry made his debut in 2012 just six weeks after his team started preparing for his run. Four years later, Perry has spent months visiting early primary states, boning up on policy and carefully plotting his entry into the race. The timing of his entry into the race did not provide enough time to mount a successful campaign organization for the long haul, said Ray Sullivan, Perrys former communications director. Yet even with enough time to plan, success isnt guaranteed. Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr.s campaign launch in 2011 sought the patriotic backdrop of the Statue of Liberty in the same Jersey City, N.J. park where President Ronald Reagan opened his 1980 general election campaign. But the images of Huntsman were marred by a tour boat that passed by during his speech and planes buzzing overhead. His campaign never caught on with voters. Campaign launches can make or break a Presidential Campaign. Trust me! his daughter, MSNBC host Abby Huntsman, recently wrote on Twitter. How I wish we could redo that day for team Huntsman in 2012.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  It took Ted Cruz three months to raise $10 million for his campaign for president, a springtime sprint of $1,000-per-plate dinners, hundreds of handshakes and a stream of emails asking supporters to chip in a few bucks. One check, from one donor, topped those results. New York hedge fund magnate Robert Mercers $11 million gift to a group backing the Texas Republicans White House bid put him atop a tiny group of millionaires and billionaires whose contributions already dwarf those made by the tens of thousands of people who have given to their favorite presidential candidate. An Associated Press analysis of fundraising reports filed with federal regulators through Friday found that nearly 60 donations of a million dollars or more accounted for about a third of the more than $380 million brought in so far for the 2016 presidential election. Donors who gave at least $100,000 account for about half of all donations so far to candidates presidential committees and the super PACs that support them. The review covered contributions to outside groups that can accept checks of any size, known as super PACs, and to the formal campaigns, which are limited to accepting no more than $2,700 per donor. The tally includes donations from individuals, corporations and other organizations reflected in data filed with the Federal Election Commission as of Friday, the deadline for super PACs to report for the first six months of the year. That concentration of money from a small group of wealthy donors builds on a trend that began in 2012, the first presidential contest after a series of court rulings and regulatory steps that created the super PAC. They can openly support candidates but may not directly coordinate their actions with their campaigns. We have never seen an election like this, in which the wealthiest people in America are dominating the financing of the presidential election and as a consequence are creating enormous debts and obligations from the candidates who are receiving this financial support, said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a Washington-based group that wants to limit money in politics. Others see an upside to the rainmakers. Big money gives us more competitive elections by helping many more candidates spread their message, said David Keating, director of the Center for Competitive Politics, which advocates for fewer campaign finance limits. For any number of reasons, these donors are willing to give so generously. Some may have a business that stands to gain from an executive branch that changes how an industry is regulated, while others hope for plum administration assignments, such as a diplomatic post overseas or a cabinet position. Many say their contributions, which the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized as equivalent to free speech, merely reflect their intense belief in a particular candidate  and in the political system in general. Id think that the fact that Im willing to spend money in the public square rather than buying myself a toy would be considered a good thing, said Scott Banister, a Silicon Valley investor who gave $1.2 million to a super PAC helping Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul in the Republican presidential race. The voters still, at the end of the day, make the decision, he said. You can spend $1 billion trying to tell the voters to vote for a set of ideas they dont like, and they will still vote against the candidate. For Florida developer Al Hoffman, financial support of the states former governor, Jeb Bush, is personal. A longtime friend and political contributor to the Bush family, he gave $1 million to Bushs super PAC, contributing to its record-setting haul of $103 million in the first six months of the year. Hoffman was ambassador to Portugal during former President George W. Bushs second term. He said he sometimes offered Bush advice during his time as Floridas governor, but doesnt expect to influence a Jeb Bush administration. Id just like to see one, he said. While the existence of high-dollar donors is more pronounced on the Republican side, theyre also among those giving to the super PAC backing Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton. Seven donors of at least a million dollars accounted for almost half of the total collected by Priorities USA Action. Entertainment mogul Haim Saban and his wife, Cheryl, led with a $2 million gift, and hedge-fund billionaire George Soros, historically one of the Democratic Partys biggest givers, donated $1 million. But no one has capitalized on the new era of big money like Bush. After announcing plans to explore a presidential run in December, Bush embarked on a nearly seven-day-a-week travel schedule to raise money for his Right to Rise super PAC. Bush navigated limits on how candidates can raise money for super PACs by playing coy about his intentions. Now that he is officially a candidate, he has left Right to Rise in the hands of his trusted strategist and friend, Mike Murphy. Hes not alone in the use of super PACs to fuel a presidential run. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker are too new to the presidential contest, announcing only weeks ago, to have filed any reports about their campaigns finances. Yet super PACs that sprang up months ago to support them show their efforts will be financially viable: A group backing Christie raised $11 million, while two supporting Walker brought in $26 million. Such totals put them well ahead of Paul, former technology executive Carly Fiorina, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Sen. Rick Santorum  who all began their presidential campaigns in the spring. Cruzs super PACs, meanwhile, didnt just get the $11 million from Mercer. They also received a $10 million donation from Toby Neugebauer, an energy investor in Texas, while the Texas-based Wilks family pooled together a $15 million gift. Super PACs will spend as campaigns do, investing in polling and data sets, hiring employees in key states and buying pricey television and digital advertising, direct mailings and phone calls to voters. Their money will be important in early primary states, but also would allow those with deep-pocket backers to campaign beyond Iowa and New Hampshire. There are a handful of billionaires that are making viable individuals whose campaigns never would have gotten off the ground, said Paul S. Ryan, senior counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, which wants to tighten limits on money in politics. Some of these candidates will go much deeper into the primaries than they otherwise could, thanks only to this kind of money.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  Jim Webb, a decorated Vietnam veteran and accomplished novelist who became a fierce critic of the Iraq war in the Senate, announced Thursday that hes challenging Hillary Rodham Clinton and other rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination. Webb, in a statement posted on his campaign website, acknowledged he would face major hurdles but vowed to bring an outsiders voice to the 2016 race, dominated by Clinton. I understand the odds, particularly in todays political climate, where fair debate is so often drowned out by huge sums of money, Webb wrote. I know that more than one candidate in this process intends to raise at least a billion dollars. But the former Virginia senator added, We need to shake the hold of these shadow elites on our political process and find fresh answers to the nations problems. Webb, 69, was a Navy secretary under Republican President Ronald Reagan who became a Democrat in response to the Iraq war that he opposed, and Clinton supported. He surprised many fellow Democrats when he became the first major figure in the party to form a presidential exploratory committee in November. Webb has outlined a campaign message centered on helping working-class Americans compete in the economy, reworking the campaign finance system and preventing the U.S. from getting involved in foreign entanglements like Iraq and Afghanistan. Webb has made frequent trips to the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, but without the impact that Clinton brings to the race or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders unexpected success in raising campaign money and drawing crowds in his own longshot challenge. Also in the field: former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee. Webbs opposition to the Iraq war, in which his son Jimmy served, was key to his surprise Senate election in 2006 against Republican Sen. George Allen. While Webb chose not to seek re-election after one term, his military and foreign policy credentials could make him a debate-stage foil to Clinton, who served as President Barack Obamas secretary of state. He said in his statement that as president, he would not have urged the invasion of Iraq and, as senator, he would not have voted to authorize it in 2003, as Clinton did. Webb has said U.S. foreign policy has been adrift since the end of the Cold War and called for a new foreign policy doctrine that would outline the circumstances in which the U.S. would use military force. The ex-senator brings a unique perspective to the field. A graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, Webb served as a company commander in Vietnam and later wrote an acclaimed novel, Fields of Fire, about the war. At the end of the war, Webb became a Republican, worked in the Defense Department and served as Navy secretary at the end of the Reagan administration. But he opposed President George W. Bushs decision to invade Iraq in 2003 and was recruited by Democrats to challenge Allen in 2006. Webbs campaign was helped by an anti-Iraq war fervor and missteps by Allen, whose campaign imploded after he called a Democratic tracker macaca, an ethnic insult. In the Senate, Webb focused on foreign affairs and veterans issues and was the driving force behind a GI Bill for post-9/11 veterans seeking to attend college after returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. He announced he would not seek re-election in 2012 and returned to writing. Webb has said he needs to raise enough money to mount a viable campaign, which could be critical to competing with Clinton and Sanders. Assuming he raises enough money to make a difference, then he could bring a voice that is more appealing to moderate, more rural Democrats and champion their issues, said Jamal Simmons, a Democratic strategist. Given Webbs military background, if he chooses to take on Hillary Clinton on foreign policy, he could be a real thorn in her side.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  John Bolton, the former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. and one of the Republican Partys most prominent national security hawks, has confirmed that he will not run for president. In a media conference call and separate video to supporters, Bolton said he would work through his political action committees and PACs to influence the 2016 elections by pushing candidates to promote aggressive foreign and military policies. I believe I can make the strongest contribution to our future by continuing as a clear and consistent advocate for a strong, Reaganite foreign policy that values peace through strength, Bolton said in the video. But, he told reporters, his own campaign was not feasible, saying that an established political class in this country makes it harder for lesser-known candidates to compete seriously for the presidency. Im not complaining, he said, adding, Im a realist. A leading foreign policy voice in the George W. Bush White House, Bolton spent recent months testing his muscular foreign policy message in early voting states. He often lashed out at Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, as well as Republican rivals  Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul in particular  who favor a reduced U.S. military presence in the world. He blasted Clinton again Thursday, calling her tenure as President Barack Obamas first secretary of state a failure. Republicans need to make sure they dont allow her to skip away with using national security as an issue that works in her favor, he said. Bolton said he has no immediate plans to endorse any Republican. Boltons decision not to run is somewhat surprising in an election season in which more than a dozen ambitious Republicans may pursue a run for the nomination. Declared candidates include Paul, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, former technology executive Carly Fiorina and retired neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson. A slew of current and former governors, including Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, are expected to announce their plans in the coming weeks. Despite saying a campaign wasnt feasible, Bolton insisted that funding would have been there in an adequate amount. He noted that his political organizations spent about $7.5 million on House and Senate races in the 2014 midterm elections.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  John Catsimatidis, a Manhattan grocery chain owner, gave as much money as allowed to Hillary Rodham Clintons Democratic primary campaign. Two months later, he gave the same amount, $2,700, to Jeb Bush, her would-be Republican challenger. Ive been friends with both of their families for many, many years, he said. They both love America, and Id be happy if either of them won. The billionaire is one of at least 60 donors hedging their bets heading into 2016 by giving to presidential campaigns of both parties, an Associated Press review of federal campaign finance records found. While those contributions totaled only about $300,000, they are an odd wrinkle of presidential politics in a race expected to see 22 candidates vying for billions of dollars in contributions. Even more people  at least 350  gave to multiple candidates within the same party, the data show, reflecting a sense of uncertainty among the donor class eying a crowded Republican primary with no clear front-runner but an array of strong candidates, governors, senators and business leaders among them. The reports Wednesday to the Federal Election Commission represent the first detailed look into how hundreds of thousands of Americans have opened their wallets with the general election still a year and a half away. The campaign contribution reports so far cover the first three months of the presidential race. But they dont yet detail the expected hundreds of millions of dollars flowing into separate super PACs not directly controlled by the candidates. This election, donors can give a maximum of $2,700 to each candidates campaign, but they face no limits when it comes to writing checks for the super PACs specially tailored to boost candidates election chances. The 2016 presidential election has barely begun, and already donors have poured some $400 million into it, according to an Associated Press tally of FEC records and fundraising totals provided by just some of the groups that havent yet reported. The heavy giving will continue  and some of it will be strategically spread between both parties in hopes of building alliances with the eventual winner. A ruling last year by the Supreme Court means the bet-hedgers like Catsimatidis dont need to make up their minds anytime soon. Until then, contributors had to carefully choose which candidates and party committees they wanted to support because they were limited to giving a total of $123,000 apiece for each two-year election cycle. Thats no longer the case, providing a clearer path for people like Catsimatidis to spread their largess. I write so many checks, I forget who I write them to, Catsimatidis said. Campaign records show that he also gave to South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, both Republican presidential hopefuls. And he thinks he has forked over money to groups helping ex-Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walkers presidential ambitions, too, he says. Explaining why he favors many, rather than one, he said, My money gives them the ability to be heard by others. Candidate shopping, if money is any guide, sometimes means party-hopping. Thats how Shawn Seipler, founder of Clean the World, a Florida-based nonprofit company that recycles soap, found himself at fundraisers for Clinton  and, days later, Bush. He paid $500 to attend Clintons and $2,700 for Bushs. Theyre two of the leading candidates, and theyve both got some great messages and great agendas, said Seipler, a registered Republican who said he likes ideas in both parties and said he jumped at the chance to hear directly from them. If either of them became president, he said, Im happy. Hes also interested in a third contender: Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican whom hes met with the senators father. Kenneth Abramowitz, a New York investor who has given $1,500 or more to four different GOP candidates, said his donations are all tied to events. I want to meet them and hear them out, and I cant do that unless I pay to go, he said. He said he is not committed to any one of the primary contenders. Overall, the financial backers of both Clinton and Bush have given more than $176 million so far to their campaigns and the super PACs specially designed to boost them.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  Most Americans think the government should protect religious liberties over gay rights when the two come into conflict, a new Associated Press-GfK poll finds, though fewer think most businesses should be allowed to turn away gay couples because of religious beliefs. The survey uncovered nuanced views on gay rights as the Supreme Court considers, in a case heard this week, whether the Constitution gives same-sex couples the right to marry. Americans are more likely to say that religious liberties are more important for the government to protect than the rights of gays and lesbians, by a 56 percent to 40 percent margin, the poll found. Just a quarter of Americans call gay rights a very or extremely important issue to them personally, while half call religious liberties a very or extremely important issue. But fewer Americans  just 40 percent  think most business owners should be allowed to refuse service to gays and lesbians on religious grounds. That finding goes to the heart of the significant political fallout over Indianas Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which critics charged was intended to allow businesses discriminate against gays and lesbians. With public opinion apparently split, its an open question how gay rights will play in the 2016 campaign. Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Leadership Conference, said Republicans would be wise to make religious freedom a central issue because the broad debate highlights intolerance against Christians. Religious freedom will emerge as a centerpiece, and Democrats will have an impossible time defending against it, said Rodriguez, whose organization aligns with conservative Republicans on this issue. Others think the issue could be perilous for the GOP. Religious liberty works well with religious people, which is the GOPs base, but the argument is easily turned on its head when the issue is discrimination against gay people, said veteran Republican strategist John Feehery. I think the GOP is better off talking about economic security and national security, while leaving this particular issue to the courts to decide. Although only a minority of poll respondents thought businesses generally should be able to discriminate against gays or lesbians, support was stronger for letting wedding-related businesses in particular refuse service to same-sex couples  52 percent said so. That was down slightly since the beginning of February, when 57 percent said so in an earlier AP-GfK poll. The new poll found a distinct split between Republicans and Democrats on the issue. Most Democrats opposed any such discrimination by businesses; most Republicans thought businesses should have the right to refuse service, whether generally or for wedding matters. On marriage, just under half of Americans want it to be legal for gay and lesbian couples to wed in their states, while just over a third are opposed, according to the poll. There is a significant partisan divide over that issue, too, but it could be a moot point in the 2016 campaign if the Supreme Court affirms same-sex marriage. On the court case, 50 percent said the justices should rule that gay marriage must be legal nationwide; 48 percent said they should not. Kelly Huston, a retired autoworker from Newtown Falls, Ohio, says he doesnt object to gay marriage, just as he doesnt object to a business refusing to serve gay patrons. I think a business owner should decide what they want to do in their business, Huston said. Im not against gays. Im against the government telling people how to run their businesses. The issue could play differently in some regions than others. For example, the survey finds 60 percent of Southerners, but only 45 percent of Northeasterners or Westerners, say wedding-related businesses should be allowed to refuse service to gay couples. In New Hampshire, which hosts the nations first presidential primary election, a leading Republican official warns prospective candidates against a heavy focus on religious freedom. For the average Republican presidential primary voter in New Hampshire, thats not one of the top six or seven issues, said Steve Duprey, New Hampshires national Republican committeeman. I dont think theres anybody who could win the New Hampshire primary running on religious liberty.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  President Barack Obama is the man in the middle, caught between the White House aspirations of two of his closest advisers: Vice President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. For months, White House officials expected Clinton to be the Democratic nominee in the 2016 election. Some of Obamas top political advisers moved to New York to run her campaign and Obama appeared to give his tacit approval, saying she would be an excellent president. But that bet on Clinton suddenly looks less certain. With Biden weighing his own presidential run more seriously amid signs of weakness in Clintons campaign, the White House faces the prospect of a family feud over who will become heir to Obamas legacy. Certainly hes got something at stake here, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday of Obamas interest in the 2016 election. Bidens recent overtures to donors and Democratic officials have led to palpable awkwardness in the West Wing as aides  many with close ties to Clinton, the vice president or both  try to maintain impartiality. Earnest raised the prospect that Obama could endorse a candidate in the Democratic primary, though others close to the president say its unlikely hed publicly put his thumb on the scale if Clinton and Biden were locked in a close contest. In picking between Biden and Clinton, Obama would be making a choice between two of the most influential members of his administration. Obama and Clinton long ago turned their political rivalry from the 2008 primary into an alliance. Clinton left the administration in early 2013 after four years as Obamas secretary of state, but she and the president still get together for occasional meetings. They both attended a birthday party in Marthas Vineyard last week for Democratic powerbroker Vernon Jordan, and Obama played golf on the tony Massachusetts island with former President Bill Clinton. However, some White House officials were irked by revelations that Clinton sidestepped administration guidelines by using a private email account on her own computer server to do State Department business. Privately, some Obama allies also say theyre miffed at Clintons handling of the email controversy, which continues to dog her campaign. Meanwhile, Obama and Biden appear to have developed a genuine friendship during their six-and-a-half years in the White House. When Bidens son, Beau, died of brain cancer earlier this year, Obama delivered a moving eulogy in which he referred to the vice president as a brother. In the weeks after the younger Bidens death, Obama made sure the vice president was by his side for high-profile administration announcements. Earnest said Obama viewed his selection of Biden as a running mate as the smartest decision of his political career. I think that should give you some sense of the presidents view of Vice President Bidens aptitude for the top job, Earnest said. On Monday, Obama and Biden met for their weekly lunch in the presidents private dining room. Both men spent much of August on family vacations and their lunch marked their first in-person meeting since Biden stepped up his deliberations and outreach about a possible campaign. People familiar with Bidens thinking say hes yet to make a final decision, but is likely to announce his political future within a month. The vice president is consulting with a close circle of longtime advisers, though there are said to be divisions within that group about whether he should run. Those close to Obama and Biden insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the vice presidents deliberations or the White Houses view of the 2016 race. Of course, whats at stake for Obama in the 2016 election is more than just his personal relationships with Clinton and Biden. Much of his legacy is contingent on a Democratic president maintaining his policies on immigration, health care and climate change, as well as the nuclear agreement with Iran. Since announcing her candidacy in April, Clinton has largely backed Obamas policies. However, shes distanced herself from his decision to approve offshore oil drilling in the Artic and said she would have voted against his bid to get fast-track authority for an Asia-Pacific trade deal if she were still in the Senate. Clinton has more latitude than Biden in breaking with Obama policies given that her portfolio in the administration was largely limited to foreign affairs. The vice president, however, has been a central figure in wide-ranging administration policies and has been the point person on everything from the economic stimulus to gun control legislation to Ukraine. Biden, as the presidents partner, would be closely identified with the Obama legacy, said David Axelrod, a longtime Obama political adviser. However, he added that any Democrat will carry the benefits and burdens of Obama into this election. Some Democrats say Bidens strongest campaign strategy would be to cast himself as an economic populist. He met over the weekend with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a favorite of the Democratic Partys progressive wing whose support would be a major coup for Biden. Democrats say Biden supporters are also quietly reminding influential operatives and donors that the vice president was ahead of both Obama and Clinton on some issues that are now cornerstones for the party, including gay marriage.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  President Barack Obama may have finally shed his summer curse  just in time for a daunting fall. Unlike past summers, this years has been among the most productive stretches of Obamas presidency. Late June victories in the Supreme Court on health care and gay marriage, along with a win for his trade agenda on Capitol Hill, were followed by the landmark Iran nuclear deal in July and the raising of the U.S. flag over a new embassy in Cuba in August. Instead of being overshadowed by the 2016 presidential campaign, Obamas agenda has often been driving the debate among the candidates running to replace him. And yet to the president, one of his summers biggest successes may simply be making it through his annual vacation on the tony Massachusetts island of Marthas Vineyard largely uninterrupted. While his summer troubles have often trailed him on previous vacations, he closed out this years trip Sunday without any statements to the press or public appearances, beyond a few glimpses of him on the golf course and biking with his family. The president has absolutely appreciated the opportunity to take these two weeks outside of the hustle and bustle of Washington and spend some time with family and friends, White House spokesman Eric Schultz said. Once we return to Washington, our agenda is packed, so the president is grateful for some rest and relaxation in advance of what will be a very busy fall. Indeed, the president returned to Washington Sunday with a full schedule and confrontations with Congress that will help determine whether his summer momentum is sustained or sputters. Atop the presidents priorities is preventing Congress from blocking the Iran deal, which curbs Tehrans nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars in sanctions relief. Obama will likely have to veto a resolution of disapproval by lawmakers, blemishing his signature foreign policy initiative, but he appears on track to garner enough support from Democrats to hold off Republican override efforts. Obama is also hoping to avoid the second government shutdown of his presidency. Some conservative Republicans have threatened to hold up funding bills to keep the government open after Oct. 1 unless federal money for Planned Parenthood is cut. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. has dismissed the prospect of a shutdown, saying Weve been down this path before. Still, the issue has spilled into the 2016 presidential campaign, which will likely intensify the debate over linking government funding to the womens health organization. Seeking to bolster his legacy abroad, Obama will also be pushing for a global climate treaty and finalization of a free trade agreement with Asia-Pacific nations. His string of summer successes began with Congress agreeing to a fast-track approval process for the trade pact when negotiations are complete. September also holds a White House meeting with Pope Francis, a state visit for Chinese President Xi Jinping, where Beijings high-profile hacking will be on the agenda, and the presidents annual trip to New York for the United Nations General Assembly. For Obama, now deep in his second term, a busy, high-stakes agenda sure beats the alternative. His presidency appeared to be quickly slipping into lame-duck territory last year, but began to rebound after Democrats defeats in the midterm election and picked up momentum this summer. Summer has previously been Obamas cruelest season: the hostile health care town halls in 2009, the debt ceiling crisis in 2011, the presidents waffling on Syrias chemical weapons use in 2013. Last summer was consumed by the swift rise of the Islamic State and the groups gruesome beheading of Americans, as well as tensions in Ferguson, Missouri, after a white police officer fatally shot an 18-year-old black man. Free this year from an all-consuming crisis, the president spent most of the two-week summer vacation on the golf course, at the beach and dining out with his family. He also attended a party on the island thrown by Democratic power broker Vernon Jordan, who also hosted an event last year where Obama was spotted on the dance floor. But there were no images of Obama dancing this year. Perhaps in a sign that even a president riding high in his second term has a short shelf life, the band instead posted a video of a dancing Hillary Rodham Clinton, the top contender to be the next Democratic president.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  President Barack Obama says his executive actions blocking the deportation of millions living illegally in the U.S. go as far as the law allows. But Hillary Rodham Clinton says that if she becomes president, she would go even further. Clintons aggressive stance reinvigorates the debate over the scope of presidential powers, which has become a flashpoint in Washingtons politically fraught immigration fight. It also raises questions about the legality of Clintons proposals and sets up a potential conflict between the Democratic front-runner and the Obama White House. The president unveiled executive measures last fall that spare up to 5 million people, mostly parents and the young, from deportation. The administration also set new enforcement priorities that could make it easier for many more people in the U.S. illegally to stay in the country. Weve expanded my authorities under executive action and prosecutorial discretion as far as we can legally under the existing statute, the existing law, Obama said earlier this year. The presidents actions are largely on hold amid a court challenge filed by Texas and 25 other states. The states say Obamas action would force local governments to invest more in law enforcement, health care and education. Clinton, speaking to young immigrants in Nevada on Tuesday, vowed to protect Obamas actions, which could also be voided by future presidents. In a surprise to many supporters, Clinton added that she would move unilaterally to let even more people stay in the country if Congress didnt act on broad legislation. I would do everything possible under the law to go even further, Clinton said. She specifically raised the prospect of stemming deportations for parents of dreamers  those who were brought to the country illegally as children. They were not covered under Obamas executive actions. Obamas measures marked the most sweeping changes to the nations immigration system in nearly three decades and followed a fruitless six-year bid to get Congress to act on sweeping legislation. The status of the nations fractured immigration laws has become a top issue in recent presidential campaigns, in part because of the growing power of Hispanic voters. More than 70 percent of Hispanic voters backed Obama in the 2012 election. Clintons focus on immigration early in her campaign underscores her desire to maintain that advantage over Republican rivals, all of whom oppose Obamas use of presidential powers to block deportations. By supporting Barack Obamas lawless executive action, Hillary Clinton once again believes shes above the law, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said on Twitter. In 2012, Obama took unilateral action to allow some young people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children to stay in the country. He lifted some restrictions on that provision as part of last years executive actions. The new measures also allowed immigrants who have been in the U.S. illegally for more than five years but whose children are citizens or lawful permanent residents to stay in the country and get work permits after passing background checks and paying fees. White House and Homeland Security officials did consider extending those same protections to the parents of dreamers, the group Clinton cited in Nevada. However, officials said they determined Obama did not have the authority to take that step. On Wednesday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the president stands by his assertion that he has taken all action within his legal authority. Asked whether that meant Clinton was veering into questionable legal territory, Earnest said, That would be something for future presidents and future courts to decide. However, Clinton campaign officials say there is a way to expand deportation protections to the parents of dreamers under current law. Officials say that rather than broadly making parents eligible for deportation protections, Clinton  or any other possible president  could strengthen the system for individuals applying for deferrals and provide more specific guidelines for who should be allowed to stay. The officials insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of the policy proposal publicly by name. Its unclear whether Obama ever considered the action Clinton is proposing. Administration officials noted that parents of dreamers can currently seek deportation deferrals on an ad hoc basis. Marshall Fitz, vice president for immigration policy at the Center for American Progress, said Clintons proposals would give the individual deferral process a lot more transparency and availability to the broader undocumented population. Fitz, whose organization has close ties to both Obama and Clinton, said reforming the system could also increase the likelihood that same-sex partners of citizens and small-business owners with employees could be spared deportation.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  Presidential candidates are a common sight in Iowa as the 2016 campaign intensifies. But on Monday, the White House hopefuls will have some competition from the man theyre running to succeed. President Barack Obama will spend the afternoon in Des Moines, the capital of the kickoff caucus state that will be instrumental in winnowing down the 2016 primary field and ultimately picking a president in the general election. Officially, Obama will be in Iowa to join Education Secretary Arne Duncan for a back-to-school bus tour and to announce a change to the college financial aid system that will allow students to apply for assistance three months earlier. But the visit also allows Obama to make an imprint on the 2016 race, arguing for Democratic priorities and drawing a contrast with the many Republican candidates blanketing the state. The White House has been coy about Obamas choice of location for Mondays event. Spokesman Josh Earnest quipped to reporters that they may have some pre-deployed assets that could be used to cover the presidents trip to Des Moines  a reference to the bevy of national media that has descended on Iowa to cover the pre-caucus campaigning. But if Obama wanted to stay away from the campaign fray, he had plenty of other options for joining Duncans bus tour. Iowa is just one of seven states the secretary is visiting this week. Iowa is steeped with nostalgia for Obama. In 2008, he pulled off an upset win over challenger Hillary Rodham Clinton in the states kick-off caucus. On the eve of the 2012 election, he returned to Iowa for his final rally as a candidate, an emotional event held just steps from the site of his original campaign office in Des Moines. Clinton, who is again seeking the Democratic nomination, will be a few hours away from Des Moines Monday, holding campaign events in Cedar Falls and Decorah. The president and his former secretary of state are not expected to cross paths. Obama hasnt endorsed Clinton, though hes said she would be an excellent president. His spokesman has said the same of Vice President Joe Biden, who is contemplating a late entry into the Democratic race. The president has been less restrained in weighing in on the Republican contenders, calling them an interesting bunch and comparing them to a wacky uncle who joins the family at Thanksgiving. You still love him, hes still a member of your family, right? Obama said in July. But youve got to correct him, you dont want to put him in charge of stuff. Thats all Im saying. The president and his education secretary will hold a town hall at a Des Moines high school Monday. As part of the event, the president will unveil a change to the federal financial aid system that allows students to apply in October instead of January. The White House said requiring applicants to wait until January slows down the aid process and makes it harder for prospective students to determine whether they can afford to go to college.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe offered condolences Wednesday for Americans killed in World War II in the first address by a Japanese leader to a joint meeting of Congress, but stopped short of apologizing for wartime atrocities. Abe came to Capitol Hill after a morning visit to a Washington memorial to more than 400,000 American service members who died in the conflict. His remarks to a packed chamber a day after meeting President Barack Obama were warmly received by lawmakers. My dear friends, on behalf of Japan and the Japanese people, I offer with profound respect my eternal condolences to the souls of all American people that were lost during World War II, he said, prompting his audience to rise in applause. But he skirted another issue that some U.S. lawmakers had also been urging him to address in what is the 70th anniversary year of the end of war  the sexual slavery of tens of thousands of Asian women by Japans military, which remains a sore point with another staunch U.S. ally, South Korea. One of the few dozen surviving Korean victims, Yong Soo-lee, 87, was in the gallery to watch Abes address, seated in a wheelchair. Instead, the Japanese prime minister expressed feelings of deep remorse over the war. He acknowledged that our actions brought suffering to the peoples in Asian countries, we must not avert our eyes from that. That wont satisfy his critics, who want Abe to do more than uphold the apologies for wartime abuses made by his predecessors. Democratic Rep. Mike Honda, who invited Yong to attend, said it was shocking and shameful that Abe was evading his governments responsibility over atrocities committed by the Imperial Army against so-called comfort women. Since winning election in December 2012, Abe has been strong advocate of closer ties with the U.S. a message he hammered home Wednesday. He vowed to enact legislation by this summer to facilitate closer cooperation with the U.S. military, in support of new U.S.-Japan defense guidelines endorsed by the two leaders on Tuesday. Abe said the U.S. and Japan must take the lead in completing a 12-nation trans-Pacific trade pact. That got a lukewarm response from Democrats but warm applause from Republicans  reflecting the division in Congress on the issue. Abe has arrived amid a bruising battle in Washington over legislation that would give Obama the authority to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, a cornerstone of his second-term agenda. In a reversal of politics-as-usual, its Obamas own Democratic base that opposes him, and Republicans who support the deal. The TPP goes far beyond just economic benefits. It is also about our security. Long-term, its strategic value is awesome. We should never forget that, Abe said. The Japanese leader is a firm supporter of a stronger U.S. presence in the region, both militarily and economically, as China, which in recent years has eclipsed Japan as the worlds second-largest economy, asserts itself as a global power. Hes taken some political hits at home for pushing the trade pact and for loosening the restrictions of Japans pacifist constitution to open the way for Japans military to take a more active supporting role to the United States, which has nearly 50,000 troops based there. Dozens of Japanese leaders have visited the U.S. since the war, but Abes invitation to speak to Congress sets him apart from his predecessors. While past Japanese prime ministers  including Abes own grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, in 1957  have addressed the House, it was the first time for a leader of the East Asian nation to speak to both chambers. Republican Sen. John McCain said the speech was a historic recognition of two peoples reconciled with their shared history. He expressed gratitude for Abes recognition of American sacrifices in World War II. But Jan Thompson, president of the American Defenders of Bataan & Corregidor Memorial Society, which represents U.S. veterans who fought in the Philippines and were forced into slave labor in Japan, expressed disappointment. She said it was deeply disturbing that Abe had offered sympathy to victims of a war that Japan started, but did not acknowledge responsibility. Noting that Abe told lawmakers that history is harsh, she said she agreed, but added: history is ultimately harsher on those that deny it.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  Republicans lost Mondays Senate showdown over halting federal aid to Planned Parenthood. Yet the political offensive by abortion foes has just started, prompted by a batch of unsettling videos that has focused attention on the groups little-noticed practice of providing fetal tissue to researchers. Conservatives have long targeted Planned Parenthood, which provides health services, family planning and abortions in clinics across the country. The furtively recorded videos, with hair-raising close-ups of aborted fetal organs and Planned Parenthood officials dispassionately describing how Im not going to crush that part, have forced the group and its Democratic champions into a defensive crouch.

That would violate a federal criminal statute that lets providers recover only their expenses. They also say Planned Parenthood is altering abortion procedures to better recover usable tissue. Conservatives view the videos as a huge political opportunity to galvanize support for banning abortions and, some hope, prohibiting fetal tissue research. But the issue is cutting both ways, with both sides using it for fundraising solicitations. Planned Parenthood has apologized for comments in the video but says it has broken no laws. It accuses opponents of using selectively edited videos for their latest assault on abortion and womens health choices.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  Salaried workers who earn nearly $1,000 per week would become eligible for overtime pay under a proposal President Barack Obama unveiled Monday, lamenting that too many Americans are working too many hours for less pay than they deserve. The long-awaited overtime rule from the Labor Department would more than double the threshold at which employers can avoid paying overtime, from the current $455 a week to $970 a week by next year. That would mean salaried employees earning less than $50,440 a year would be assured overtime if they work more than 40 hours per week, up from the current $23,660 a year. Weve got to keep making sure hard work is rewarded, Obama wrote in an op-ed in The Huffington Post. Thats how America should do business. In this country, a hard days work deserves a fair days pay. To keep up with future inflation and wage growth, the proposal will peg the salary threshold at the 40th percentile of income, individuals familiar with the plan said. They requested anonymity to discuss the proposal ahead of the official announcement. The president was to promote the proposal during a visit Thursday to La Crosse, Wisconsin. Obamas proposal aims to narrow a loophole that the president has long said some employers exploit to avoid paying overtime. Employees who make above the salary threshold can be denied overtime if they are deemed managers. Some work grueling schedules at fast food chains and retail stores, but with no overtime eligibility, their pay may be lower per hour than many workers they supervise. The existing salary cap, established in 2004 under President George W. Bush, has been eroded by inflation and now relegates a family of four making just above the cap into poverty territory. Obama has long charged that the level is too low and undercuts the intent of the overtime law. The proposed changes will be open for public comment and could take months to finalize. They can be enacted through regulation, without approval by the Republican-led Congress. Although the Labor Departments estimates suggest the proposal would raise wages for 5 million people, other estimates are far higher. The Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, recently estimated that a threshold of $984 a week would cover 15 million people. This is by definition middle-class people. This reverses decades of neglect, said EPI President Larry Mishel, adding that the proposal would also likely create jobs for hourly workers. Under the current threshold, only about 8 percent of salaried workers are eligible for 1 times their regular pay when they work overtime. The EPI estimates that doubling the salary level would make up to 40 percent of salaried workers eligible. Yet many Republicans have opposed Obamas plans to increase the threshold, arguing that doing so would discourage companies from creating jobs and dampen economic growth. Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who chairs the Senates labor panel, has derided the idea as designed to make it as unappealing as possible for companies to create jobs. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said Monday that Obamas plan will negatively impact small businesses and drastically limit employment opportunities. Additionally, many reclassified employees will lose benefits, flexibility, status and opportunities for advancement. Chamber senior vice president Randy Johnson said the Obama administration is completely divorced from reality. Obama, in his op-ed, argued the exemption was intended for highly paid, white-collar employees but now punished lower-income workers because the government has failed to update the regulations. He said the proposal would be good not only for workers but also for employers that pay their employees what they deserve, because they will no longer be undercut by competitors who pay their workers less. Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do exceptionally well? Or will we push for an economy where every American who works hard can contribute to and benefit from our success? Obama said, setting up a populist argument that Democrats are likely to embrace in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. The beneficiaries would be people like Brittany Swa, 30, a former manager of a Chipotle restaurant in Denver. As a management trainee, she started as an entry-level crew member in March 2010. After several months she began working as an apprentice, which required a minimum 50-hour work week. Yet her duties changed little. She had a key to the shop and could make bank deposits, but otherwise spent nearly all her time preparing orders and working the cash register. She frequently worked 60 hours a week but didnt get overtime because she earned $36,000. The grueling hours continued after she was promoted to store manager in October 2010. She left two years later and has joined a class-action lawsuit against Chipotle, charging that apprentices shouldnt be classified as managers exempt from overtime. A spokesman for Chipotle declined to comment on the case.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  Seeking to avert a government shutdown, Republican leaders drove a bill blocking Planned Parenthoods federal funds through the House on Friday, hoping to contain conservatives demands for a politically risky showdown with President Barack Obama by striking a quick blow against abortion. The nearly party-line 241-187 vote followed a no-holds-barred debate that included a graphic, poster-sized photo of a scarred, aborted fetus and underscored how abortion has resurfaced as a white-hot political issue. The battle has been rejoined just in time for the 2016 election campaign and next weeks historic address to Congress by Pope Francis. The issues re-emergence followed the release of secretly recorded videos of Planned Parenthood officials offhandedly discussing how they sometimes procure tissue from aborted fetuses for medical research. The anti-abortion activists who made the videos say they show that Planned Parenthood is illegally profiting from fetal organ sales. , After House vote, its Seattle Planned Parenthoods turn for symbolism, What does it say about this Congress that today were here on the House floor debating the killing and harvesting of aborted babies? said Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind. How can there possibly be two sides to this?, Democrats said the true GOP goal was to whip up conservative voters with legislation that would make it harder for women to get health care. Planned Parenthood, whose clinics provide sexual disease tests, contraception and abortion, says its done nothing illegal and is being victimized by misleadingly edited videos. Republicans are willing to risk womens lives just to score political points, said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. who chairs the Democratic National Committee. Enough is enough. Planned Parenthood gets around $450 million yearly in federal payments, mostly Medicaid reimbursements for handling low-income patients. Thats around one-third of the organizations $1.3 billion annual budget. Practically none of the federal money can be used for abortions. Beyond Fridays bill, some conservatives want to attach language halting Planned Parenthoods payments to broader legislation financing government agencies, which otherwise run out of money next Thursday. Those Republicans say a shutdown fight would at least produce a veto battle that would show voters where Republicans stand. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, a long-time abortion foe, and virtually all House Republicans favor halting the flow of federal dollars to Planned Parenthood. But Boehner and other GOP leaders say a shutdown battle would be fruitless because they lack enough votes to prevail in the Senate or overcome an Obama veto. They say voters oppose a shutdown and would punish the GOP in next years elections if one occurred. GOP leaders efforts to avoid a shutdown were explicitly endorsed Friday by the nations most powerful anti-abortion group. Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, said in a written statement that a shutdown would cause political damage to our allies by angering the public, adding, The grim fact is this: In order to defund Planned Parenthood, we must have a pro-life president. Long unhappy with Boehner and other GOP leaders for not being confrontational enough, some in his party have threatened to force a House vote on removing him from his post if he backs down on this or other upcoming fights over federal borrowing and spending. The legislation approved Friday, proposed by Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn. would end federal payments to Planned Parenthood for a year, diverting the money to thousands of community health centers. Republicans say those clinics could handle the displaced Planned Parenthood patients, but Democrats say the centers are overburdened and sometimes distant. Pressure from conservatives may ultimately force leaders to let Congress vote anyway on a bill that would avert a shutdown and stop Planned Parenthoods federal dollars, a measure certain to die in the Senate. Once defeated, that would likely be followed by a measure temporarily financing government, perhaps into December, that would include Planned Parenthood funds and buy time to resolve disputes over spending, abortion and other issues. For now, Republican leaders are hoping that investigations by four congressional committees and other anti-abortion bills will relieve some pressure. Along those lines, the House voted 248-177 Friday for another measure, this one by Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz. that would impose penalties of up to five years in prison plus fines on doctors who dont try to save infants born alive during abortions. And the Senate set a vote for Tuesday on a measure banning most late-term abortions. Both of those bills would face likely Senate defeat and an Obama veto threat. In Fridays House debate, both sides showed plenty of fight on the issue. Franks, who brought the fetus poster to the floor, said Congress response to the Planned Parenthood videos is vital to everything those lying out in Arlington Cemetery died to save. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. asked, In the face of these videos, with all the alternatives women have for health, why would you want to force your constituents to pay for something so evil?, Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill. said Republicans relying on deceptively edited videos had manufactured a witch hunt. Added Rep. Sam Farr, D-Calif. Stop being so mean. Solve problems, do not create them.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  Sen. Ron Johnson was elected to Congress in 2010 as an adamant foe of President Barack Obamas health care overhaul. Yet facing a Supreme Court decision that could disrupt how that law functions, the Wisconsin Republican is among many in the GOP who want Congress to react with caution. If the plaintiffs prevail in the Republican-supported case, the justices could annul federal subsidies helping around 7.7 million people afford coverage in more than 30 states. Republicans broadly agree that Congress should respond by temporarily replacing that aid, aware that abruptly ending it would anger millions of voters before next years presidential and congressional elections. Neither politically nor practically can we end those subsidies, said Johnson, who faces a potentially tough re-election next year. So lets just recognize those realities. Lets set up the 2016 election as the contest, the discussion, the debate over repealing the law. And while Republicans say they are dedicated to repealing the law, they remain divided over how to respond once the court rules. Johnsons is among five GOP proposals  and counting  suggested so far, and none have won a consensus. I think it needs to be part of the presidential campaign, and then the winner will be able to point to that as part of their mandate, No. 2 Senate GOP leader John Cornyn of Texas said of replacing the health care law. Meanwhile, he said, what we all need to do is unite around one approach, if thats at all possible, and thats been a challenge because there are competing good ideas out there. The divisions underscore the challenge Republicans face between satisfying conservative supporters who want the law dismantled and providing help should millions lose their ability to afford coverage. But the sheer existence of the GOP proposals could help in court because it might suggest to the justices that despite Democrats claims that eliminating the subsidies would spark health insurance chaos, Congress is already working on ways to avoid that. Johnsons plan would extend the current subsidies until August 2017 but also eliminate the coverage requirements for individuals and employers, which Obama considers key parts of the law and would be unlikely to accept. His proposal has attracted 31 co-sponsors including the Senates top GOP leaders. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo. is helping to craft a plan he says would temporarily protect people who lose subsidies and eliminate the laws requirements that individuals buy coverage and that companies cover their workers. Conservative freshman Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb. has introduced narrower legislation replacing the current subsidies with a new tax credit that would be phased out over 18 months as Congress worked on a broader response. Some conservatives prefer to focus on repeal. One large group of House conservatives led by Rep. Bill Flores, R-Texas, is writing a plan expected to revoke the entire law and instead provide new health care tax deductions for families. What did we tell the voters last November? We told them were committed to getting rid of this law, said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a leading House conservative. Put it on the presidents desk, actually make him veto it. Republicans will be able to use special budget rules this year shielding legislation addressing the health law from Senate filibusters, which take 60 votes  a difficult hurdle  to end. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. says that once the court has ruled, GOP leaders will decide whether to use that process to send Obama legislation repealing the health care overhaul or addressing the justices ruling. Ryan, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, is working on one replacement bill with other lawmakers. I dont think the guy named Obama will sign a law repealing Obamacare, said Ryan, using a nickname for the law. He said if the court annuls the subsidies, what happens? And thats where its open-ended. The House voted in February to repeal the health care law, as it has dozens of times since 2011. The Senate hasnt voted on repeal yet. Such a vote could be difficult for the half-dozen GOP senators facing competitive re-election fights in closely divided or Democratic-leaning states in 2016, when Senate control will be at stake. The court should rule by late June. Plaintiffs say the Obama administration is unlawfully providing subsidies to people buying health coverage in the 37 states using healthcare.gov, the federally run insurance marketplace. They say the laws language limits those subsidies to people purchasing policies on the 13 state-run insurance exchanges. Of the 11.7 million Americans enrolling for health coverage through government-established marketplaces for 2015, nearly 9 million bought it in states using federally run exchanges, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Of those 9 million, around 7.7 million qualified for subsidies, which they receive as tax credits. Supporters say the law was intended to provide subsidies in all states. They say eliminating the payments would make many people drop coverage, driving up premiums for everyone else because only the sickest and most expensive recipients would retain their policies.]", "Date": "20150430", "Title": "[GOP divided as Supreme Court ruling on health care law nears]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/gop-divided-as-supreme-court-ruling-on-health-care-law-nears/", "Author": "[ALAN FRAM]"}

He immediately endorsed brash New York Sen. Chuck Schumer to succeed him as leader of a party desperate to regain the Senate majority. Reid, 75, rose from hardscrabble beginnings in Nevada, and brought his amateur boxers tenacity to the pinnacle of congressional politics. Friends said his doggedness and indifference to popularity helped rebuff Republicans who fiercely oppose Obama on health care, spending, immigration and other issues. But critics say Reid added to Washingtons poisonous partisanship, particularly by changing Senate filibuster rules in 2013 to enable Obama to appoint more judges. On Friday, Schumer seized the inside track to succeed Reid as the Democratic Senate leader after next years elections. Potential rival Dick Durbin of Illinois said he would back Schumer. Durbin is currently Reids No. 2; Schumer is No. 3. Stylistically, Reid and Schumer are miles apart. Schumer is voluble, outgoing, eager to talk campaign strategy, on TV or anywhere else. He sometimes works with Republicans, including an ultimately unsuccessful effort to overhaul immigration laws in 2013.

He headed the partys Senate campaign operations in 2006 and 2008, when Democrats made sizable gains. Colleagues gratitude helped him surpass Durbin as Reids likely successor. Schumer, who spent much of Friday phoning fellow Democratic senators, said in a statement he was humbled to have the support of so many of my colleagues. Durbin said he hopes to retain the second-ranking leadership post, known as party whip. Allies of Sen. Patty Murray of Washington said she might also seek that job. Reid, who came to Congress in 1982, lost his role as Senate majority leader when last falls elections swept Republicans into power. He suffered serious eye and facial injuries on New Years Day while exercising at his Nevada home. He typically has won Nevada elections by narrow margins, and Republicans were heavily targeting him in 2016. Both parties now plan all-out bids for his open seat. In a video statement Friday, Reid said Democrats must retake the Senate majority and it is inappropriate for me to soak up all those resources while remaining the caucus leader. Obama called Reid a fighter who pushed for jobs, better health care and a safer environment. He also called the senator a friend, but the two arent exactly cozy. Obama has circumvented Reid to negotiate some tough budget deals with Republicans. In a break with protocol, Reids chief of staff publicly suggested Obamas low popularity hurt Democrats in the 2014 elections. Reid, however, saves his sharpest barbs for Republicans. After calling then-President George W. Bush a liar and a loser, Reid apologized for the loser comment but not the liar. He once told Bush, Your dog is fat. Reid grew up in the tiny town of Searchlight, Nevada. His mother sometimes took in laundry for pay. His father, a miner, committed suicide when Reid was 32. Seemingly best-suited for black-and-white photos, Reid rarely appears at Washington dinners or on TV talk shows. His voice is so mumbling and low that reporters strain to hear him. Fellow Democrats chose him as their leader for his institutional knowledge, listening skills and tenacity. Briefly holding a 60-seat, filibuster-proof majority after the 2008 elections, congressional Democrats  led by Rep. Nancy Pelosi in the House, and Reid in the Senate  muscled Obamas Affordable Care Act to enactment, without a single Republican vote. Other times, however, Obama and Pelosi worked around Reid. That was largely the case in resolving the 2013 fiscal cliff dilemma. When negotiations ground to a halt, raising the possibility of tax hikes on nearly all working Americans, Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky crafted a compromise with minimal input from Reid. While never wildly popular with voters, Reid is a canny campaign strategist. Facing a potentially potent GOP opponent in 2000, Reid helped a less experienced tea party-affiliated Republican win the nomination. Then he comfortably beat her in the general election. On Friday, Reid endorsed former Nevada attorney general Catherine Cortez Masto to run for his seat next year. Democratic Rep. Dina Titus said she also is weighing a bid. Unworried about picking favorites, Reid told KNPR radio, Ive never been a shrinking violet. Many Nevada Republicans would like to see Gov. Brian Sandoval run for the Senate seat, but he gave little encouragement Friday. Other GOP possibilities are Rep. Joe Heck and former Lt. Gov. Brian Krolicki. Most tributes to Reid on Friday, regardless of political party, used words like fighter to describe him. Harry Reid has always been a tough advocate for the people of Nevada, and I have always appreciated the candid and straightforward nature of our relationship, said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Reids brusqueness has hit many targets over the years. Acquaintances say he often ends phone calls without goodbye. In 2013 he clashed with his leadership predecessor  Tom Daschle of South Dakota  over an open Senate seat in that state. Reid wanted a former congresswoman to run, while Daschle wanted a former aide. Daschles choice prevailed but lost the general election last November to Republican Mike Rounds in a strongly pro-GOP year. Despite the tension, Daschle praised Reid on Friday. He had a very, very difficult job, Daschle said in an interview. This is a challenging time for anyone in political leadership. Daschle said Reid was justified in changing the filibuster rules in 2013, calling it probably inevitable.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  Ted Cruzs presidential campaign has raised more than $14 million since the Texas senator launched his bid for the Republican presidential nomination just over three months ago, his campaign said Sunday. The money comes from more than 120,000 donors who made an average contribution of $81. Some donors gave more than once. Presidential candidates are required to report detailed fundraising figures though the end of June to the Federal Election Commission by mid-July, but Cruz is among a handful of contenders who have announced overall totals ahead of the disclosure date. Republican Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon and political novice, will report having raised $8.3 million for his presidential candidacy, his campaign said on Wednesday. On the Democratic side, front runner Hillary Rodham Clinton will report having raised $45 million. Cruz was the first major Republican to wade into the GOP primary, which will soon have 16 formally declared candidates. After his March 23 announcement at Liberty University in Virginia, his campaign raised just over $4 million in the final week of that month. Since then, hes collected another $10 million, his campaign said. Cruz also transferred $250,000 from his Senate campaign to his presidential campaign, according to documents filed with the FEC. The grassroots energy and support we are seeing is overwhelming, Cruz said in a statement. Cruz also will benefit from several super PACs that are supporting him and can raise money without contribution limits. Those groups have previously said they have raised $37 million.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  The 11 million Americans who receive Social Security disability face steep benefit cuts next year, the government said Wednesday, handing lawmakers a fiscal and political crisis in the middle of a presidential campaign. The trustees who oversee Social Security and Medicare said the disability trust fund will run out of money in late 2016. That would trigger an automatic 19 percent cut in benefits, unless Congress acts. The average monthly benefit for disabled workers and their families is $1,017. The typical beneficiary would see a reduction of $193 a month. Todays report shows that we must seek meaningful, in some instances even urgent, changes to ensure the program is on stable ground for future generations, said Jo Ann Jenkins, the chief executive officer of AARP. In more bad news for beneficiaries, the trustees project there will be no cost-of-living increase in benefits at the end of the year. It would mark only the third year without an increase since automatic adjustments were adopted in 1975. Separately, about 7 million Medicare beneficiaries could face a monthly premium increase of at least $54 for outpatient coverage. That works out to an increase of more than 50 percent. The annual report card on the financial health of Social Security and Medicare shows that the federal governments largest benefit programs are feeling the strain of aging baby boomers as they both approach milestone anniversaries. Medicare turns 50 at the end of the month and Social Security turns 80 two weeks later. Together, the programs accounted for more than 40 percent of federal spending last year. There was some good news in the report: The trustees said Social Securitys retirement fund has enough money to pay full benefits until 2035, a year later than they predicted last year. At that point, Social Security will collect enough in payroll taxes to pay about 75 percent of benefits. Medicares giant hospital trust fund is projected to be exhausted in 2030, the same date as last years report. At that point, Medicare taxes would be enough to pay 86 percent of benefits. Advocates for seniors say that gives policymakers plenty of time to address both programs without cutting benefits. But some in Congress note that the longer lawmakers wait, the harder it gets to address the shortfall without making significant changes. There is an easy fix available for the disability program: Congress could shift tax revenue from Social Securitys much larger retirement fund, as it has done in the past. President Barack Obama supports the move. And acting Social Security Commissioner Carolyn Colvin said shifting the tax revenue would have no adverse effect on the solvency of the overall Social Security program. But Republicans say they want changes in the disability program to reduce fraud and to encourage disabled workers to re-enter the work force. Washington has continually kicked the can down the road, and now, as 11 million Americans face cuts to Social Security disability benefits they rely on, it is time for Congress to take action, said Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio. In January, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. suggested that a lot of slackers are on disability. Paul, who is running for president, joked that half the people getting benefits are either anxious or their back hurts. The date that the disability fund will run dry is unchanged from last years report. But as the deadline gets closer, advocates say the need to act becomes more urgent. The president has proposed a commonsense solution to improve the solvency of this fund in the short run so that Americans who rely on it will continue to receive the benefits they need, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said. It is vital that Congress move forward to maintain the integrity of this critical program sooner rather than later. If the retirement and disability funds were combined, they would have enough money to pay full benefits until 2034, the trustees said. Lew noted that the life of the Medicare trust fund has been extended by 13 years since Congress passed Obamas health law. The fund is also benefiting from a slowdown in the rise of health care costs. The Medicare premium increases would affect Part B, which provides coverage for outpatient services. For about 70 percent of beneficiaries, premium increases cannot exceed the dollar amount of their Social Security cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA. Because no COLA is currently expected for next year, increased costs of outpatient coverage would have to be spread among the remaining 30 percent. That would result in an increase of about $54 in the base premium, bringing it to $159.30 a month. Those who would feel the impact include 2.8 million new beneficiaries, 1.6 million who pay the premium directly instead of having it deducted from their Social Security, and 3.1 million upper income beneficiaries, those making at least $85,000 for an individual and $170,000 for a married couple. The increases for upper-income beneficiaries would be higher, up to $174 for those in the highest bracket. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell said no final decision has been made. She said premium increases are expected to average under 5 percent a year over the long term. Nearly 60 million people receive Social Security benefits, including 42 million retired workers and dependents, 11 million disabled workers and 6 million survivors of deceased workers. About 55 million retirees and disabled people get Medicare. The hospital trust fund is only part of the program. Coverage for outpatient care and prescription drugs is covered by premiums and other government spending.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  The Senate muscled its way into President Barack Obamas talks to curb Irans nuclear program, overwhelmingly backing legislation Thursday that would let Congress review and possibly reject any final deal with Tehran. The vote was 98-1 for the bipartisan bill that would give Congress a say on what could be a historic accord that the United States and five other nations are trying to finalize with Iran. Under the agreement, Iran would roll back its nuclear program in exchange for relief from crippling economy penalties. The lone no vote came from freshman Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. who wants the administration to submit any agreement to the Senate as a treaty. Under the Constitution, that would require approval of two-thirds of the Senate. The House is expected to vote next week on the measure. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a statement moments after the vote that the goal is to stop a bad agreement that could pave the way to a nuclear-armed Iran, set off a regional nuclear arms race, and strengthen and legitimize the government of Iran. White House spokesman Eric Shultz said Obama would sign the bill in its current form. But the spokesman added that Obama has made it clear that if amendments are added by the House that would endanger a deal coming together that prevented Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, that wed oppose it. Even if Congress rejects his final nuclear deal with Tehran, however, Obama could use his executive pen to offer a hefty portion of sanctions relief on his own. He could take unilateral actions that  when coupled with European and U.N. sanctions relief  would allow a deal to be implemented. The U.S. and other nations negotiating with Tehran have long suspected that Irans nuclear program is secretly aimed at atomic weapons capability. Tehran insists the program is entirely devoted to civilian purposes. The talks resume next week in Vienna, with a target date of June 30 for a final agreement. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. said the bill offers the best chance for our constituents through the Congress they elect to weigh in on the White House negotiations with Iran. Added Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee: No bill. No review. The legislation would bar Obama from waiving congressional sanctions for at least 30 days while lawmakers examine any final deal. The bill would stipulate that if senators disapprove of the deal, Obama would lose his current power to waive certain economic penalties Congress has imposed on Iran. The bill would require Congress to pass a resolution of disapproval to reject the deal, an action that Obama almost certainly would veto. Congress then would have to muster votes from two-thirds of each chamber to override the veto. In the House, about 150 Democrats  enough to sustain a veto  wrote the president to express their strong support for the nuclear negotiations with Iran. We urge you to stay the course, the letter said. We must allow our negotiating team the space and time necessary to build on the progress made in the political framework and turn it into a long-term, verifiable agreement. The bill took a roller coaster ride to passage. Obama first threatened to veto it. Then he said he would sign it if the measure was free of amendments the White House believed would make continued negotiations with Tehran virtually impossible. It survived a blow from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who stood before Congress in March and warned the U.S. that an emerging nuclear agreement would pave Irans path to atomic weapons. It is a very bad deal. We are better off without it, he said in a speech arranged by Republicans. His address aggravated strained relations with Obama and gambled with the long-standing bipartisan congressional support for Israel. A few days later, Cotton and 46 of his GOP colleagues wrote a letter warning Iranian leaders that any deal with Obama could expire when he leaves office in January 2017. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada accused the GOP of trying to undermine the commander in chief while empowering the ayatollahs who lead Iran. In April, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a compromise bill on a 19-0 vote. Obama withdrew his veto threat. But Republicans were not done trying to change the bill, drawing up more than 60 amendments. One, from Cotton, would have made any deal contingent on Irans halting its support of terrorist activities that threaten Americans. Cotton used an unusual Senate procedural move to get his amendment heard. McConnell did not want to see the bill end in tatters, so he acted to end the amendment process and have votes on the legislation. We should have insisted on amendments to put real teeth in this bill, said Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who is running for president. Ultimately, I voted yes on final passage because it may delay, slightly, President Obamas ability to lift the Iran sanctions and it ensures we will have a congressional debate on the merits of the Iran deal. Another 2016 candidate, Sen. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. said the bill puts Congress in a better position than having no say. At a minimum, at least it creates a process whereby the American people through their representatives can debate an issue of extraordinary importance, Rubio said.]", "Date": "20150507", "Title": "[Senate OKs bill giving Congress review of Iran nuclear deal]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/senate-oks-bill-giving-congress-review-of-iran-nuclear-deal/", "Author": "[DEB RIECHMANN]"}
{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  Theyre called managers, and they sometimes work grueling schedules at fast food chains and retail stores. But with no overtime eligibility, their pay may be lower per hour than many workers they supervise. With those employees in mind, the Obama administration is proposing making up to 5 million more people eligible for overtime  its latest effort to boost pay for lower-income workers. These workers would benefit from rules requiring businesses to pay eligible employees 1 times their regular pay for any work beyond 40 hours a week. White House says President Obamas proposed overtime rule would extend OT to 90,000 additional workers in WA , Weve got to keep making sure hard work is rewarded, President Barack Obama wrote in an op-ed published Monday in The Huffington Post. Thats how America should do business. In this country, a hard days work deserves a fair days pay. Employers can now often get around the rules: Any salaried employee whos paid more than $455 a week  or $23,660 a year  can be called a manager, given limited supervisory duties and made ineligible for overtime. Yet that would put a family of four in poverty. Obama says that the level is too low and undercuts the intent of the overtime law. The threshold was last updated in 2004 and has been eroded by inflation. In 1975, overtime rules covered 65 percent of salaried workers. Today, its just 8 percent, the White House says. The long-awaited overtime rule from the Labor Department would more than double the threshold at which employers can avoid paying overtime, to $970 a week by next year. That would mean salaried employees earning less than $50,440 a year would be assured overtime if they work more than 40 hours per week. Labor Secretary Tom Perez said Tuesday that the change would add $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in wages for many newly overtime-eligible workers. Others, Perez said, will benefit from employers reducing their hours. At the same time, he said, some employers may choose to hire new full-time or part-time workers to conduct the work salaried workers had once performed. To keep up with future inflation and wage growth, the proposal will peg the salary threshold at the 40th percentile of income. The White House said 56 percent of those who would benefit in the first year are women, and 53 percent have a college degree. The beneficiaries would be people like Brittany Swa, 30, a former manager of a Chipotle restaurant in Denver. As a management trainee, she started as an entry-level crew member in March 2010. After several months she began working as an apprentice, which required a minimum 50-hour work week. Yet her duties changed little. She had a key to the shop and could make bank deposits, but otherwise spent nearly all her time preparing orders and working the cash register. She frequently worked 60 hours a week but didnt get overtime because she earned $36,000. The grueling hours continued after she was promoted to store manager in October 2010. She left two years later and now processes workers compensation claims at Travelers. She makes $60,000 a year, which is surprising, since I only work 40 hours a week, she says. Swa has joined a class-action lawsuit against Chipotle, which charges that apprentices shouldnt be classified as managers exempt from overtime. A spokesman for Chipotle declined to comment on the case. Dawn Hughey, a former store manager for Dollar General in Flint, Michigan, would have also benefited from a higher overtime threshold. Hughey worked 60 to 80 hours a week for about two years before being fired in 2011. She was paid $34,700. I missed a lot of family functions working like that, Hughey said. It was just expected if you were a store manager. She made about $45,000 a year as an hourly worker in a previous job at a Rite Aid in California, where she typically worked 48 hours a week and received overtime. The White Houses proposed changes will be open for public comment and finalized sometime next year. They set up a populist economic argument that Democrats have already been embracing in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is challenging Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Democratic nomination, said the proposal means businesses would no longer be able to shirk their responsibility to pay fair wages. This long overdue change in overtime rules is a step in the right direction and good news for workers, Sanders said. The proposed changes will face opposition from the business community and many Republicans, who argue that they discourage hiring. Our research shows that  few workers would actually see more take-home pay, David French, a senior vice president at the National Retail Federation, said. There simply isnt any magic pot of money that lets employers pay more just because the government says so. The NRF says its members would probably respond by converting many salaried workers to hourly status, which could cost them benefits such as paid vacation. Other salaried workers would have their hours cut and wouldnt receive higher pay, the group says. __, Associated Press writers Josh Lederman and Jim Kuhnhenn contributed to this report. __, Follow Chris Rugaber on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/ChrisRugaber]", "Date": "20150630", "Title": "[Boosting overtime: Obama calls for broader coverage]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/business/more-overtime-on-the-way-obama-proposes-broader-coverage/", "Author": "[CHRISTOPHER S.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  Think of it as tweeting for dollars. The social media service Twitter on Tuesday introduced a feature that enables political candidates and advocacy groups to raise money directly via its mobile application, making it quicker and easier to harvest small donations from followers. Campaigns already aggressively use Twitter to spread their message, particularly during live political events such as Wednesday nights Republican presidential debate. The company says that tweets about the August 6 debates on Fox News were viewed more than 1 billion times on Twitter and across the web. And in a race likely to cost more than the $2 billion spent in 2012, why not look for cash in every corner?, At least a dozen presidential candidates will begin using the new fundraising technique right away, said Jenna Golden, Twitters director of political ad sales. Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders and Republicans Scott Walker and Rick Santorum were among the first to use the new feature Tuesday morning. Walkers campaign wrote on Twitter, Show Scott Walker some support going into the second debate by donating $2. While the White House seekers are early adopters, Golden said the fundraising service is also available to local and state-level candidates. We think about donating to a campaign as an old-fashioned, traditional process, a cumbersome process, she said. This was an incredible opportunity for us to simplify and streamline. Political candidates have been able to raise money through Twitter by linking to the web-based online donation forms. But for people on mobile devices  and thats 80 percent of Twitters audience  it can be clunky to click through different applications and web pages. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, among the savviest digital fundraisers in the GOP presidential field, has tweeted links to campaign swag, including a red T-shirt that says, The NSA knows I bought this Rand Paul t-shirt. His campaign and the Democratic National Committee are among the groups that say theyll make use of Twitters new in-message fundraising. The DNC is interested in the new tool because we think it will help give people a chance to show their support without taking them away from one of the platforms where theyre getting their information, said Matt Compton, the groups digital director. Twitter is working with Square Inc. a financial services company, to collect the money and the information that the Federal Election Commission requires from political donors. Would-be givers fill in their identifying information and link to a debit card. Several clicks later, the Twitter users contribution is headed straight for the candidate of their choice, and they can share news of their financial support to their own Twitter followers. The candidates also can pay Twitter to promote their fundraising-linked tweets. Twitter has been a successful avenue of fundraising for campaigns in the past, and this will make it even more attractive to campaigns as they look at how to allocate precious dollars, said Vincent Harris, a digital strategist for the Paul campaign.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  To some Republican presidential candidates, its better to be with the popular pope than against him. Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz have deep policy differences with Pope Francis, but the senators will break off campaign travel to attend his address to Congress later this month, a centerpiece of his eagerly anticipated visit to the United States. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a devout Catholic, will attend Mass with Francis in Washington. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, another Catholic candidate, plans to attend one of the popes East Coast events. Regardless of what the pope says or emphasizes, the simple fact of being associated with his visit is still significant for a candidate, said David Campbell, a professor at the University of Notre Dame who studies religion and politics. The images are very powerful. Francis has become one of the worlds most popular figures since his 2013 election to the papacy, drawing praise for his humility and efforts to refocus the church on the poor and needy. He also has become involved in numerous hot-button political issues, often staking out positions that put him at odds with Republicans. The pope supports the Iran nuclear deal, which many GOP candidates pledge to tear up if they are elected president. As Republicans debate the place of immigrants in the U.S. the pope has urged countries to welcome those seeking refuge and has decried the inhuman conditions facing people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. Francis was also instrumental in secret talks to restore diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba, a rapprochement the GOP views as a premature reward for the islands repressive government. In a heated primary where any break from party orthodoxy is a political risk, Republican candidates have stepped gingerly around their differences with Francis. When Francis issued an encyclical this year calling for aggressive international action to combat climate change, most Republicans made clear they had no problem with pope taking a position on the matter. But they suggested his stance would have little influence on their own views. He is a moral authority and as a moral authority is reminding us of our obligation to be good caretakers of the planet, Rubio, a practicing Catholic, said at the time. Im a political leader and my job as a policymaker is to act in the common good. Bush, who was raised Episcopalian and converted to Catholicism as an adult, said it was best to leave climate change in the realm of politics, not religion. During a campaign stop Thursday in New Hampshire, Bush called the pope an amazing man and welcomed his emphasis on mercy and compassion. I think hes going to lift peoples spirits up, Bush said of the popes visit to the U.S. Were in a time where theres a lot of vulgarity and a lot of insults and a lot of just coarseness in our discourse. Im not talking about politics, either. Im talking about everyday life. And heres a man who comes with a gentle soul, and I think it might be really healthy for our country to hear someone speak the way he does. Not all GOP candidates plan to attend events with the pope. Among them are Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, whose spokeswoman said he didnt expect to be in Washington during Francis visit, and Rick Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator and devout Catholic, who was scheduled to be on a campaign trip to Iowa. American politicians have long struggled with how to balance their policy positions with the views of the Vatican. For Democrats, the focus has often been on the gulf between the partys support for abortion rights and the churchs stern and contrary view. After John Kerry, a Catholic who backs abortion rights, captured the Democratic nomination in 2004, a top Vatican official issued a statement saying priests must deny Communion to politicians who hold that position. Francis has taken a more conciliatory tone on abortion, as well as homosexuality, but hasnt changed church doctrine. President George W. Bush found himself at odds with the Vatican over the Iraq war. Both Pope John Paul II and his successor Benedict XVI vehemently opposed the war, yet each met Bush during their tenure. Charles Camosy, a theology professor at Fordham University, said that in interactions between politicians and popes, politics is put aside and theres respect shown. Still, the timing of the popes visit  in the heart of fall primary campaigning  and his own schedule will make politics difficult to avoid. Francis will hold an Oval Office meeting Sept. 23 with Obama, who has highlighted areas where his agenda overlaps with the popes priorities, including income inequality. The pope will speak the following day on Capitol Hill, where at least some of the focus will be on the reaction to his remarks from the presidential candidates sitting in the audience. The popes message in Washington is expected to touch on some of the issues that are sources of disagreement with Republicans, though its unlikely he will insert himself directly into presidential politics. Still, as Campbell, the Notre Dame professor, noted, One thing weve learned about Pope Francis is that hes very unpredictable.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  Try as she might to focus on the policies she wants to enact if elected president, Hillary Rodham Clinton just cant dig out of her inbox. Clintons email problems are getting worse. She agreed to turn over her private server to the Justice Department this week on the same day Congress got word that at least two emails that traversed the device while she was secretary of state contained information that warranted one of the governments highest levels of classification. The developments suggest the investigation into the security of Clintons email setup could run deep into 2016, as she is trying to win the Democratic nomination for president and, potentially, the general election. Clinton campaign aides argue theres nothing for investigators to find, and the State Department says its not yet clear if the material at issue ought to be considered classified at all. What worries Clintons team is the lingering whiff of political scandal in a tightening primary race, and they pushed back hard on Wednesday, trying their best to dismiss the matter as nothing more than politics. Look, this kind of nonsense comes with the territory of running for president. We know it, Hillary knows it, and we expect it to continue from now until Election Day, campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri wrote in an email to campaign supporters. While her Democratic rivals have yet to seize on the issue, it has become a major part of the GOP case against Clinton. I think its about time that she dealt with the consequences of this, said GOP candidate and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. This is something that isnt just a matter of her not being able to tell the truth; this is something that has put national security at risk and highly questions her ability to be the commander in chief of the United States. Clintons campaign said she would turn over the server just hours after she wrapped up two days of campaigning in New Hampshire, where she outlined a plan to address college affordability and student loan debt  a centerpiece proposal of her policy platform. The announcement about her email server, which got much more attention than her college affordability plan, marked a retreat for Clinton. She had previously refused the request of a House committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, that the server be turned over to a third-party arbiter. Clintons attorney said then the server had been wiped clean and no emails remained on the device. The reversal comes as her chief Democratic rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, is drawing some of the largest crowds of the presidential primaries. A self-described democratic socialist, Sanders has avoided addressing Clintons email saga, keeping focused on policy disagreements over the economy, trade and the Keystone XL pipeline. From our perspective, we want to keep this about Bernie and his message, said Sanders campaign strategist Tad Devine. He added, If you look at the polling, people are coming to the view that this is not an inevitable nomination anymore. Recent polls have shown a tighter race between Clinton and Sanders in the early contests of Iowa and New Hampshire than many expected, and Vice President Joe Biden  vacationing this week in South Carolina  has indicated that he will make a decision on whether to get into the race next month. The email controversy, aides and supporters argue, wont change existing views of a candidate who has spent decades in the political spotlight. I dont think it really hurts her one way or another, said Jan Bauer, the Democratic chair in Story County, Iowa, who is backing Clinton. And Terry Shumaker, a longtime supporter in New Hampshire, said the issue didnt come up during Clintons campaigning in the state this week. People were free to ask about anything, and nobody asked about emails, he said. Clinton said in March she had exchanged about 60,000 emails during her four years in the Obama administration, about half of which were personal and deleted. She turned over the others to the State Department, which is reviewing and releasing them on a monthly basis. The next batch, on Aug. 31, will come two days after Clinton and her primary challengers are scheduled to address members of the Democratic National Committee in Minneapolis. The final installment, on Jan. 29, 2016, will arrive three days before the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1. Each will give Republicans another opportunity to remind voters of the issue, as Rep. Darrell Issa did Wednesday, saying Clinton should be investigated criminally. If any other American had shown the same disregard for securing classified information that Hillary Clinton showed, the United States government would move quickly and decisively to hold them responsible, he said in a statement. A referral from the inspector general of the intelligence community to the Justice Department that led to the current investigation did not allege any criminal wrongdoing, and Clintons attorney has said federal authorities simply want assurances that the emails continue to be properly stored. Even so, the rules covering the release of classified material are subject to interpretation and nuance. The Justice Department has been criticized by defense lawyers and secrecy experts alike for an approach they say is inconsistent. Some of those same concerns are likely to be resurrected as Clintons server is inspected. I think people assume that the classification system is a rigorous and perfectly logical set of rules, but its not. It is a fuzzy subjective system that lends itself to conflicting interpretations said Steven Aftergood, a government secrecy expert at the Federation of American Scientists.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  Two days after Congress let the phone-records collection and several other anti-terror programs expire, the Senates 67-32 vote sent the legislation to President Barack Obama, who signed it Tuesday night. This legislation will strengthen civil liberty safeguards and provide greater public confidence in these programs, Obama said in a statement. Officials said it could take at least several days to restart the collection. The legislation will revive most of the programs the Senate had allowed to lapse in a dizzying collision of presidential politics and national security policy. But the authorization will undergo major changes, the legacy of agency contractor Edward Snowdens explosive revelations two years ago about domestic spying by the government. Questions and answers about newly approved USA Freedom Act, McConnells role in surveillance bill bewilders his friends, In an unusual shifting of alliances, the legislation passed with the support of Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, but over the strong opposition of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. McConnell failed to persuade the Senate to extend the current law unchanged, and came up short in a last-ditch effort Tuesday to amend the House version, as nearly a dozen of his own Republicans abandoned him in a series of votes. This is a step in the wrong direction, a frustrated McConnell said on the Senate floor ahead of the Senates final vote to approve the House version, dubbed the USA Freedom Act. He said the legislation does not enhance the privacy protections of American citizens. And it surely undermines American security by taking one more tool form our warfighters at exactly the wrong time. The legislation remakes the most controversial aspect of the USA Patriot Act  the once-secret bulk collection program that allows the National Security Agency to sweep up Americans phone records and comb through them for ties to international terrorists. Over six months the NSA would lose the power to collect and store those records, but the government still could gain court orders to obtain data connected to specific numbers from the phone companies, which typically store them for 18 months. It would also continue other post-9/11 surveillance provisions that lapsed Sunday night, and which are considered more effective than the phone-data collection program. These include the FBIs authority to gather business records in terrorism and espionage investigations and to more easily eavesdrop on suspects who are discarding cellphones to avoid surveillance. In order to restart collection of phone records, the Justice Department will need to obtain a new order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. This legislation is critical to keeping Americans safe from terrorism and protecting their civil liberties, Boehner said. I applaud the Senate for renewing our nations foreign intelligence capabilities, and Im pleased this measure will now head to the presidents desk for his signature. The outcome capped a dramatic series of events on Capitol Hill that saw a presidential candidate, GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, defy fellow Republicans and singlehandedly force the existing law to lapse Sunday at midnight, leading to dire warnings of threats to America. The suspense continued Tuesday as McConnell tried to get the Senate to go along with three amendments he said would make the House bill more palatable. But House leaders warned that if presented with the changes the House might not be able to approve them. The Senate denied McConnells attempts, an embarrassment for the leader six months after Republicans retook Senate control. The changes sought by McConnell included lengthening the phase-out period of the bulk records program from six months to a year; requiring the director of national intelligence to certify that the NSA can effectively search records held by the phone companies; and making phone companies notify the government if they change their policy on how long they hold the records. Most controversially, McConnell would have weakened the power of a new panel of outside experts created to advise the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The final vote divided Senate Republicans, with 23 voting yes and 30 voting no, and senators seeking re-election in 2016 split on the issue. Among GOP presidential candidates, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas was the only yes vote, while Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida joined Paul in opposing the bill. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who announced for president Monday, was absent. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is running on the Democratic side, also voted no. Civil liberties groups have been mixed on the legislation, but the American Civil Liberties Union applauded the vote, with Deputy Legal Director Jameel Jaffer calling it a milestone. Snowden, now in Russia and reviled by lawmakers of both parties, addressed the vote via video link during an event hosted by Amnesty International. He said the legislation was historic because Americans are questioning long-held assumptions that intelligence officials always act in their best interest. For the first time in recent history, we found that despite the claims of government, the public made the final decision and that is a radical change we should seize on, we should value and we should push forward, he said.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  Vice President Joe Bidens reluctance to enter the presidential race centers on his family. His wife, Jill, has never relished political life and is said to share his misgivings about whether the Bidens are emotionally equipped for another campaign. Those close to the second lady say she wont stand in the way of her husbands political ambitions, but her feelings about a White House bid are a major factor in Bidens decision. Only three months after losing their son, Beau, to brain cancer, the 72-year-old Biden appeared somber and weary at an Atlanta synagogue Thursday night as he pondered his familys readiness. The honest-to-God answer is I just dont know, he said. While the vice presidents deliberations have played out in semi-public fashion, Jill Bidens have taken place away from the spotlight. She has yet to discuss in detail with her staff her views on a possible presidential run. But she has been looking out for her husband and echoing his concerns about whether he can completely devote himself to a hard-fought campaign, according to several people who have spoken to her in recent weeks. Some of these people demanded anonymity because they didnt feel comfortable publicly discussing the familys private deliberations. Sonia Sloan, a Biden family friend since the 1970s who volunteered for his past campaigns, said she saw the Bidens at a mutual friends funeral a few weeks ago and that their grief was just written all over them. Beau was always a part of those deliberations, and they are grieving terribly, Sloan said. When hes run in the past, the familys been a very active part. This time, given the situation, it will be a really long, thoughtful process. Jill Biden campaigned actively for her husband when he ran in 2008, and then when he joined President Barack Obamas winning ticket. As second lady, she has played a visible role promoting education and military families. Said her spokesman, James Gleeson: Anyone speculating about Dr. Biden is only doing just that  speculating. She previously has said her husband would make an excellent president, Gleeson noted, adding that she will continue to support him in his career, as he has always supported Dr. Biden in hers. Speculation about a late entrance by Biden has spiked in recent weeks as he has actively explored the possibility of jumping in. Such a move would reshuffle the Democratic primary at a time when some in the party are concerned about Hillary Rodham Clintons campaign struggles and pine for more options. Forty-five percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted Biden to run in a Gallup poll last month. Biden has been speaking with donors, longtime supporters and potential endorsers as aides and friends tally how much money they might be able to raise for a campaign and how quickly. He and his advisers have told potential supporters that if he were to run, he would not attack Clinton, despite persistent questions about her use of a private email account and server while secretary of state. He has to make a really difficult decision, Clinton said in an interview with NBC News on Friday. You can see him struggling with it and I just wish the best for him and his family. If he gets into this race, there will be plenty of time to get into the debate and the back and forth. Biden, in his most extensive public remarks on his deliberations, said Thursday it would come down to his familys emotional outlook  not on practical considerations like the other candidates standing and building a viable campaign organization. The factor is can I do it. Can my family undertake what is an arduous commitment that wed be proud to undertake in ordinary circumstances? Biden said. Weighing heavily is Beaus wish, conveyed before his death, for his father to run. Another son, Hunter, has been among those reaching out to potential supporters. And sister Valerie Biden Owens, who led previous campaigns, has been intimately involved with the discussions, aides said. After Bidens wife and infant daughter died in a 1972 car crash, Jill Biden adopted Beau and Hunter. In 2008, Beau Biden corrected NBCs Ann Curry when she referred to Jill Biden as his stepmother. My mom, he interjected. Asked whether she was his fathers top adviser, Beau Biden added, I call her his number one partner. And it covers all facets. A community college professor and former high school teacher, Jill Biden has never hid her lack of enthusiasm for life in the public spotlight, despite supporting her husbands career. In his 2007 book, Promises to Keep, Biden said his wife was sensitive to the demands of a presidential campaign before he ran in 1988 and told him their childrens lives would surely change. She has continued teaching full time throughout his vice presidency, maintaining her own life in addition to her work as second lady. She says her students inspire her, Biden said Thursday, noting that she returned to the classroom two weeks ago. Shes a tough, smart, compassionate woman who cares about him and about the family, said Mark Gitenstein, a former U.S. ambassador and Biden friend who worked for him in the Senate. About Bidens family, Gitenstein said, He wont do something they dont want to do, and they wont do something he doesnt want to do.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  When Hillary Rodham Clinton takes the stage at fundraisers thrown by a group that wants to elect her president, shes not presented as a White House candidate. Shes a special guest. When Jeb Bush raises money for a group preparing to run major parts of his all-but-certain presidential campaign, he doesnt ask for the cash himself. And the hundreds of millions these groups will raise? They have to spend it without talking strategy with the candidates and campaigns they support. The groups are called super PACs, and their influence in selecting the next president will be without precedent. Born out of two Supreme Court decisions in 2010, they are governed by rules some see as a game of winks and nods, enforced by an agency bedeviled by partisan gridlock. As with most things in Washington, theres not even agreement on whether they are a problem to solve, or are a solution to celebrate. Whats really going on largely is a breakdown of the enforcement system of the campaign finance laws, says Craig Holman of the left-leaning consumer group Public Citizen. The Federal Election Commission is just broken. Counters David Keating of the right-leaning Center for Competitive Politics, I think this is overblown. The line has been drawn: Its the First Amendment. So if people want to speak, let them. The primary benefit for campaigns of the super PACs is that they can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to advocate for and against candidates, with only a few rules holding them back. Among the rules is a ban on campaigns and super PACs working together. They cannot discuss political strategy or share key information such as internal polling. While candidates can attend super PAC events, they cannot technically ask for the unlimited donations that make the groups such a powerful force. Most of these super PACs that are going to be spending millions of dollars, I think they have a good understanding of what the law is, Keating said. But even should they break the rules, there are questions about what price they might pay. The six commissioners of the Federal Election Commission are split evenly between Republicans and Democrats, and they have only once cited someone for breaking the rules. In February, the campaign manager for a failed Virginia Republican congressional candidate pleaded guilty to funneling money illegally from a super PAC to bolster his campaign. Clinton has decried the existence of unaccounted money in politics and has suggested a constitutional amendment to overturn the case that helped usher in the new system. Yet during a California fundraising trip last week, she took her first steps to embrace Priorities USA Action, a Democratic super PAC that helped support President Barack Obama in 2012. Like other candidates, Clinton cannot legally ask donors to give more than $5,000 to the group. But she can appear as a special guest. Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, has headlined Priorities events in the past. On the Republican side, Bush is taking it even further. The former Florida governor is preparing to delegate many of the operations of his expected campaign to his allied Right to Rise super PAC, using the group to produce campaign ads, conduct voter data analysis and run get-out-the-vote efforts. Mike Murphy, one of Bushs closest political advisers, is expected to lead the super PAC and is intimately involved in Bushs current operation, where he guides staffing decisions, courts donors and shapes political strategy. Bush takes care to say hes not yet a candidate, allowing him to work with Murphy and the super PAC in a way that wont be allowed once hes in the race. A dozen White House prospects are already benefiting from allied super PACs, which are frequently led by former political advisers and business partners. For example, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul will benefit from a super PAC run by his former campaign manager, who is also married to Pauls niece. Texas Sen. Ted Cruzs college roommate is working prominently in a network of four allied super PACs, while a longtime friend and financial backer, Dathan Voelter, is the treasurer. Voelter said the pro-Cruz groups have already raised more than $31 million. During his run for re-election in 2012, Obama never really warmed up to the super PAC world and the group supporting him, Priorities USA Action. He declined to appear at fundraising events even though his opponent, Republican Mitt Romney, frequently attended gatherings held by Restore Our Future, a pro-Romney super PAC. Seeking to succeed Obama in the White House, Clinton and her allies have taken steps recently to strengthen Priorities USA Action. Among them: She will appear at the groups events and reach out to potential donors, something Obama declined to do. The group is also bringing aboard Guy Cecil, a former staffer on Clintons 2008 presidential campaign who remains close to Bill Clinton and previously worked for a firm stocked with longtime Clinton advisers.]", "Date": "20150511", "Title": "[Super PACs rise in influence in 2016 campaign]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation-politics/super-pacs-rise-in-influence-in-2016-campaign/", "Author": "[KEN THOMAS, STEVE PEOPLES]"}
{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  When Jeb Bush said he wasnt sure the country needs to spend a half billion dollars for womens health issues, many viewed the remark as a gaffe and the Republican candidate for president rushed to clean it up. A week later, its all but forgotten  thanks to Donald Trump. The billionaire businessman cracked a joke during last weeks GOP debate when asked about calling some women fat pigs and disgusting animals, later said he couldnt remember using such words, and then attacked the popular female Fox News host who questioned his history of making such insults. Next to Trump, the other Republican candidates look like Gloria Steinem, said Penny Young Nance, president of the conservative Concerned Women for America. Amid a concern the Trump tsunami may be hurting the GOPs standing with women, there is also a worry for Democrats who initially viewed his rhetoric as a net positive for their party. Some now fear his bluster has made others in the GOP field appear moderate by comparison and could affect the partys ability to maintain a hold on a voting bloc thats probably critical to winning the White House. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clintons team has tried to emphasize the records of other Republican candidates in recent days, highlighting their opposition to abortion rights and their calls to defund womens health services offered by Planned Parenthood. It hasnt been easy. At a Monday news conference in New Hampshire, Clinton fielded seven questions about Trump, trying again and again to refocus the conversation on the anti-abortion platforms of other Republicans. What a lot of the men on that stage in that debate said was offensive. And I want people to understand, if you just focus on maybe the biggest showman on the stage, you lose the thread here, Clinton said. Well let the Republicans go back and forth with each other, but I want to point out, theres really not that much difference in the policies they are proposing when it comes to women, she added. Republican leaders acknowledged the need to improve the GOPs standing among women, who constituted 53 percent of the national electorate in 2012 and have favored Democrats in every presidential election in the last quarter century. Successful Republican candidates have won only by limiting Democrats advantage with women. President Barack Obama, for example, won women by 11 percentage points over Republican Mitt Romney in 2012, according to exit polls. The GOPs last successful candidate, President George W. Bush, lost women by just 3 percentage points in 2004. While some people are excited by fat jokes and stupid jokes, I think there are a lot of people in the general election, independents as well as probably many of the women voters, who arent really that entertained by this, said GOP presidential candidate Rand Paul, also a Kentucky senator. Trump may have garnered the most attention, but several Republicans candidates have emphasized priorities that could alienate women in recent weeks, including escalating attacks on Planned Parenthood. Republicans have seized on videos secretly recorded by anti-abortion rights activists that show Planned Parenthood officials clinically describing how they sometimes provide fetal tissue to medical researchers. The organization has said its staff has not engaged in any wrongdoing or agreed to violate any legal or medical standards. While such criticism is popular among conservative primary voters who are adamantly opposed to abortion, its unclear how the argument will resonate in 2016 with independents and moderates, many women among them, who are likely to decide the general election. In last weeks debate, Rubio said he had never advocated for bans on abortion that include exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. Polls suggest Rubios position is out of line with the overwhelming majority of voters. This is really good, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said after watching Rubios response. Heading into 2016, GOP officials hoped to feature women in prominent positions, in line with recommendations from a post-election report compiled by the Republican National Committee after Romneys loss to Obama. Yet the GOPs only female presidential candidate, former technology executive Carly Fiorina, did not qualify for the partys prime-time debate last week. Democrats, of course, feature Clinton, who aims to be the first nations first female president. Our party has some work to do, said Katie Packer Gage, a former Romney aide who leads a political firm that helps Republicans connect with women. On Trump, she said, most people do see him as a bit of a sexist and misogynist but that most of the Republican candidates are trying to figure it out relative to connecting with women. Trump tried to turn the tables during a Tuesday interview on CNN, charging that hed address womens health issues better than his Republican rivals. While he opposes abortion rights, Trump favors exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. He added that Bush should apologize to women for last weeks criticism of the cost of womens health care. Bush said shortly after the comment that he misspoke. I will be so good to women, Trump said. I cherish women.

{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON (AP)  Wherever their summer travels have taken them, Supreme Court justices probably will weigh in on Texas plans to execute two death row inmates in the week ahead. If past practice is any guide, the court is much more likely to allow the lethal-injection executions to proceed than to halt them. Opponents of the death penalty took heart when Justices Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg made the case against capital punishment in late June as arbitrary, prone to mistakes and time-consuming. Even if death penalty opponents eventually succeed, the timeline for abolition probably will be measured in years, not months. Thats because Breyer, joined by Ginsburg, was writing in dissent in a case involving death row inmates in Oklahoma, and five sitting justices, a majority of the court, believe it is settled that capital punishment is constitutional, as Justice Samuel Alito wrote in his opinion for the court in that same case. Texas has scheduled back-to-back executions Wednesday and Thursday for Daniel Lee Lopez and Tracy Lane Beatty. Lopez was convicted of running over a Texas police officer with his car during a high-speed chase. Lopez lawyer already has asked the court to stop the execution. Beatty strangled his 62-year-old mother, then stole her car and drained her bank accounts. He has an appeal pending in lower courts and could also end up at the Supreme Court. The justices rarely issue last-minute reprieves to death-row inmates. Even after Breyers opinion calling for a re-examination of capital punishment by the Supreme Court, no justice publicly backed a Missouri inmates plea to halt his execution to allow the court to take up the constitutionality of the death penalty. Similarly, the three Oklahoma inmates who lost their high court case now face execution in September and October and want the justices to reconsider the decision from June in light of Breyers dissent. The court almost never does that. The heightened attention on the death penalty comes amid declining use of capital punishment in the United States, and a sharp drop in the number of death penalty prosecutions. The 18 executions that have taken place so far this year have been carried out in just five states  Texas, Missouri, Georgia, Florida and Oklahoma. Nine of those were in Texas. Twelve states with the death penalty have not had an execution in more than five years. That list includes California and Pennsylvania, which between them have more than 900 death row inmates. The relatively small number of states that actively seek to carry out death sentences underscores what Ginsburg characterized in late July as the luck of the draw. If you happen to commit a crime in one county in Louisiana, the chances you will get the death penalty are very high. On the other hand, if you commit the same deed in Minnesota, the chances are almost nil, she said at a Duke University law school event in Washington. Texas is far and away the leader in carrying out executions, but it too has seen a drop in the number of new inmates on its death row. No new death sentences have been imposed in Texas this year, said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. Geographic disparity was among several defects Breyer and Ginsburg identified in June. Another is the length of time many inmates spend living under a sentence of death, which Breyer had previously suggested also might be a violation of the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Six of the 18 men who have been executed in 2015 spent at least 20 years on death row, including one who served 31 years before his execution. Yet for all the systemic problems opponents of capital punishment can cite, they also have to reckon with what death penalty opponent Michael Meltsner called the world of brutality and the awful capacity of people to commit violent crimes. One example: The Justice Department, which has otherwise advocated for criminal justice reforms during the Obama administration, won a death sentence in the case of convicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. When awful things happen, people dont think about the costs and benefits. They react to circumstances. There is an ambivalence that has tracked the death penalty debate for many years, said Meltsner, a Northeastern University law professor and experienced civil rights lawyer. Among the questions surrounding the possibility that the Supreme Court would take up the constitutionality of the death penalty is the makeup of the court itself. With four justices in their late 70s or early 80s, the next president might have the chance to fill several vacancies and could change the courts direction. Obviously, the composition of the court matters greatly and the biggest unknown variable about the life of the American death penalty is the presidential election of 2016. My expected time frame for constitutional abolition varies greatly based on the result, said Jordan Steiker, a University of Texas law professor. It took Breyer and Ginsburg more than 20 years on the Supreme Court to voice their doubt about capital punishment. Justices Harry Blackmun and John Paul Stevens likewise spoke out at the very end of their time on the court. Steiker said he thinks Breyers dissent will serve as a road map for death penalty lawyers and future justices who may not feel constrained to wait before grappling with executions. It was invigorating to those whod like to see constitutional abolition, he said. The arguments not new, but they had not been marshaled as effectively by a justice until this opinion.]", "Date": "20150810", "Title": "[Executions likely go on despite strong Supreme Court dissent]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/executions-likely-go-on-despite-strong-supreme-court-dissent/", "Author": "[MARK SHERMAN]"}
{"Content": "[ WASHINGTON , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus victory in this weeks Israeli elections has reverberated through U.S. politics, reinforcing Republican faith in the political wisdom of a hawkish foreign policy, worsening his already bad relationship with President Obama and energizing liberal critics of Israels government. But mostly it has complicated the life of Hillary Rodham Clinton. As she moves closer to making her campaign for president official, Clinton now faces a deepening polarization among Jewish Democrats over Netanyahu and how the United States should deal with his government. Clinton, the former secretary of state who has long advocated a two-state solution and once took credit for starting what were then secret talks for an Iran nuclear deal that Netanyahu vehemently opposes, is now likely to be under increased pressure from her own party to speak up against a government that is openly hostile to Obama.  But if she criticizes Israel, she risks prompting an influential segment of more conservative Jewish Democrats to withhold their support from her presidential campaign, or even to defect to a Republican candidate in 2016. Everyone is now going to have to pick a side, said Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, a liberal Jewish lobby that has for years been advocating Obamas positions on Israel and which is hosting its annual conference this weekend. That included the woman at the forefront of the Democratic Party, he said, who would undergo more and more pressure. In contrast to the praise heaped on Netanyahu by virtually the entire field of prospective Republican candidates, Clinton has declined to comment on the Israeli election. Up until this point, Clinton has essentially shrugged off the criticism of liberals over Israels government, and ignored the emboldened fringe of progressive Jews who have advocated boycotting Israel to protest its settlement growth and wars in Gaza. Last summer she made light of her time as Obamas designated yeller at the State Department, a title she earned, in part, because of her upbraiding of Netanyahu in 2010 after he announced new settlements during a visit by Vice President Joe Biden. She then articulated a vigorous defense of Israel during last summers war in Gaza and since then has generally avoided public displays of empathy for the Palestinian losses that upset her liberal Jewish supporters. If I were the prime minister of Israel, youre damn right I would expect to have control over security on the West Bank, she told The Atlantic in August. Such muscular remarks about the defense of Israel are standard procedure for a Democratic presidential candidate. The overwhelming percentage of Jewish voters, and donors, are liberal and will never vote for a Republican. The progressives who are bothered by Israels right-wing government care a lot more about other issues, such as the economy and social issues. Support for Israels conservative government is strong among what people close to her estimate to be about a 10 percent sliver of wealthy and influential moderate Democratic Jews for whom Israel is a priority, and could be a reason to withhold their financial backing, if not support a Republican candidate. But the anger generated by Netanyahus appearance before Congress and the other events that led up to his re-election will probably mean that more Democrats will be less willing to bite their tongue when it comes to criticizing his government. A statement Thursday by the Conservative movements Rabbinical Assembly, which is traditionally a reliable defender of the Israeli government, condemned the prime ministers campaign rhetoric. That suggests an expanded space, and perhaps tolerance, for criticism of Israel and another consideration for Clinton as she formulates her response. This isnt going away, acknowledged one person close to Clinton. Not everyone subscribed to the notion that Jewish Democrats were being torn asunder by Netanyahu. Josh Block, president of the Israel Project, a pro-Israeli education group in Washington, blamed the Obama administration for manufacturing the tension to distract from the nuclear negotiations and progressive partisans for trying to exploit and exaggerate the tensions for their own political gains. Still, Jewish elected officials in the Democratic Party describe a nightmare scenario in which traditional supporters of Israel will receive primary challenges from candidates now openly critical of the Israeli government. Polls show that Israel is increasingly unpopular with African-American, Latino and young voters  a key portion of the Democratic base. Officials fear that an erosion of support for Israel in the party could cause insecurity among Jewish voters, forcing them to seek comfort in the eager embrace of the Republican Party. For now, Jewish voters are overwhelmingly Democratic and liberal. But for Republicans, and especially the partys neoconservatives, Netanyahus victory was a good omen. It will strengthen the hawkish types in the Republican Party, said Bill Kristol, the editor of the Weekly Standard, who said that Netanyahu would win the Republican nomination, if he could run, because Republican primary voters are at least as hawkish as the Israeli public.  And would-be candidates responded accordingly. In a statement released after Netanyahus victory, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin congratulated the prime minister on a victory that was especially remarkable in light of the Obama administrations attempts to undermine him. Former Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida paid lip service to the two-state solution, only to argue that its pursuit should be put off. The conditions dont exist right now for that solution to truly take hold, Rubio said in an interview. Potential candidates appealing more to right-wing Jewish Republican mega donors like Sheldon Adelson or a base of conservative evangelicals, many of whom believe Israel has a biblically rooted right to the occupied territories, did not mention the two-state solution. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, for example, praised Netanyahu for defeating the full force of the Obama political team. And he happily exploited the bind in which Netanyahus rejection of the two-state solution and apparent race-baiting on the campaign trail had put Clinton. When it comes to Israel, the time for her to stand up is now, he said, adding that if Clinton disagreed with Obamas Iran nuclear negotiations, she needs to state so clearly and unequivocally right now.]", "Date": "20150319", "Title": "[U.

{"Content": "[ Washington Republicans leaders have decided to boost the stakes for next years May presidential primary by awarding the states 41 Republican National Convention delegates based on the primarys results. GOP officials made the decision to heed the results of the May 24 primary at a meeting in Pasco over the weekend, according to party spokesman Steve Beren. The move breaks with some previous election cycles in which the GOP allocated some or all delegates based on precinct caucuses, which typically draw far lower voter participation. Its also a contrast with the state Democratic Party, which intends to continue a tradition of ignoring primary results and awarding its presidential delegates based on its March 26 caucuses. Democrats have objected to the state spending $11.5 million on the primary, arguing there are better uses for that money. The states presidential primary was canceled in 2012 due to budget concerns. Democrats blocked a request by Secretary of State Kim Wyman, a Republican, to move up the date of the primary to March. Republicans had argued the primary would be more likely to draw presidential candidates to the state if it were held earlier. Republicans will still hold precinct caucuses Feb. 20 to elect precinct-level delegates, who will be winnowed down at subsequent county and state conventions. The national delegates will be bound by the primary results on a first ballot at the 2016 GOP convention, Beren said. The 2016 Republican convention, which will formally nominate the partys presidential and vice-presidential candidates, is July 18-21 in Cleveland.

{"Content": "[ Washingtons presidential primary will return in 2016, but itll remain mostly for show. The state budget enacted this month included $11.5 million to pay for the primary, which had been canceled in 2012 due to cost concerns. Some critics argue the primary should remained shelved since the political parties are free to ignore it. Despite a push by Secretary of State Kim Wyman, lawmakers did not pass a bill to make the primary more than a beauty contest by requiring the state Democratic and Republican parties to at least partially heed its results. Instead, the parties can rely on partisan caucuses to decide which presidential candidates will win Washingtons delegates. The state Democratic Party plans to do just that, continuing its tradition of selecting 100 percent of presidential-nominating delegates based on caucuses. The state Republican Party plans to award about half its delegates based on the primary and half based on caucus results. Wyman, a Republican, said shes happy the primary is back, even if it is nonbinding. I definitely think its worthwhile. You look at the history of the presidential primary  the participation is so much greater (than caucuses) even if one party doesnt use the results, she said. Wymans legislation that would have required the parties to allocate at least some delegates based on the primary passed in the Republican-controlled state Senate but stalled in the Democratic-majority House. Some Democrats argue the nonbinding vote remains a waste of taxpayer dollars. Gov. Jay Inslee didnt fund it in his budget proposal released in December. The state Democratic Party signaled early this year it had no intention of honoring the primary results. I dont know why the Legislature wants to spend $11.5 million on a process that were not using to select our delegates, said state Democratic Party Chairman Jaxon Ravens. Right now Id rather see that $11.5 million spent in other ways around the state. Ravens defended the caucus system as challenging and a bit chaotic, but said the gatherings bring neighbors together to discuss issues and serve as a organizing opportunity for the party. State Republican Party spokesman Steve Beren said the GOP is fine with using the primary results as part of its delegate-selection process. He needled Democrats for ignoring a popular democratic process entirely: maybe they should change their name. Caucuses  long weekend meetings typically attended by a relatively small slice of hard-core party activists  can be vulnerable to takeover by small but organized political factions. Washingtons primary was spurred by just such a coup in 1988, when Christian conservatives dominated the Republican caucuses to hand televangelist Pat Robertson a victory. The next year an initiative to the Legislature created the presidential primary. State Rep. Ross Hunter, D-Medina, the chief budget writer in the House, said the primary wastes money as currently constructed but said its part of the law and he had no choice but to fund it because lawmakers did not pass legislation suspending it. Hunter said he supports primaries over caucuses in general. I think selecting the most powerful person in the world should be done by the largest selection of people that we can possible have do it, he said. The date of the primary is not settled. State law calls for it to be held in late May, but Wyman is pushing for legislative leaders to agree to move it to early March to give the state more clout in the presidential race. Although Washington does not require voters to register with a party, those voting in the primary will have to declare their party preference, Democrat or Republican, and vote only in that contest. Wyman said the primary could lure more presidential contenders to campaign here  especially in the crowded Republican contest. What Im hoping for is having an early enough primary that candidates want to show well in it and visit Washington and hear the issues that are important for the Pacific Northwest  and not just use us as a cash machine, she said.]", "Date": "20150707", "Title": "[States presidential primary next year mostly for show]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/states-beauty-contest-primary-to-return-next-year/", "Author": "[Jim Brunner]"}
{"Content": "[ Waving signs and chanting count the votes, several hundred faculty members and students walked out of Seattle University on Wednesday as part of a national day of action to call attention to the working conditions of adjunct professors and instructors. Seattle University officials pushed back, saying they have already significantly increased adjunct compensation and are working on resolving other issues, including the shortage of office space. Nationwide, nontenured faculty make up the fastest-growing segment of teachers at all colleges and universities. As the economy improves, they have stepped up demands for improved job security and better pay and benefits. The issue is particularly timely at Seattle University because its adjuncts  who work on annual contracts and are not on track to earn tenure  cast their votes last summer on whether to form a union. The university appealed the election to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), arguing it should be exempt from NLRB jurisdiction because it is a religious institution.  The ballots were impounded and have never been counted. Adjuncts are awaiting a decision from the local NLRB office. A similar case involving Pacific Lutheran University was found in favor of the adjuncts. However, so many of the ballots were called into question that the adjunct faculty  known at that institution as contingents  withdrew their petition to form a union. The PLU group plans to hold another vote later this year. On Wednesday, Seattle University adjuncts  who make up more than 50 percent of the faculty  called for the administration to drop its legal action and allow the votes from the election to be counted. Those who protested say that forming a union would help improve pay and working conditions, and lead to greater job stability. And they argued that the administrations attempt to squelch union-organizing efforts runs counter to the social-justice mission of the Catholic, Jesuit-led university. I know a little about Jesuit theology and mission, and I know were not living up to it now, said Dan Peterson, an adjunct humanities instructor who specializes in theology. Peterson began teaching at Seattle University in 2009, when he was offered a full-time contract for $21,000 a year. His salary has gone up since then, but he said he still must work an extra job to make ends meet. An ordained Lutheran pastor, he preaches and teaches church classes in addition to teaching at Seattle Universitys Matteo Ricci College, an interdisciplinary humanities college. We want our vote to be heard and counted, he said. Seattle City Councilmember Kshama Sawant, who attended the rally and has worked as an adjunct at both Seattle Central College and Seattle University, said the public community college paid her better. She believes thats because the union that represents adjuncts at Seattle Central  the American Federation of Teachers  has made sure adjuncts arent shortchanged. In a statement, Seattle University officials said adjunct pay has increased significantly in just a few short years. For example, full-time contingent faculty members who three years ago made as little as $24,600 now make a minimum of $42,000 a year, and those salaries will increase to $46,000 by 2016. Larry Cushnie, an adjunct political-science instructor, said he believes a union will help adjuncts establish longer-term contracts with the university. He said hes been offered a contract a week before classes started  and he knows other adjuncts whose contracts were canceled with that little notice, too. While having a skilled workforce available at a moments notice might be good for the university, it plays havoc with professors lives, he said. Seattle University administrators say they have done a better job of offering work well in advance of the start of classes, and that full-time adjuncts are now being offered contracts in April, months before the fall quarter begins. Students also participated in Wednesdays walkout, marching around campus with their professors. Olivia Engle, a senior, said some of her best professors have been adjuncts, yet they often share cramped office spaces or must meet students off campus in coffeehouses to discuss grades and assignments. And, she said, they are paid only for the classes they teach  not for the time they spend mentoring students. It has a huge effect on our education, she said. Seattle Universitys walkout was part of a larger nationwide event, the National Adjunct Walkout Day. Along with the walkout at Seattle University, faculty members participated in informational picketing at Green River Community College, Pierce College and Seattle Colleges, according to the American Federation of Teachers. Cushnie ended the class he teaches on Wednesday early so he could participate in the walkout. Coincidentally, the class he teaches is called Activism, protest and the law. A few of his students joined him on the protest line. While Cushnie doesnt teach the adjunct movement as part of his class, I think my students see the clear connection, he said.]", "Date": "20150225", "Title": "[Nontenured instructors stage walkout over demands at SU]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/nontenured-instructors-stage-walkout-over-demands-at-su/", "Author": "[Katherine Long]"}
{"Content": "[ WERE watching the last days of a phony war in Olympia. Twice choosing to delay budget decisions, the state Legislature has deliberately pushed state agencies toward shutdown. Senate Republicans claim they are battling to save citizens from unnecessary tax increases. Surrendering on that point, House Democrats still insist the senators dont know how to count and that any new tax revenues  which will be necessary soon  need come only from a few rich people. In fact, both warring parties are looking to the 2016 elections and the next battle to control the Legislature. With conservative winds blowing nationally, our Republicans are thinking they might be able to capture the governors office and continue to weaken Frank Chopps grip on the House speakers office. Democrats count on the cyclic, pro-Democrat voting patterns of a presidential election year to recapture the Senate and resume full control. Hence the fake fight. The real goal of this slow-motion, low-energy Legislature has been the final news release. Each party knew from Day One that a last-minute deal could avoid shutting down state government. Both parties have long known that they absolutely must vote out a budget this year that (minimally) satisfies our state Supreme Courts demand for real progress on school spending. Beyond that, no need to hurry. Delay maximizes the political theater and multiplies the partisan payoff in next years elections. Months of posturing have cost all of us far more than the extra per diem paid when lawmakers gather (occasionally) in Olympia. The biggest single casualty of this political theater is our education system. Yes, each side appears to agree on a major increment in the Supreme Court-ordered McCleary spending. Both sides seem ready to join in persuading the court that they are successfully climbing the spending ramp toward the 2018 paramount goal of ample funding for the basic education of all children in the state. But the needs of our states education system go way beyond those legalistic parameters for K-12 spending. Our states future as a prosperous hub of innovation and manufacturing depends on our ability to increase immediately the numbers of successful high-school and college graduates. As Washingtons business leaders tell the Legislature over and over, they are hungry to hire. Lacking enough homegrown graduates, Washingtons marquee businesses are importing great numbers of high-skill professionals from elsewhere. And elsewhere is where our businesses are going to move unless we can rapidly ramp up our graduation numbers. The requirement is plain: We need to educate a lot of people. We will need many more ready-to-hire citizens in the years ahead. These days, to be ready to work requires almost everyone to earn a certificate or degree beyond high school. Most will have to return to the classroom every few years for updating. How to do that? First, lose fewer of the students already in school. Educators are attacking the dropout problem. But dropouts continue to leak in huge numbers from our underfunded high schools and colleges  especially among students from low-income, first-generation families without college-educated parents to show the way. Second, bring many more of our under- and unemployed young adults into our apprentice programs, colleges and universities. The fact is that our state has no economic future unless our Latino, African-American and other minority communities are fully and successfully part of our mainstream education system. But that is not the education system the backroom dealmakers are cobbling together this week in Olympia. Instead of strategic leadership, were getting political posturing and the budget shaving that automatically goes with pandering. Even if they somehow manage to satisfy the court on basic funding, our legislators will leave our overall education system too small, our teacher corps in crisis and way too many of our citizens fenced out. This was a missed opportunity. There are many fine legislators and some excellent leaders in each caucus in Olympia. Party bosses could have been leading the states voters to understand what our business leaders and our working families already know: Education works  lets have more.]", "Date": "20150624", "Title": "[Phony politicking in Olympia puts education at risk]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/phony-politicking-in-olympia-puts-education-at-risk/", "Author": "[Larry Seaquist]"}

{"Content": "[ White people will no longer make up a majority of Americans by 2043, according to new census projections. Thats part of a historic shift that already is reshaping the nations schools, workforce and electorate, and is redefining long-held notions of race. The official projection, released Wednesday by the Census Bureau, now places the tipping point for the white majority a year later than previous estimates, which were made before the impact of the recent economic downturn was fully known. America continues to grow and become more diverse due to higher birth rates among minorities, particularly for Hispanics who entered the U.S. at the height of the immigration boom in the 1990s and early 2000s. Since the mid-2000 housing bust, however, the arrival of millions of new immigrants from Mexico and other nations has slowed from its once-torrid pace. The countrys changing demographic mosaic has stark political implications, shown clearly in last months election that gave President Barack Obama a second term  in no small part due to his support from 78 percent of non-white voters. There are social and economic ramifications, as well. Longstanding fights over civil rights and racial equality are going in new directions, promising to reshape race relations and common notions of being a minority. White plaintiffs now before the Supreme Court argue that special protections for racial and ethnic minorities dating back to the 1960s may no longer be needed, from affirmative action in college admissions to the Voting Rights Act, designed for states with a history of disenfranchising blacks. Residential segregation has eased and intermarriage for first- and second-generation Hispanics and Asians is on the rise, blurring racial and ethnic lines and lifting the numbers of people who identify as multiracial. Unpublished 2010 census data show that millions of people shunned standard race categories such as black or white on government forms, opting to write in their own cultural or individual identities. By 2060, multiracial people are projected to more than triple, from 7.5 million to 26.7 million  rising even faster and rendering notions of race labels increasingly irrelevant, experts say, if lingering stigma over being mixed-race can fully fade. The non-Hispanic white population, now at 197.8 million, is projected to peak at 200 million in 2024, before entering a steady decline in absolute numbers as the massive baby boomer generation enters its golden years. Four years after that, racial and ethnic minorities will become a majority among adults 18-29 and wield an even greater impact on the youth vote in presidential elections, census projects. The fast-growing demographic today is now the children of immigrants, said Marcelo Suarez-Orozco, a global expert on immigration and dean of UCLAs Graduate School of Education & Information Studies, describing the rate of minority growth in the U.S. as dipping from overdrive to drive. Even with slowing immigration, Suarez-Orozco says, the die has been cast for strong minority growth from births. As recently as 1960, whites made up 85 percent of the U.S. but that share has steadily dropped after a 1965 overhaul of U.S. immigration laws opened doors to waves of new immigrants from Mexico, Latin America and Asia. By 2000, the percentage of U.S. whites had slid to 69 percent; it now stands at nearly 64 percent. Moving forward, the U.S. will become the first major post-industrial society in the world where minorities will be the majority, Suarez-Orozco said. With the white baby boomer population now leaving the workforce, the big challenge will be educating the new immigrants, he said. The U.S. has nearly 315 million people today. According to the projections released Wednesday, the U.S. population is projected to cross the 400 million mark in 2051, 12 years later than previously projected. The population will hit 420.3 million a half century from now in 2060. By then, whites will drop to 43 percent of the U.S. Blacks will make up 14.7 percent, up slightly from today. Hispanics, currently 17 percent of the population, will more than double in absolute number, making up 31 percent, or nearly 1 in 3 residents, according to the projections. Asians are expected to increase from 5 percent of the population to 8 percent. Among children, the point when minorities become the majority is expected to arrive much sooner, by 2018 or so. Last year, racial and ethnic minorities became a majority among babies under age 1 for the first time in U.S. history. At the same time, the U.S. population as a whole is aging, driven by 78 million mostly white baby boomers born between 1946 and 1964. By 2030, roughly 1 in 5 residents will be 65 and older. Over the next half century, the oldest old  those ages 85 and older  will more than triple to 18.2 million, reaching 4 percent of the U.S. population. The actual shift in demographics will be shaped by a host of factors that cant always be accurately pinpointed  the pace of the economic recovery, cultural changes, natural or manmade disasters, as well as an overhaul of immigration law, which is expected to be debated in Congress early next year. The next half century marks key points in continuing trends  the U.S. will become a plurality nation, where the non-Hispanic white population remains the largest single group, but no group is in the majority, said acting Census Bureau Director Thomas Mesenbourg. Republicans have been seeking to broaden their appeal to minorities, who made up 28 percent of the electorate this year, after faring poorly among non-whites on Election Day, when Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney carried only about 20 percent of non-white votes. The race and ethnic changes are already seen in pockets of the U.S. and in the younger age groups, where roughly 45 percent of all students in K-12 are Hispanics, blacks, Asian-Americans and others. Already, the District of Columbia and four states  Hawaii, California, New Mexico and Texas  have minority populations greater than 50 percent; across the U.S. more than 11 percent of counties have tipped to majority-minority status. Last month, nearly all voters over age 65 were white (87 percent), but among voters under age 30, just 58 percent were white. Irrespective of future immigration and minority fertility patterns, the U.S. is facing a stagnating white population, said William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. The biggest shift will occur over the next 20 years as the mostly white baby boom generation moves into traditional retirement years. It is in the child and early labor force ages where we must be ready for the greatest changes as new American minorities take over for aging whites. Economically, the rapidly growing non-white population gives the U.S. an advantage over other developed nations, including Russia, Japan and France, which are seeing reduced growth or population losses due to declining birth rates and limited immigration. The combined population of more-developed countries other than the U.S. has been projected to decline beginning in 2016, raising the prospect of prolonged budget crises as the number of working-age citizens diminish, pension costs rise and tax revenues fall. Depending on future rates of immigration, the U.S. population is estimated to continue growing through at least 2060. In a hypothetical situation in which all immigration  both legal and illegal  immediately stopped, previous government estimates have suggested the U.S. could lose population beginning in 2048. Young families  many of them first or second-generation immigrants  have been the engine of U.S. population growth for several decades, said Mark Mather, associate vice president of the Population Reference Bureau. , AP Director of Polling Jennifer Agiesta contributed to this report.]", "Date": "20121212", "Title": "[Census: Whites no longer a majority in US by 2043]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/census-whites-no-longer-a-majority-in-us-by-2043/", "Author": "[HOPE YEN]"}
{"Content": "[ Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker brought his fiery brand of Republican politics to Seattle on Thursday night, describing at a think-tank fundraiser how he believes conservatives can reclaim our country. With some 300 demonstrators outside the downtown Sheraton Seattle Hotel protesting his appearance, the controversial and high-profile governor joked to the dinners 2,000 attendees that he felt quite at home. His half-hour speech urged Republicans to speak more optimistically about their ideas, talk in terms that are more relevant to voters and have the courage to act boldly. Im optimistic about the future of this great country, said Walker, who is up for re-election next year and is considered a potential 2016 presidential candidate. The governor came to town to pick up an award from the Washington Policy Center at the conservative-leaning think tanks 16th annual dinner, which also featured prominent Johns Hopkins University neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Carson, who gained a national profile after a video of his speech at this years National Prayer Breakfast went viral, on Thursday delivered a longer talk that wended through many theoretical issues. Carson warned of the secular progressive movement trying to erase all traces of God from our society and called for Americans to come together. We the people are the boss, he said. Organizers described the dinner as the Washington Policy Centers largest-ever annual event, with overflow rooms down the hall and in Spokane. The fundraiser did not yield any money for Walker or Carson, only for the think tank. Still, the cross-country invitation of Walker enraged local unions and liberal activists. The 45-year-old governor is best-known for his 2011 proposal, weeks after taking office, to curtail state workers collective-bargaining rights and prevent government unions from automatically deducting dues from members paychecks. The bill triggered weeks of protests and led Democratic lawmakers to leave the state, but eventually won approval. Walker survived a recall election last year. On Thursday, protesters gathered on Sixth Avenue two hours before the dinners start carrying signs that read, Stop The Attack On Worker Rights and Washington Respects Working Families. King County Executive Dow Constantine, Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn and his rival in the upcoming mayoral election, state Sen. Ed Murray, delivered speeches highlighting the success of liberal policies. Like Gov. Walker, I took office during tough times, Constantine said. But I partnered with our workers. Pat Miller of the Pacific Northwest Regional Council of Carpenters said he had a simpler message for the governor: Go away. The point of the protest, said organizer David Freiboth, was to affirm to the community that Seattle is a progressive city. Were here to say, Have your fun, said Freiboth, executive secretary of the King County Labor Council. We (progressives) are still going to run the agenda here. But at the dinner, speakers painted the protest as the result of bitterness over Walkers success. Former U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton, in introducing Walker, told the crowd that picketing you ran into on the way in tonight, is the reaction of losers. Walkers speech was largely devoid of zingers like that. Instead, he focused on his successes in office. Walker said that during his tenure as governor, Wisconsins unemployment has fallen dramatically, its budget deficit has turned into a surplus and many more of its employers feel the state is moving in the right direction, The reality is more mixed, as Wisconsins unemployment rate hasnt fallen as fast as the rest of the country and recent news reports have shown that it is unlikely Walker will fulfill his promise to deliver 250,000 jobs in his first term.

{"Content": "[ With a debate performance that was steely, self-assured and, at times, personal, Carly Fiorina appears to have improved her standing in the race to be the Republican nominee. But even if she ultimately falls short, she took a big stride toward filling a role her party needs: A powerful and credible antidote to the gender gap and the Democrats claims of a Republican war on women. The question, as many Republicans see it, is whether they can seize on the opening. A series of coming events threatens to feed into efforts by the Democrats to paint the Republican Party as tone-deaf on womens issues. Republicans in Congress are threatening a government shutdown in a dispute over funding Planned Parenthood. The governments spending authority expires in less than two weeks, and many conservatives have threatened to vote against a new budget if it includes any money for the organization. In a separate move, Senate Republicans are moving quickly to schedule a vote on legislation that would impose a federal ban on abortion at 20 weeks of pregnancy. It would be the most restrictive abortion bill to reach the Senate floor in a decade. Similar laws across the country are facing legal challenges from womens groups that argue they are unconstitutional. But with Hillary Rodham Clintons popularity falling among women as questions about her honesty and integrity continue to follow her, many Republicans are beginning to see Fiorina as someone who, if she is not the presidential nominee, is a much more serious contender for the vice-presidential nomination or a large leadership role within the party. If shes not on the ticket, they would be foolish not to offer her a key role in the next administration, said Penny Nance, president of Concerned Women for America, a conservative organization. The Republican Party, she said, has begun to correct its past mistakes of neglecting its female talent. I think theyre learning their lesson. At the debate at the Reagan library Wednesday, Fiorina spoke directly to the women watching in a way that none of the 10 men with her on stage could. Describing how she lost her stepdaughter to drug abuse, she revealed a painful episode that many people watching were unaware of: My husband, Frank, and I buried a child to drug addiction. She said she knew how disgusted women must have felt when Trump said  and then later denied saying  that she was too ugly to be president. I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said, she responded. And as some of the men struggled to name a woman who wasnt an immediate family member to put on the $10 bill, Fiorina dismissed the whole exercise as empty symbolism. I think, honestly, its a gesture. I dont think it helps to change our history, she said. We ought to recognize that women are not a special-interest group. Her answer on the $10 bill question, said Kristen Soltis Anderson, a Republican pollster and author, was instructive in how it revealed Fiorinas discomfort with being seen as someone trying to capitalize on her gender. She resists that, Anderson said, noting that her research has shown younger women do not find it as important to vote for the first female president as older women do. The largest gender gap was recorded in the 2012 presidential election: 20 percentage points, according to Gallup. Mitt Romney won among men by 8 percentage points while President Obama won women by 12 percentage points overall. But among white women, Obama lost, with 42 percent to Romneys 56 percent. To win the White House in 2016, Republicans would almost certainly need to win more than 56 percent of the white female vote. Many see Fiorina as a way to help them do that, either as the nominee or in some other role. Many Republicans will see her, even if shes not the nominee, as that magic key that can unlock the gender gap, said Bruce Haynes, president of Purple Strategies, a Republican consulting firm. Thats a challenge that many have feared has been set in concrete over time. Building a credible campaign, Haynes added, is far more difficult than having a strong debate performance. And keeping that credibility intact could get much harder in a government shutdown. You dont control the agenda, and you have to react to the agenda of others  such as congressional Republicans who want to back everybody up against a wall as usual, he said. For her part, Fiorina is siding with the hard-liners in her party who want to see a veto showdown with Obama, who has said he will reject any attempt to take away Planned Parenthoods funding. This is about the character of our nation, she said at the debate, receiving some of the most vigorous applause of the night. And if we will not stand up and force President Obama to veto this bill, shame on us. Democrats said voters should not be confused about what Fiorina is really saying. You do that and the government shuts down. Plain and simple, said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. She is indistinguishable, other than her gender, from her counterparts on that stage. Democrats also exposed a flaw in Fiorinas debate comments about the undercover videos of Planned Parenthood that have led to the calls to eliminate its funding. She dared the president and Clinton to watch the tapes, saying, Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain. The video that Fiorina seems to be referring to does show a still image of a fetus being held outside the womb. But it is not seen squirming as Fiorina describes, nor is there any indication that it is about to have its brain removed. With her social and fiscal conservatism, Fiorina would seem to be a good fit for a Republican nominating contest. A general election, however, is something some Democrats said they would welcome.

The details behind the Seahawks Failed Percy Harvin Experiment of 2014  which ranks right up there with similarly monumental historic events such as the Great Seattle Fire of 1889 and the Great Charlie Chong West Seattle Snow Plow Revolt of 1995  finally can be known. The former Seahawks receiver, for whom the team shelled out $19 million for 27 receptions, revealed this week to the crack Tiger Beat news team on ESPN / TMZ that he simply never felt accepted by Seattles other receivers. Heartbreaking, really. Harvin said he got little love from the other boys even after he told them: Hey, guys, Im here to ball with you, to take us to the next level. One can only imagine the trauma associated with being inserted into a peer group of obscenely compensated Alpha males who unanimously refuse an open invitation to ball with you. Especially when the same guys were whispering things to local media that Harvin was rubbed wrong by. Who among us wouldnt feel the need to wail on some of them?, Yet another hapless victim of the Seattle Freeze.

{"Content": "[ Workers who make minimum wage are a meager 1.5 percent slice of the local job market, but their numbers nearly doubled over the past two years. Among them is Dallas Brazier, who struggles to get by on $9.19 an hour despite carefully managing his expenses. He lives with an aunt in Tacoma and takes the bus to his job at Burger King in South Seattle. Brazier, 28, also is part of a growing movement to raise the minimum wage to $15 in Seattle. Im marching to help improve workers rights and create equal opportunity, Brazier said during a 13-mile protest march from SeaTac to Seattle City Hall, one of a series of rallies nationwide calling for a $15 living wage. I feel I deserve to be paid more because I go above and beyond, and I like my work. Even so, a $15 wage floor would cover way more than the 14,400 jobs in King County that pay only the current minimum. Statewide, about a quarter of workers in October earned less than $15 an hour, or $31,200 a year on a full-time basis. A lot of the extremes of the economy are settled in Seattle. We have a robust tech sector. But we also have a lot of restaurants, bars, hotels and retail, not to mention home and health-care workers, said Marilyn Watkins, policy director at the Seattle-based Economic Opportunity Institute. Those are all people who are going to be below that $15-an-hour range. Seattle now finds itself at the forefront of a national push by labor leaders to boost the minimum wage to a more livable level and ease poverty. Bolstered by a supportive new mayor and a socialist City Council member, activistsaim to bring Seattle in line with SeaTac, where voters last month narrowly approved a $15 minimum wage for airport-related workers. Were carrying the $15 victory from SeaTac to the destination of our next victory, said Working Washington spokesman and march organizer Sage Wilson.  ,  National restaurant-industry leaders    lambasted the pay-raise efforts as harmful to workers and the economy, but critics locally chose a muted response to the idea of a $15 minimum wage. Rather than getting our backs up, we want to approach this from the angle of looking forward to working with city leaders and trying to find a solution that works, said Anthony Anton, president of the Washington Restaurant Association, which opposed SeaTacs $15-an-hour ballot measure. What we dont want to do is draw a line so early that we cant have a conversation. Washingtons minimum wage of $9.19 is the highest of any state in the nation and will rise to $9.32 on Jan. 1 due to an inflation adjustment. A national economic recovery heavily skewed toward low-paying jobs has fueled fears that the middle class is shrinking and has brought new attention to the income gap between rich and poor. Theres a middle class thats shaken by the crisis and feels insecure, said Michael Reich, director of the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California, Berkeley. Somebody who lost their job making, say, $60,000 or $70,000 a year maybe now makes $30,000 or $40,000. The next step below that is minimum wage. Nationwide, nearly 40 percent of jobs last year paid less than $15 an hour, up 3 percentage points from 2009, according to the Seattle-based Alliance for a Just Society, a national network of grass-roots community organizations.  In King County, full-time jobs that pay within 2 percent of minimum wage  or less than $9.38  represented 1.5 percent of the work force in 2012, up from 1.2 percent in 2011, state Employment Security Department data show. Employers countywide added the equivalent of 6,750 full-time minimum-wage jobs from 2010 to 2012, an 88 percent increase. Early in the recovery, we saw a lot of job growth in manufacturing, particularly aerospace, as well as professional and business services, said Anneliese Vance-Sherman, a regional labor economist at the Employment Security Department. But then the momentum shifted to sectors with a lot of low-wage jobs, and that would explain the jump. Its not known how many workers in Seattle would be directly affected by a   minimum- wage increase to $15. Detailed pay information by city or county, beyond the minimum wage, is scant. And while the Seattle City Council has set aside $100,000 to study a $15 wage, that wont be done until June. Mayor-elect Ed Murray, who will lead the study, has promised to bring organized labor and business groups to the bargaining table. He also has said he supports a phased-in approach, starting with city workers and then extending it to employees of national retail and fast-food companies. Likewise, a majority of city council members say they support a $15 minimum wage, but they point to the potential for a lengthy ramp-up to give employers time to adjust, or exemptions for small businesses. Others call for a greater sense of urgency. Socialist Kshama Sawant, who campaigned on a $15 minimum wage in her successful bid for a council seat, vows to put it to a public vote with a 2014 ballot initiative if the process drags on. Its really quite astonishing how much momentum this movement has gathered within the past year, said Ben Henry, a senior policy associate at the Alliance for a Just Society. This is the first time we might actually get a minimum wage that at least comes close to what it takes to live.  President Obama and congressional Democrats are pushing federal legislation that would gradually raise the U.S. minimum wage to $10.10 from $7.25 and peg it to inflation. But the bill faces an uphill battle in the Republican-led House of Representatives. Meanwhile, some states and cities are taking matters into their own hands. The Washington, D.C. City Council last week approved an increase in the minimum wage to $11.50 an hour from $8.25 by 2016. Last month, New Jersey voters passed a statewide minimum standard of $8.25. And in September, California lawmakers committed to raising the states wage floor to $10 from $8 by 2016.  The Alliance for a Just Society estimates that working full-time at minimum wage in Washington state provides just   57 percent of what a single adult needs and only a third of what a parent of two children needs to get by. Labor activists also argue that a $15 minimum wage would reduce costs for public-welfare programs, such as food stamps and Medicaid, while stimulating consumer spending and boosting the economy.  Michael Reich, the UC-Berkeley economics professor, said he has studied San Franciscos decade-old minimum-wage ordinance and found that businesses benefited from lower staff turnover and higher productivity. He noted that small businesses were given two years to adjust to the new law. The California minimum wage was $6.75 in 2004 when San Francisco set its own standard of $8.50, plus annual inflation adjustments. The citys minimum wage will increase next month by 19 cents to $10.74  well below the $15 talked about in Seattle. Based on San Franciscos experience, it has all worked out well, Reich said. Even in a low-wage industry like restaurants, employment has grown faster in San Francisco than in surrounding counties., But opponents say a $15 minimum would drive up the costs of doing business in Seattle, causing significant job losses and price increases. They also argue that businesses already are on the hook for a range of new regulations, from the U.S. Affordable Care Act to the 2011 Seattle paid-sick-leave ordinance. Whats more, workers accustomed to making several dollars more than minimum wage might not be content to go to only $15 along with everyone else. Weve had some fairly lackluster economic growth for a while. Folks can be frustrated with that. But Id caution against a knee-jerk reaction to force businesses to pay people more because that comes with unintended consequences, said Maxford Nelson, a labor-policy analyst at the Freedom Foundation in Olympia. Our solutions need to be more about fixing the economy and getting things running again, he said. That will improve wages and opportunities for folks. Meanwhile, some minimum-wage workers say $15 would mean financial freedom. Martina Phelps, 21, who participated in Thursdays protest march with her 5-year-old niece, Emonie, said its hard making ends meet on the $9.25 an hour she earnsat McDonalds on Capitol Hill. She smiled at the prospect of a $5.75-an-hour pay raise. I could go back to school, pay for my medication  I just found out Im diabetic  and live by myself, she said. Others hope the $15 movement spreads beyond Seattle. Karl Balogh, 28, makes $10.75 at McDonalds in Gig Harbor and $9.19 at Arbys in Tacoma. All told, he works 60 to 70 hours a week to make ends meet. This is just the next step, Balogh said of the push for $15 in Seattle. From there, well take it to wherever we can, hopefully Tacoma. Amy Martinez: 206-464-2923 or amartinez@seattletimes.com.

{"Content": "[ LIMA, Peru  President Ollanta Humala, in an effort to avoid controversy, has kept public appearances to a minimum during his first two months in office. Other members of his highly eccentric family, however, do not share the presidents low-key style. His father, Isaac Humala, is the outspoken founder of ethnocacerism, which argues that Andean natives like him and his children are superior to descendants of the whites who colonized Peru and still dominate its politics and economy. Natives, he asserts, should run the country. Brother Antauro Humala is serving a 19-year prison sentence for leading an attempt to overthrow the government in 2005, when an attack on a police post in the highlands city of Andahuaylas claimed the lives of four police officers and two attackers. He laments that the president abandoned the militant socialist ideals they once shared in order to get elected. The government is every day more beholden to the right, he said. Plenty of world leaders have relatives who embarrass them, but few extended first families compare with the Humalas. Other relatives creating discomfort for the president include Ollantas oldest brother, Ulisses, who urged people ahead of the election not to vote for Ollanta, saying hed be disastrous for the country. And younger brother Alexis traveled to Russia just before inauguration day July 28 to talk to heavyweights in that countrys fishing and natural-gas industries. The president-elect said the trip took him completely by surprise, and it still hasnt been explained. Ever since Ollanta Humala appeared on the political scene in Peru, he has had this kind of shadow of familial accompaniment, political analyst Nelson Manrique said. The Humala familys peculiarities played prominently in the 2006 presidential race, when his parents described homosexuals as immoral and spooked Perus upper class with talk of a class war. Humala narrowly lost to Alan Garcia in a runoff. Humalas relations largely stayed out of the public eye during the latest campaign. But after the election, brother Antauro gave of jailhouse interviews in which he insulted leading members of his brothers government. He called Prime Minister Salomon Lerner, of Jewish origin, a foreigner, and suggested Lerner was really running the government. Antauro Humala also called the president of Congress inept. Meanwhile, the presidents father, Isaac, said: Im sorry that the presidents advisers and ministers are sabotaging him. Lerners response: It must be painful for the president, more than an annoyance, to have this kind of disquiet in his family. Ollanta and Antauro Humala became public figures in 2000 when they declared disobedience to then-President Alberto Fujimori as his government was collapsing and marched in a bloodless mutiny into the mountains from their base in Locumba. Their relationship changed five years after the bloody Andahuaylas revolt, which Antauro claims had his brothers full backing. He said Ollanta hasnt visited him since he was imprisoned. But that hasnt stopped the 48-year-old former army major from taking partial credit for his brothers victory. It would have been impossible for Ollanta Humala to rise to power if we hadnt rebelled in Locumba and if we didnt rebel in Andahuaylas, he said. It was a necessary sacrifice. The president, 49, clearly is uncomfortable with such statements. I love my brother but dont share his ideas, he told CNN last month. Isaac Humala, who fathered seven children in his marriage to Elena Tasso and three outside it, sought to instill in all his offspring his doctrine of ethnocacerism, which asserts the superiority of the copper-hued race that descends from the Incas. He made his children read leftist thinkers such as Jose Carlos Mariategui and the poet Cesar Vallejo, turning dinner-table discussions into colloquia. The 81-year-old lawyer reared them for greatness, particularly the brothers who figured third and fourth in birth order and whom he persuaded to opt for military careers. A few years ago, he described for a TV interviewer his ambitions for the two sons who would become soldiers. A military career is a direct route to power, he said, because with 60 armed men you can seize the [presidential] palace. Ollanta Humala would rise to lieutenant colonel and military attach in South Korea before being retired, just before the Andahuaylas uprising, over his perceived disloyalty to then-President Alejandro Toledo. In Isaac Humalas eyes, Andahuaylas made his son Antauro a hero. The role that Antauro plays in a society of tragedy is of martyrology, he said. Isaac Humala acted as his sons lawyer in a bid to overturn the murder conviction. The Supreme Court last month reduced the sentence from 25 years to 19 years but rejected a request for a retrial on reduced charges of sedition. Antauro claims he never fired a shot. Although he receives spotty reviews from family members, President Humala wins high marks from the public for his low-key, no-nonsense approach to governing. He enjoys a 65 percent approval rating among Peruvians, according to a September Ipsos Apoyo poll. Peruvians are pleased he is making good on promises to create programs that benefit the poor without abandoning free-market-friendly policies. A whopping 88 percent of respondents said the president should not pardon his brother Antauro. But that doesnt seem to deter Antauro, who says his Ethnocacerist Party will field a candidate in 2016 presidential elections, when Ollanta Humala is constitutionally barred from running for re-election. In addition to having native Andeans run the government, the party platform argues for putting people convicted of corruption before firing squads. Ollanta Humala may be in the presidency but hes less free than I who am imprisoned, he said. In a way, in prison I am freer than Ollanta in the government palace.
