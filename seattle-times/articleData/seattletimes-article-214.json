{"Content": "[There were few changes Wednesday to the primary results for the two Port of Seattle Commission races. Marine environmental consultant Fred Felleman remains in the lead for Bill Bryants open Position 5 seat, bringing in almost 23 percent of the votes, up from 22 percent Tuesday. Marion Yoshino, a former Normandy Park City Council member, has almost 19 percent, while perennial candidate Richard Pope stayed a close third with 16 percent. The top two vote-getters will move on to the November general election. Former airline pilot Ken Rogers and former Clipper Navigation CEO Darrell Bryan, who led the field in fundraising with $103,000 in contributions, remained roughly unchanged, with 12 and 11 percent, respectively. Both Felleman and Yoshino have been critical of the lack of transparency behind the Ports lease with Foss Maritime to host Shells Arctic drilling fleet and ran on environmental platforms. Felleman spoke of environmental leadership and Yoshino of a clean environment. Our communities, families and environment can no longer afford a business-as-usual approach to Port operations  from the lack of public engagement, transparency, or sufficient consideration of the environment in their decision-making  and that is why I ran for Port Commissioner, Felleman said in a statement Tuesday night. In the fight between perennial candidates Goodspaceguy and John Naubert to take on incumbent Courtney Gregoire for Position 2, Goodspaceguy remains in the lead with 9 percent, with Naubert close behind at 8 percent.]", "Date": "20150805", "Title": "[Port of Seattle race remains close]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/port-of-seattle-race-remains-close/", "Author": "[Coral Garnick]"}
