{"Content": "[WASHINGTON (AP)  Senate historian Donald Ritchie is stepping down from his front-row seat to the best show in town. That is the tradition, scandal and scholarly debate of the United States Senate, which Ritchie has observed and written about for all four decades the Historical Office has existed. Hes the guy you see on TV you see explaining the historic significance of events like swearing-in ceremonies and inaugurations, said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. in bidding Ritchie farewell. I dont think any of us would want to face him on Jeopardy., Consulted by reporters, senators, staff and luminaries alike, Ritchie has authored more than a dozen books, including three textbooks, said Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. Author Dan Brown contacted Ritchie for his best-seller, The Da Vinci Code, and biographer Robert Caro did likewise for his voluminous writing about President Lyndon Johnson. Any person needing valuable insight into the United States Senate and its history has known where to go, Reid said. Ritchie, 69, watched from a corner seat just behind the senators. He has held the post since 2009, when he succeeded founding Senate Historian Richard Baker. Baker hired Ritchie when the office first opened in the mid-1970s. Historians never retire, Don says, McConnell added. They just have more time to research.
