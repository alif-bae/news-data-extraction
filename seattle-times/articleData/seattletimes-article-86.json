{"Content": "[WASHINGTON  Social media erupted Thursday when a microphone at a routine Senate Appropriations Committee meeting caught Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk joking that colleague Lindsey Graham was a bro with no ho. The reference by Kirk, a Republican, was to the unmarried Grahams observation that if elected president, hed have rotating first ladies. The South Carolina Republican senator recently said he was seeking the Republican nomination for president. On an audio of the exchange with an unknown colleague, while other senators were voting Thursday, Kirk can be heard saying: Ive been joking with Lindsey. Did you see that? Hes going to have a rotating first lady. Hes a bro with no ho. Kirks spokeswoman, Danielle Varallo, said the remark was just a joke between two friends. Social-media sites soon opined and linked to it. Huffington Post posted the audio. Politico and other post-a-minute sites jumped on it, too. Kirk, who faces a tough re-election in 2016, is no stranger to oral kerfuffles. This spring, he was criticized for saying black neighborhoods of Illinois are the ones we drive faster through. He was trying to explain the need for economic development and touting his ideas for that and his anti-gang policies to help poor neighborhoods, but some criticized the remarks as racially insensitive. Earlier, he sparked commentary when he had compared the abortion debate to slavery. Dan Pfeiffer, former senior communications adviser for President Obama, noted the online buzz over the comments and tweeted: Checked three times to make sure this wasnt an @TheOnion headline.
