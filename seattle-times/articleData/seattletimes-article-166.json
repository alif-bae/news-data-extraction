Paul is following in the footsteps of his father, former Texas congressman Ron Paul, who twice ran for president  and who stirred a lively volunteer presence in Washington state. He placed second in Washingtons 2012 GOP caucuses. Pauls visit is the latest in a string of presidential candidate forays to the Seattle area.
