{"Content": "[ Hillary Clinton is in a difficult predicament [Bush stumbles while Hillary hides, Opinion, May 18]. Since announcing her candidacy for president, she has avoided all situations in which reporters or voters could ask her questions. They cannot ask her why she commingled her private and official emails on her own private server while she was secretary of state. They cannot ask her why she erased the emails she considered to be private instead of allowing that determination to be made by others. They cannot ask her why she doesnt make the server available to congressional committees that have requested it. They cannot ask her about contributions made to the Clinton Foundation by foreign interests while she was secretary of state. Apparently, the answers would be damaging to her candidacy. She has a right to avoid answering any and all questions, but would we really want to elect a president who refused to answer questions that related to her fitness for office? I want to vote for the person who willingly answers questions relating to his or her honesty and integrity. Carroll E.
