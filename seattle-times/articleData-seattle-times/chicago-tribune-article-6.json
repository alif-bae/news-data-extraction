{"Content": "[ After days of rumors that he might make a bid for the White House, Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz declared Thursday that hell stick with the coffee business. But that doesnt mean he doesnt have a few ideas on how to run the country. In a New York Times op-ed published Thursday, Schultz wrote that, Despite the encouragement of others, I have no intention of entering the presidential fray. Im not done serving at Starbucks. He criticized aspirants to the nomination for being unable to rise above petty politics. Our country deserves a candidate courageous enough to select a member of the other party as a running mate, he wrote. Our country deserves a president humble enough to see leadership not as an entitlement but as a privilege. Speculation about Schultz jumping into the race surfaces occasionally, in part because the Democratic-leaning executive is vocal about social and policy issues. But rumors took a more urgent tone this week after New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote that powerful friends of the coffee titan were encouraging him to run. Schultz said theres plenty people can do to solve Americas problems from outside the White House: The values of servant leadership  putting others first and leading from the heart  need to emerge from every corner of American life, including the business community. ]", "Date": "20150806", "Author": "[gel Gonzlez]", "Link": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/howard-schultz-no-intention-to-run-for-president/", "Title": "[Howard Schultz: No intention to run for president]"}
