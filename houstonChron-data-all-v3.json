{"Content": "[ A man, as Clint Eastwoods Dirty Harry Callahan put it, has got to know his limitations. As a fellow at his half-century mark, I have long since digested mine. For me, there will be no speeches elevating the throngs, no judicial opinions shaping the law. Like most of us, there will primarily be observation. , But my, what a time to observe. , Getting ready for next weeks inauguration, it seemed appropriate to read the president-elects The Audacity of Hope. Though I had sworn off self-serving books by contemporary politicians some time ago, I was genuinely hoping that this one would be different. It was. , Because I teach a constitutional law course, as Obama once did, I was especially drawn to the chapter, Our Constitution. Though constitutional jurisprudence is but one of several topics covered, the tone was instructive. What I found was not a simplistic, one-size-fits-all approach such as that employed by many of his political opponents; that is, the familiar, We need judges that strictly interpret the Constitution as the Framers wrote it. For them, that refrain constitutes game, set and match. , If only it were that simple. , The president-elect understands that the law, just like this nations history, is anything but simple. He acknowledges the thorny realities, those which complicate: That accurately ascertaining what this nations founders intended by the document they patched together 222 years ago is a quest more chimerical than real; and that those very framers housed contradictions as deep as any men. And on the precipice of Obamas assumption of the enormous mess that will officially be his next Tuesday, the fact that he would rather proceed down the more difficult winding road strikes me as reason for optimism. , Regarding the enticing illusion of divining the original intent of those responsible for the Constitution, the president-elect noted: Anyone looking to resolve our modern constitutional dispute through strict construction has one more problem: The Founders and ratifiers themselves disagreed profoundly, vehemently, on the meaning of their masterpiece. Before the ink on the constitutional parchment was dry, arguments had erupted, not just about minor provisions but about the first principle, not just between peripheral figures but within the Revolutions very core. They argued about how much power the national government should have  to regulate the economy, to supersede state laws, to form a standing army, or to assume debt. They argued about the presidents role in establishing treaties with foreign powers, and about the Supreme Courts role in determining the law. They argued about the meaning of such basic rights as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, and on several occasions, when the fragile state seemed threatened, they were not averse to ignoring those rights altogether. Given what we know of this scrum, with all its shifting alliances and occasionally underhanded tactics, it is unrealistic to believe that a judge, two hundred years later, can somehow discern the original intent of the Founders or ratifiers. , As to the complexity of the founders themselves (and while a recent inductee to the Senate), Obama wrote: Listening to Senator [Robert] Byrd speak, I felt with full force all the essential contradictions of me in this new place, with its marble busts, its arcane traditions, it memories and its ghosts. I pondered the fact that, according to his own autobiography, Senator Byrd had received his first taste of leadership in his early twenties, as a member of the Raleigh County Ku Klux Klan.  I wondered if it should matter. Senator Byrds life  like most of ours  has been the struggle of warring impulses, a twining of darkness and light. And in that sense I realized that he really was a proper emblem for the Senate, whose rules and design reflect the grand compromise of Americas founding: the bargain between Northern states and Southern states, the Senates role as a guardian against the passions of the moment, a defender of minority rights and state sovereignty, but also a tool to protect the wealthy from the rabble, and assure slaveholders of noninterference with their peculiar institution. Stamped into the very fiber of the Senate, within its genetic code, was the same contest between power and principle that characterized America as a whole, a lasting expression of that great debate among a few brilliant, flawed men that had concluded with the creation of a form of government unique in its genius  yet blind to the whip and the chain. , No matter ones views on constitutional interpretation, no matter what one thinks of this man, one cannot in good faith deem such reflections expedient sound bites or equate them with the animated chatter that has sadly come to pass for reasoned debate. Ruminations such as these cannot be squeezed onto a bumper sticker and would be most ineffective during a Fox or MSNBC shout-off. They are the serious thoughts of a serious man on a serious topic. And when one reads the president-elects entire book  composed without the obligatory ghostwriter  one sees the same level of humble intellectualism and mental wrestling again and again and again. In these terribly complex times when we all have so much to lose, it inspires  I dare say  hope. , Obviously, none of us knows how things will turn out for our next president. He may be an utter failure; he may be the next FDR. But either way, it is heartening to have a leader capable of seeing nuance where nuance exists, capable of demonstrating the strength of mind to acknowledge both this nations great promise as well as its many frailties. For if recent history teaches us anything, it is not that our best leaders necessarily have all the answers in advance, but that they have the capacity to ask the hard questions, listen soberly and then move forward with humility. , Political leaders, too, need to know their limitations.

{"Content": "[ Advocating the adoption of the new Constitution drafted in Philadelphia, the authors of \"The Federalist Papers\" mocked the \"imbecility\" of the weak central government created a dozen years earlier by the Articles of Confederation. But today, nearly 225 years later, critics across the spectrum call the American political system dysfunctional, even pathological. What they dont mention, though, is the role of the Constitution itself in generating the pathology. , Ignore, for discussions sake, the clauses that helped to entrench chattel slavery until it was eliminated by a brutal Civil War. Begin with the Senate and its assignment of equal voting power to California and Wyoming; Vermont and Texas; New York and North Dakota. Consider that, although a majority of Americans since World War II have registered opposition to the Electoral College, we will participate this year in yet another election that battleground states will dominate while the three largest states will be largely ignored. , Our vaunted system of separation of powers and checks and balances - a legacy of the founders mistrust of factions - means that we rarely have anything that can truly be described as a government. Save for those rare instances when one party has hefty control over four branches - the House of Representatives, the Senate, the White House and the Supreme Court - gridlock threatens. Elections are increasingly meaningless, at least in terms of producing results commensurate with the challenges facing the country. , But if one must choose the worst single part of the Constitution, it is surely Article V, which has made our Constitution among the most difficult to amend of any in the world. The last truly significant constitutional change was the 22nd Amendment, added in 1951, to limit presidents to two terms. The near impossibility of amending the national Constitution not only prevents needed reforms; it also makes discussion seem futile and generates a complacent denial that there is anything to be concerned about. , It was not always so. In the election of 1912, two presidents - past and future - seriously questioned the adequacy of the Constitution. Theodore Roosevelt would have allowed Congress to override Supreme Court decisions invalidating federal laws, while Woodrow Wilson basically supported a parliamentary system and, as president, tried to act more as a prime minister than as an agent of Congress. The next few years saw the enactment of amendments establishing the legitimacy of the federal income tax, direct election of senators, Prohibition and womens right to vote. , No such debate is likely to take place between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. They, like most contemporary Americans, have seemingly lost their capacity for thinking seriously about the extent to which the Constitution serves us well. Instead, the Constitution is enveloped in near religious veneration. , What might radical reform mean?, We might look to the 50 state constitutions, most of which are considerably easier to amend. There have been more than 230 state constitutional conventions; each state has had an average of almost three constitutions. (New York, for example, is on its fifth Constitution, adopted in 1938.) This year Ohioans will be voting on whether to call a new constitutional convention; its Constitution, like 13 others, including New Yorks, gives voters the chance to do so at regular intervals, typically 20 years. , Another reform would aim to fix congressional gridlock. We could permit each newly elected president to appoint 50 members of the House and 10 members of the Senate, all to serve four-year terms until the next presidential election. Presidents would be judged on actual programs, instead of hollow rhetoric. , If enhanced presidential power seems too scary, then the solution might lie in reducing, if not eliminating, the presidents power to veto legislation and to return to true bicameralism, instead of the tricameralism we effectively operate under. We might allow deadlocks between the two branches of Congress to be broken by, say, a supermajority of the House or of Congress voting as a whole. , One might also be inspired by the states to allow at least some aspects of direct democracy. California - the only state with a constitution more dysfunctional than that of the United States - allows constitutional amendment at the ballot box. Maine, more sensibly, allows its citizenry to override legislation they deem objectionable. Might we not be far better off to have a national referendum on health care reform instead of letting nine politically unaccountable judges decide?, Even if we want to preserve judicial review of national legislation, something Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. believed could be dispensed with, perhaps we should emulate North Dakota or Nebraska, which require supermajorities of their court to invalidate state legislation. Why shouldnt the votes of, say, seven of the nine Supreme Court justices be required to overturn national legislation?, Or consider the fact that almost all states have rejected the model of judges nominated by the president and then confirmed by the Senate. Most state judges are electorally accountable in some way, and almost all must retire at a given age. Many states have adopted commissions to limit the politicization of the appointment process. , What was truly admirable about the framers was their willingness to critique, indeed junk, the Articles of Confederation. One need not believe that the Constitution of 1787 should be discarded in quite the same way to accept that we are long overdue for a serious discussion about its own role in creating the depressed (and depressing) state of American politics. , , Levinson, a professor of law and government at the University of Texas, is the author of \"Framed: Americas 51 Constitutions and the Crisis of Governance.\" The article is republished with permission from The New York Times.]", "Date": "20120601", "Title": "[Blame the Constitution for our dysfunctional government]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Blame-the-Constitution-for-our-dysfunctional-3602902.php", "Author": "[By Sanford Levinson]"}

Marco Rubio (R-Florida) used campaign cash during his time in the Sunshine States Legislature. , When Rubio entered the Florida House of Representatives in 2000, the then 28-year-old was laden with debt. The Tampa Bay Times described him as \"barely solvent\" as he plotted his ascent to Speaker of the House in 2006 and the lead up to his 2009 run for the U.S. Senate.During this time, Rubio apparently usedthe resources of his two political committees and an American Express credit card from the state Republican Party for some of his personal expenses. , The Miami Herald and the Tampa Bay Times investigated Rubios questionable bookkeeping in 2010. Those reports showed Rubios free use of his party credit card to cover personal expenses like a $135 haircut, trip to a local liquor store and $10,000 family vacation. Rubio said at the time that honest bookkeeping mistakes were made and insisted he reimbursed the state party when necessary to pay for personal charges. , Mother Jones revisited those reports this week and suggested Rubios handling of his finances could \"bring national scrutiny\" and haunt him as he is poised to pursue a White House bid in 2016. , Reached for comment, Rubio spokeswomanBrooke Sammon dismissed the Mother Jones and Florida press reports. , \"That report was nothing more than proven inaccuracies and false attacks from liberals trying to distract from Senator Rubios optimistic vision for our country in the 21st century,\" Sammon told Business Insider. , The allegations surrounding Rubios finances fall in two major areas, his credit card usage and his political committees. , During his time in the Florida House, Rubio started two separate political committees, Floridians for Conservative Leadership andFloridians for Conservative Leadership in Government. The groups received an estimated $600,000 in less than three years. , Floridians for Conservative Leadership, Floridians for Conservative Leadership in Government , Rubio was dogged by questions about his spending when he ran against then-Florida Gov.

{"Content": "[ As we roll into the 2016 election, all the candidates should expect to be asked: What keeps you awake at night? They have many issues from which to pick. , There has never been in recent decades such an abundance of complex international dilemmas: Islamic terrorism, rampant Middle East instability, Russian imperial designs in Ukraine and elsewhere, Chinas growing military muscle, and a potentially unstable leader in nuclear North Korea. All of these present possible nightmare scenarios for policymakers and average citizens alike. , My years in the intelligence business, including as former CIA chief of Iranian operations, lead me to believe, however, that we will somehow muddle through these challenges over the next decade. What should give us sleepless nights is the challenge posed by the very real possibility of nuclear weapons proliferation, and the attendant threat of a nuclear event, which would rock modern society to its foundation. We have dealt with the threat of proliferation for some time, but the great power toolbox seems to be shrinking, just at a time when potential proliferation dovetails with a region wrought by intractable instability. The fate of the Iran nuclear deal could determine which way the scale tips in the Middle East. , The highly controversial nuclear deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, stalls Irans development temporarily. This is a C- deal; not great, not terrible. The Iranians will adhere to its terms through the 2016 presidential elections and until it reaps the benefits of lifted sanctions and the release of 100 billion in frozen assets. But in possibly three to five years time, if the past is any guide, Iran will likely begin cheating on the agreement. They will continue to develop nuclear support capabilities at sites we are not inspecting. Intelligence agencies have a poor record of divining Iranian intentions and actions. Moreover, should we suspect cheating, our ability to \"snap back\" sanctions will be virtually impossible in practice. , Although King Salman seems to have signaled that Saudi Arabia unenthusiastically supports the Iran deal, his support depends on the snap back provision. If Iran cheats and sanctions fail to materialize, the Saudis will very likely make good on their threats to match Irans nuclear capabilities. Regional players such as Turkey, Egypt and the UAE could well follow suit. Although nuclear programs arent built overnight, Saudi Arabia certainly has the resources and access to expertise to make it a reality. Already Saudi Arabia has launched an ambitious nuclear power program stating its plans to build sixteen nuclear power reactors over the next two decades, which will lower barriers to a nuclear weapons capability. Turkey and Egypt are also in the planning stages, and the UAE has three of four planned reactors under construction. , Rather than waiting on Iran to cheat, we should continue to place vigorous pressure on proliferation in the Middle East. The 2015 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference just concluded in May without any progress in advancing the badly needed Middle East Nuclear Weapons Free-Zone. Whats more, there is no indication that this will be successfully addressed any time soon. This is not a high risk problem we can afford to muddle through. , There are many dangerous geopolitical challenges that confront us today, but only a nuclear exchange represents an existential threat to all of us. As global instability increases along with nuclear aspirations in the Middle East, we must keep nuclear weapons proliferation at the top of our and our allies national security agendas, and work relentlessly to reduce the existing pool of nuclear weapons. Above all, as we go forward, we need to put down an indelible marker that no nation can develop nuclear weapons for its arsenal, and that we will do whatever it takes, including using military force to prevent it. This needs to be made crystal clear. If Iranians do not believe there is a red line on this issue, then we have a three- to five-year agreement, not a 15-year agreement. , To fail to change Irans mindset, would be to set up the world for many sleepless nights. , , Devine is a former CIA deputy director of operations, president of The Arkin Group and author of \"Good Hunting: An American Spymasters Story,\" published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux (2014) and Picador (2015). ]", "Date": "20150804", "Title": "[Devine: Fate of Iran deal makes for sleepless nights]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Devine-Fate-of-Iran-deal-makes-for-sleepless-6424839.php", "Author": "[By Jack Devine]"}

The organizer of a conservative political convention rescinded the businessmans prime-time speaking slot, angering those eager to hear from the businessman. , The real estate mogul and reality television star remained unbowed, refusing to apologize for saying on CNN that Megyn Kelly, who aggressively questioned him during Thursdays GOP primary debate, had \"blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever\" when she asked him about his incendiary comments toward women. , At the least, the latest flare-up underscored the potential challenges Trump poses for his rivals as they struggle to react to him without deviating from their own message or alienating the conservatives who are enamored with his insurgent, unconventional bid. , Jeb Bush said Trump threatens the GOPs 2016 prospects with female voters, who already favor Democrats in presidential elections. \"Do we want to win? Do we want to insult 53 percent of our voters?\" the former Florida governor told the RedState Gathering in Atlanta, where Trump had been the headliner for an evening reception at the College Football Hall of Fame. , The events organizer, radio host Erick Erickson, offered similar sentiments when he booted Trump after his statements on CNN. \"I just dont want someone on stage who gets a hostile question from a lady and his first inclination is to imply it was hormonal,\" Erickson wrote on his website, even as he acknowledged that Trump \"resonates with a lot of people with his bluntness.\", In a statement, Trump maintained that \"only a deviant\" would interpret his comments that way. He called Erickson \"a total loser\" with \"a history of supporting establishment losers in failed campaigns.\", Former tech executive Carly Fiorina, the only woman among the GOP contenders, took to Twitter: \"Mr. Trump. There. Is. No. Excuse.\" She added, \"I stand with @megynkelly.\", Rick Perry, the former Texas governor, said Trumps behavior shows \"a serious lack of character and basic decency\" that should disqualify him from the race. , Even before Trumps latest Kelly comments, New Jersey Gov.

Im not running for social media critic of somebody else whos running for president.\", Yet Trump remains a towering presence in the 17-candidate field, and his supporters at the RedState event  along with several other uncommitted attendees  said the latest flap simply reaffirms why his uncompromising approach appeals to voters who are disgusted with conventional politicians, including those in the GOP. , \"It sounds like Republicans want to cherry-pick someone as the nominee and they want everyone to fall in line,\" said Jane Sacco of New Port Richey, Florida, saying she was angry at Ericksons decision. , Another Trump fan, Louise Tashjian of Atlanta, added: \"This is about political correctness. We dont like it when Democrats do it.\", Dulcy Forte of Austin, Texas, countered that Trumps bigger sin was his refusal in the debate to pledge support to the eventual GOP nominee if its not him. \"I was always thought Donald Trump was a little crude, but, more importantly, hes not a good Republican,\" Forte said. , Still more attendees said they are not necessarily Trump supporters but want other candidates and party leaders to take heed of his rise. , Connie Thomas of Atlanta, executive of a health care consultancy, said Trump went \"too far\" in the CNN interview but is serving a \"good purpose\" in the race: \"Hes forcing the rest of this field to speak more forcefully, more clearly against the establishment.\", Jack Staver, a business consultant from Woodstock, Georgia, said Trumps rivals could benefit from emulating his style, even if it gets him into trouble. \"Quit being who everybody wants you to be, and be who you are,\" Staver said. \"I havent seen a lot of that in this campaign.\", Some other candidates have at least tacitly acknowledged the tightrope they must walk with Trumps supporters. , Bush was the only one of a half-dozen candidates at the RedState gathering who mentioned Trump during his remarks on the podium. And in recent weeks, Bush has on several occasions differentiated Trump from his backers, whom he calls \"good people.\", Huckabee, even in his frustration Saturday, said Trump has \"tapped into an anger\" among the electorate. \"Im angry, too,\" he said. , Meanwhile, the flap has reached into Trumps campaign operation. His campaign announced Saturday afternoon that he had fired one of his top advisers, Roger Stone. However, Stone maintained that he quit Saturday morning after seeing Trumps CNN comments from Friday night. , According to an email obtained by the Associated Press, Stone wrote to Trump, \"The current controversies involving personalities and provocative media fights have reached such a high volume that it has distracted attention from your platform and overwhelmed your core message.\", Trumps campaign manager said he never received the email. , __, Associated Press writer Jill Colvin in Washington contributed to this report. , Follow the reporters on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP and https://twitter.com/sbustosAP .]", "Date": "20150810", "Title": "[Trump's rivals criticize comment about female moderator]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/GOP-candidates-ride-debate-momentum-to-RedState-6432481.php", "Author": "[Bill Barrow and Sergio Bustos, Associated Press]"}

{"Content": "[ AUSTIN  A top lieutenant for Speaker Joe Straus is proposing the House allocate more money for border security to fund an unspecified number of new troopers along the Texas-Mexico perimeter, a plan being pitched as one that would end the need for future high-profile border surges. , State Rep. Dennis Bonnen, R-Angleton, unveiled a wide-ranging border security measure Monday that, in part, authorizes Department of Public Safety troopers to work 10 hour days, imposes tougher penalties on smugglers and allows DPS to set up checkpoints within 250 yards of the border. The bill also would create a \"DPS Officer Reserve Corps\" of retired troopers to help police with background checks and sex offender compliance. , The main thrust of Bonnens proposal is to end the states \"off again, on again\" approach of calling up troopers from all over Texas to implement so-called surge missions. , \"Were stopping the surge and stop. Were creating a long-term plan,\" said Bonnen, who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee and was flanked by about three-dozen lawmakers at a news conference Monday. , State officials last summer OKd tens of millions of dollars in taxpayer money to fund a surge operation led by the DPS to deal with an influx of Central American children pouring into Texas. Late last year, officials approved another $86 million to continue the surge, with the bulk of that money being directed to keep the increased DPS presence along the border through August. , Roughly seven weeks into 140-day legislative session, border security has remained a hot topic at the Capitol. , Gov. Greg Abbott has named it an emergency item, setting the issue on the fast track for passage in the first 60 days of the legislative session. He also voiced support for keeping National Guard troops in the border region until DPS can beef up its ranks there with an additional 500 state troopers and Texas Rangers. Abbott has recommended doubling border security spending. , The Senate is proposing about $800 million for border security in its starting-point budget, while the Houses base budget includes roughly $400 million for border security. , On Monday, Bonnen did not release any concrete figures for an expected cost or an anticipated number of new troopers for border. He said the House Appropriations Committee will figure out that part. , State Rep. John Otto, the Houses top budget writer, said full implementation of the bill will require the lower chamber to add to its starting point budget for border security. He declined to offer a potential dollar figure, saying his committee would know more after hearing from DPS Director Steve McCraw at a Tuesday hearing. , \"The base was never intended to cover the ultimate solution that has been unveiled today,\" said State Rep. John Otto, R-Dayton, and the Houses top budget writer. \"The House is committed to funding what is necessary to accomplish the goals that have been laid out in this piece of legislation.\" , Asked how many new troopers would be needed along the border, Otto also declined to provide an estimate, saying, \"I will know better tomorrow after Col. McCraw tells us how many troopers he can train and get deployed on the border.\" , Democrats Monday said they needed to fully vet the bill but cautioned that the measure could have unintended consequences. State Rep. Rafael Anchia, D-Dallas, said Democrats will be focused on ensuring the proposed checkpoints \"dont inhibit lawful trade\" and that additional trooper deployments make sense financially. , \"Im all about looking at the numbers to make sure the tax payer money were spending is being used wisely and has an important return on investment,\" he said.]", "Date": "20150302", "Title": "[Lawmaker offers plan to make DPS border presence permanent]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/texas/article/Lawmaker-offers-plan-to-make-DPS-border-presence-6111051.php", "Author": "[By David Saleh Rauf]"}

He had originally used state taxpayer money to defend himself in the case, racking up at least $80,000 in legal expenses for one lawyer. , But Perry eventually bowed to public pressure, changing course days after being indicted and announcing he would use his campaign account to pay his legal tab. , According to state data, Perry spent upward of $1.1 million on \"legal defense\" since the last week of August. Nearly 40 percent of the legal fees  more than $455,000 went to the law firm of lead counsel Tony Buzbee, a well-known Houston attorney. , The rest was divided among firms associated with attorneys Ben Ginbsberg, a lawyer involved in the 2000 presidential election recount; Tom Phillips, former chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court; Bobby Burchfield, general counsel for George H.W. Bushs presidential re-election campaign; and David Botsford, a prominent Austin lawyer who represented Perry during the grand jury process. , Perry was indicted Aug. 15 on two felony charges stemming from his threat to veto funding for the state Public Integrity Unit unless Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg resigned following a highly publicized drunk-driving conviction. Lehmberg, whose office houses the unit, refused to step down, and Perry carried through with the veto. , Shortly after he was indicted, he hired a high-powered legal squad that helped amplify his argument that the case is a political witch hunt. , A judge refused to dismiss the indictment on technical grounds in November. A ruling on Perrys effort to get the indictment tossed on constitutional issues is expected soon. , Perrys new campaign finance report also shows his political account started collecting big contributions again. During the first half of the year, Perrys political action committee raised about $9,000, but in the last six months of 2014, it took in more than $376,000. , Just three donors  all of them longtime Perry benefactors  were responsible for more than 93 percent of the latest haul. James Pitcock, chairman and CEO of Williams Brothers Construction, provided more than half the total, writing a $200,000 check for Perry in September. Peter Holt, owner of the San Antonio Spurs, gave Perry a combined $100,000. And Fort Worth billionaire Lee Bass chipped in $50,000. , Perry spent $2 million during the period and reported cash-on-hand of $2.9 million. , drauf@express-news.net, patrick.svitek@chron.com]", "Date": "20150116", "Title": "[Perry spends $1M in campaign cash fighting indictment]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/texas/article/Perry-spends-1M-in-campaign-cash-fighting-6019154.php", "Author": "[By David Saleh Rauf and Patrick Svitek]"}

{"Content": "[ AUSTIN  When Jimmie Don Aycock was asked to run for the state House a decade ago, he went into his barn and fashioned a \"truth in government pipe\" out of a piece of scrap copper. On one end he drilled an \"S\" for \"spending\" and on the other, a \"T\" for \"taxes.\", As House Education Chairman, he has turned to that small piece of copper to remind himself and others that \"government cant separate what we spend from what we tax.\" On Monday, he will announce he is not seeking re-election, putting away the pipe for the last time. , \"Theres about a thousand reasons\" he will not seek re-election, Aycock told the Chronicle. The Killeen Republican is considered by members of both parties as one of the most trusted and honest members in either chamber. Hes so ethical, Houston Democrat Harold Dutton recently mused, that \"hes the kind of guy youd buy a used car from, and wouldnt look under the hood.\", He also has been incredibly productive in his nine years, passing major education reform bills like 2013s House Bill 5, which cut end-of-course exams for high school students, among other things. The legislative life, however, really never has been for him, he said. , \"Ive never really enjoyed being at the mic and arguing,\" said the soft-spoken former veterinarian and rancher. He and Marie, his wife of almost 50 years from which he says he is inseparable, are \"anxious\" to return to \"family and farm life.\", \"I had a really good life before I did this,\" Aycock said chuckling. He described his seven years of retirement before he ran for the House as \"wonderful, gloriously wonderful.\", Aycock, 68, was born and raised in Bell County. He was a member of First Baptist Willow Grove Church, where he met his wife as a child. He attended Moody High School, where he graduated as valedictorian, and Texas A&M, where he received both his Bachelors and Doctor of Veterinary Medicine. , He did not run for state elected office until he was in his late 50s, but he was no stranger to public service, having served as the head of the Greater Killeen and Harker Heights chambers of commerce and as president of two local water boards. He also sat on a school board in the mid-to-late 1980s, where he became intimately familiar with the long-time struggles of Texas public schools. , It is his public school reforms, including House Bill 5, for which he likely will be remembered best. Texas Monthly named his one of the best lawmakers in 2013 for just that reason. He considers his greatest achievement in the state Legislature to be his role in helping Texas A&M-Central Texas become a stand-alone university. , This session, he unsuccessfully attempted to push a major reform of the states method of funding public schools. Bucking the desires of most other Republicans to wait for the Texas Supreme Court to rule on whether the school finance system is unconstitutional, Aycock and his staff undertook months of statistical analyses to come up with what he thought was a first step toward an eventual fix. , It quickly became evident the bill would be killed in the Senate, however, so Aycock pulled it down when it reached the House floor to enable debate on other bills. The House gave him a standing ovation that day, to thank him for not holding up the calendar. Aycock, visibly emotional, said that was a great honor. , \"I just dont deal well with that,\" Aycock said of receiving such public admiration of his colleagues. \"I get emotional when a flag (goes by).\", Later that same day, Democrats opposed to his bill that would grade K-12 campuses on an A-F scale decided not to block debate on the measure in deference to Aycock. They said they did not want to do anything out of the respect they held for him. Now, that bill is now headed to the governors desk. , \"Its the way he conducts himself,\" Rep.

{"Content": "[ AUSTIN - Several Texas politicians, including Gov. Greg Abbott and GOP presidential hopeful U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, announced Monday that they would return or redirect donations from the head of a white supremacist group that apparently helped inspire the man accused of killing nine black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C. , Abbott said he would donate $1,000 from Earl Holt III of the Council of Conservative Citizens to the Salvation Army in Austin. , Cruz, R-Texas, initially said he would return Holts contributions. His office later put out a statement saying the senator had reconsidered and would use the $11,000 to help support the families of the Charleston shooting victims. , A Texas Supreme Court justice and at least two state lawmakers also said they would donate or return contributions from Holt, whose group became a lightning rod after an apparent online manifesto attributed to the accused killer, Dylann Roof, mentioned the Missouri-based Council of Conservative Citizens. , Holt, who said his group cannot be held responsible Roofs actions, has given $65,000 to Republican candidates over the years, according to Federal Election Commission reports. , Among the recipients were a number of White House hopefuls, including Cruz, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. Like Cruz, Paul and Santorum said they plan to give Holts donations to a fund created by Charleston Mayor Joe Riley to help the victims families. , Roof is charged with nine counts of murder in last weeks shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. All nine of the victims were black, and authorities said the killings were being investigated as a hate crime. , Mix the races, The young man is credited with an online diatribe written before the shootings saying that he has \"never been the same\" since he did a Google search for crimes by black people against white people. The manifesto said the search turned up the Council of Conservative Citizens website with \"pages upon pages\" of purported such murders. , Holt, whose contributions list him as having a Longview address, said his group does not advocate illegal activities. , The council \"is hardly responsible for the actions of this deranged individual merely because he gleaned accurate information from our website,\" said Holt, its president. , The Missouri-based group opposes \"all efforts to mix the races of mankind.\", Holt variously describes himself as a retiree and a \"slumlord\" in his FEC filings. He also has given money to a host of Republican candidates and organizations, from U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert of Tyler to the Senate Conservatives Fund. , The politicians rush to distance themselves from the Holt cash demonstrates the difficulty faced by campaigns, which may vet those who raise large sums but remain unfamiliar with smaller donors. , Abbott, for example, has received tens of millions of dollars in donations over a number of years that eclipse the two $500 donations from Holt in 2013 and 2014. , When controversy arises, the candidates have little choice but to cut their losses, political consultants said. , \"You need to return it,\" said Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak. \"There is little to no incentive to keeping contributions from someone like that, in that kind of situation. Id be surprised if anyone would keep the contribution.\", Mackowiak said he previously had not heard of Holt or his group. , \"I dont think anyone would argue that because you receive a check from someone that you are sort of giving some type of seal of approval to their beliefs or their background,\" he said. \"I dont really fault anyone for the situation. I think the only thing you can do is respond to it quickly.\", Other contributions, Others who said they would return money or make charitable donations included state Sen. Konni Burton, R-Colleyville; state Rep. David Simpson, R- Longview; and Texas Supreme Court Justice Jeff Brown. , Simpson said he would return money from Holt, whose contribution lists Longview as his address. He gave Simpson some $1,250, including $500 in 2013. , In addition, Simpson said he personally would make a donation to help the South Carolina church and affected families. , Unknown donor, \"I dont know the man that well. He has supported me. I just dont agree with, at least, the comments Ive read,\" said Simpson, who is planning to run for state Senate. \"I believe we are all made in Gods image. ... I dont want to have anything to do with running down other people, other races.\", Burton said in a statement, \"I will be personally donating $750 to a charity or local Charleston church to provide assistance to the families affected by this horrific violent act.\", Justin Dudley, Browns consultant, said his campaign is donating last years $250 donation from Holt to the Wounded Warrior Project. The donation came in response to a large direct-mail appeal, Dudley said. , The Austin American-Statesman reported Monday that state Rep.

A different appeals court already has upheld the Texas law, and its ruling was not appealed to the Supreme Court, ending that threat. , \"It would be very difficult to revive that challenge to the law,\" said Caitlin Borgmann, a professor at the CUNY Law School in New York. , Borgmann said opponents of the law could ask for the challenge to be reconsidered, but \"the courts are likely to say, weve already decided that issue.\", Lyle Denniston, a legal expert who writes for SCOTUSBlog, said a motion for reconsideration would be very unlikely to succeed. Absent a successful motion, he said, \"the Texas case is over and done.\", The 2011 law, written by now-Lt. Gov.

They then have to wait 24 hours before getting an abortion -- a waiting period that itself is an obstacle, particularly in a state that is losing clinics, opponents argue. , Similar laws are in effect in Louisiana and Wisconsin, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks abortion laws across the country. Oklahomas law is tied up in the courts, while 10 other states require doctors to perform an ultrasound and give women an opportunity to watch. , The Virginia-based 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals threw out North Carolinas law on First Amendment grounds, saying the law infringed on the free-speech rights of doctors.

Charles Schwertner framed the changes as a prerequisite to any discussions about expanding Medicaid in Texas. , \"Until we recieve the kind of federal flexibility were calling for here today -- the kind needed to fundamentally reform Texass existing Medicaid program in a way that preserves it for our most vulnerable Texans -- any expansion of Medicaid in Texas is simply not worth discussing,\" said Schwertner, R-Georgetown, a doctor who chairs the Senate Health and Human Services Committee. , Schwertner and Patrick noted in the news conference that Medicaid now covers about 4 million Texans, up from 2.1 million in 2002.

{"Content": "[ AUSTIN -- Texas Senate budget writer Jane Nelson on Thursday responded to critics of her role in an escalating dispute between the Legislature and the state agency that oversees horse racing, calling a demand for her to be investigated for abusing her power \"horse hockey.\", \"Its horse hockey, pure and simple, and it is making things worse  not better  for the Texas Racing Commission,\" Nelson said ina lengthy statement posted on her websiteabout the horse racing industry targeting her. , Industry official Jan Haynes responded to Nelsons response by ratcheting up her rhetoric even more, saying the senators statement was practically a confession to the allegations. , The dispute centers around the racing commissions approval last summer of \"historical racing,\" which allows players to bet on previously-run races that have been stripped of identifications. , The new game is seen by the tracks as a necessary innovation to help them keep up with states where more betting is allowed, but it has drawn opposition from critics who say the game terminals resemble slot machines and would expand gambling here. , Nelson and other Senate Republicans have said the commission did not have the power to approve the new game and moved during this years legislative session to reign in the agency by putting part of its budget under control of the Legislative Budget Board. , With only a couple weeks before the start of the next fiscal year, the Legislative Budget Board still has not released the funding -- a movebelieved to be aimed at forcing the commission to repeal its approval of \"historical racing.\", If the commission does not receive the money, it says it would have to close, which by extension would shutter the multi-million horse racing industry. , Haynes on Monday filed a complaint with the state Department of Public Safety, requesting a formal investigation into whether Nelson was \"bullying\" the racing commission. Industry officials say the case is similar to the veto threat that got former Gov. Rick Perry indicted last year. , In her statement, Nelson said it was nothing of the sort. , \"Unfortunately, there is a misguided effort under way to paint anyone opposed to slot machines as against the horse industry,\" said Nelson, adding, \"Throughout my time in the Legislature, I have been an ardent supporter of the horse racing industry.\", Nelson argued that the racing commission exceeded its authority by approving \"historical racing\" and lawmakers were within their rights to respond. , \"Lets be clear: the Legislature can decide what funding level every agency should receive, how those funds should be spent and what conditions should be placed on them,\" Nelson said. \"Moreover, the Legislature can decide whether an agency should continue to exist at all.\", Haynes said Nelson did not address the reality that the Legislature did not decide anything about \"historical racing,\" and that the senator was abusing her power on the Legislative Budget Board to get the outcome she wants -- repeal of the game. , \"Senator Nelsons response to my public corruption complaint is disingenuous at best,\" Haynes said. \"Senator Nelson makes no denial and practically confesses that she is tying a decision on Texas Racing Commission funding to whether or not they repeal the Historical Racing Rules.  Because there is not a shred of evidence that the Legislature intended this result, her statement validates what I said in my complaint.\", She added that Nelson has been a \"huge disappointment\" to the horse industry. , \"The only thing she gives us is lip service and when we have reached out for help, she has consistently refused and instead tried to harm the horse industry,\" Haynes said.]", "Date": "20150813", "Title": "['Horse hockey': Senator blasts back in racing commission dispute]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/texas/article/Nelson-responds-to-critics-of-her-role-in-Racing-6443320.php", "Author": "[By Brian M.

{"Content": "[ AUSTIN -- U.S. Sen. Rand Paul brought his likely presidential campaign here Sunday, using the annual South by Southwest festival as a stage for a trio of events aimed at portraying himself as the best option for young voters in Texas and across the country. , Paul, who grew up in Lake Jackson and has focused more than most any other potential 2016 contender on the nations largest Republican state, continued that approach by headlining a launch party for a new group to train young activists, answering questions at a festival interview and joining a Texas state senator for a Q&A featuring queries submitted on Twitter. , The Kentucky senator said at the beginning of each of the question sessions that he had not yet decided whether to run, saying a decision would come \"within weeks,\" which would square with the time frame he has set. But almost every other moment of a busy afternoon indicated he was in. , At one point during his interview with Texas Tribune CEO Evan Smith, Paul said he was \"the only candidate\" who wants to end the National Security Agencys program of collecting telephone records in bulk. , Asked at the Twitter event whether that meant he was officially running, Paul joked that he was a candidate -- for the Senate. His seat will be up in 2016. , Privacy proven a common theme throughout the events Sunday, in addition to liberty generally as well as criminal justice reform, a platform that Paul said would make him a \"completely different\" candidate than others with appeal across party lines and among young people. , \"The liberty movement brings right and left together in an extraordinary way,\" the self-described \"libertarian-ish\" senator said at his first event, a reception to launch Liberty Action Texas, founded by conservative consultants Jeff Frazee and Brendan Steinhauser. \"You can be liberal, you can be conservative, you can be an evangelical Christian, you can be a pot-smoking Austinite, and still believe in freedom and that the government oughta leave you alone.\", Paul expanded on that idea in his sit-down with Smith, calling for, among other things, an end to \"ridiculous, menial, misdemeanor type of crimes that were foisting on people to raise money\" and an end to the NSA program. , Told that state Rep. Jonathan Stickland had filed a bill to cut off electricity and water to NSA facilities in Texas, Paul said he would like to meet Stickland, although he later called the idea an example of hyperbole. , Paul accused Obama of executive overreach, defending his signing of a letter to Iran about a potential nuclear deal as necessary to reign in a president who \"doesnt understand the separation of powers.\", \"Whether its immigration, health care or war, hes gonna do whatever the hell he wants,\" Paul said. , The senator also attacked the likely Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton, over a recent scandal involving her use of a private email address as Secretary of State. , \"Convenience shouldnt trump national security,\" Paul said, referring to Clintons claim that she used the address for convenience. , He later said the scandal was representative of a general issue that Clinton thinks she is above the law. , Paul confronted a more immediate challenge than a general election at the Twitter Q&A with state Sen. Don Huffines, answering a question about how he can appeal to libertarians and mainstream Republicans. , \"Very carefully,\" he deadpanned, before calling himself a \"constitutional conservative\" who has \"sort of a foot in both camps.\", Paul is among a pack of likely 2016 Republican candidates from all wings of the party, including several with Texas ties, such as former Gov. Rick Perry, current U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whose family has deep roots here. , Steve Munisteri, who stepped down as chair of the Republican Party of Texas to advise Paul, said in an interview after the Twitter event that the senator recognizes the importance of the state. , Pauls visit to Austin will climax Monday, when he will open an office at startup incubator Capital Factory. , The incubators director, Joshua Baer, told reporters at the mansion of Gov.

{"Content": "[ AUSTIN, Texas (AP)  A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday that Texas voter ID law has a \"discriminatory\" effect on minorities in a victory for President Barack Obama, whose administration took the unusual step of bringing the weight of the U.S. Justice Department to fight a wave of new ballot-box restrictions passed in conservative statehouses. , The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the 2011 Texas law runs afoul of parts of the federal Voting Rights Act  handing down the decision on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the landmark civil rights law. , Texas was allowed to use the voter ID law during the 2014 elections, thereby requiring an estimated 13.6 million registered Texas voters to have a photo ID to cast a ballot. , The ruling was a victory, albeit not a sweeping one, for Democrats and minority rights groups. Whereas a Texas federal judge last year called the voter ID law the equivalent of a poll tax, a three-judge panel of the New Orleans court disagreed. It instead sent the law back to the lower court to consider how to fix the discriminatory effects. , Until then, Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said the law will remain in effect, though he did not acknowledge the issues raised by courts mixed ruling. , \"Im particularly pleased the panel saw through and rejected the plaintiffs claim that our law constituted a poll tax. The intent of this law is to protect the voting process in Texas, and we will continue to defend this important safeguard for all Texas voters,\" Paxton said. , Other Republican-controlled states, including Wisconsin and North Carolina, have passed similar voter ID measures in recent years, but the Texas law signed by then-Gov. Rick Perry is widely viewed as one of the nations toughest. It requires one of seven forms of approved identification, but unlike other states with voter ID restrictions, Texas doesnt recognize university IDs from college students. It does, however, accept concealed handgun licenses as proof of identity. , Free voting IDs are available from the state, but opponents have said getting those cards still put underlying financial costs on voters, such as paying for birth certificate copies and travel. , \"We believe in a secure ballot, but this law doesnt get us there. Now we have an opportunity to improve on the legislation and make sure the interests of the minority community are not ignored in this process,\" said Jose Garza, attorney for the Mexican American Legislative Caucus, one of the groups that sued over the voter ID law. , Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott called it \"imperative\" that Texas has a voter ID law, and said the state will continue fighting for the measure. , Democrats and minority rights advocates had early success in blocking the law. However, after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the heart of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, the path was cleared for Texas to enforce the new restrictions that supporters say prevent voter fraud. , Section 5, one of the parts of the act that was struck down, had forced certain state and local governments  including Texas  to get pre-clearance from the federal government before changing voting laws to ensure they were free of discrimination. , Without that provision to rely on, opponents of the voter ID law had to meet the higher threshold under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of proving the law discriminated against minority voters. , The New Orleans panel sustained the lower courts ruling that the law interacts with \"social and historical conditions in Texas to cause an inequality in the electoral opportunities enjoyed by African-Americans and Hispanic voters.\", The Justice Department had argued that the Texas law would prevent as many as 600,000 voters from casting a ballot. While there have been anecdotal reports of confusion, there were not widespread issues with voters being unable to cast ballots because they lacked proper identification. Garza said there is no way to measure the number of voters disenfranchised but said that, anecdotally, he knew of \"a lot\" of ballots in rural counties that had been rejected. , \"We are pleased that the Court of Appeals agreed unanimously with the district court that the Texas statute violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and we are studying the opinion in light of the future proceedings the Court of Appeals has ordered,\" U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement Wednesday. , Even though the lower court in Corpus Christi, Texas, found the law unconstitutional in 2014, it was allowed to remain in effect because the ruling had come so close to the election. , ", "Date": "20150805", "Title": "[Federal court says Texas voter ID violates Voting Rights Act]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/texas/article/Federal-court-strikes-down-discriminatory-Texas-6426737.php", "Author": "[Paul J.

As the states financial problems have grown in recent years, cuts have whittled away the agencys budget, shrinking it from $112 million in 2008 to about $90 million this year. , Such reductions make little sense, the lieutenant governor candidates told a tourism summit, if the state gets a 38 to 1 return on its investment in tourism efforts. , \"Why arent you taking care of the agency that brings so much money into the state of Louisiana?\" said Baton Rouge Mayor Kip Holden, a Democrat. , Three Republicans  former Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser, Jefferson Parish President John Young and state Sen.

He said the lieutenant governor needs to do a better job selling the importance of the industry around the state, highlighting the $800 million in tax revenue tourism generates. , He also said the state needs to work with local officials on New Orleans crime-fighting efforts, particularly in the French Quarter, or risk losing a top tourist draw to Louisiana. , \"If we dont get crime under control in the city of New Orleans, were going to kill the goose that laid the golden egg,\" Young said. , Nungesser said hed rally support from local officials to pressure lawmakers and the states next governor, to be elected this fall, to maintain funding to promote tourism, maintain state parks and museums and end the raid of tourism-related reserve funds. , Holden said hed work to secure more private investment for state parks and museums to provide operating cash. Both Holden and Guillory said theyd work to promote small Louisiana communities to tourists. , \"One of our priorities has to be the selling of Louisiana,\" said Guillory, of Opelousas. \"No other industry is as clean.

to convene an assembly apart from the U.S. Congress to discuss methods for maintaining autonomy from Washington, D.C. , RELATED:Feds raid Texas secessionist meeting, Both pieces were authored by Michael Leahy, a Tennessee-based conservative author and a founding voice in the Tea Party movement.

But serious consideration of the plan might not be far-fetched in the Lone Star State, which has made recent headlines for moves with slightly separatist undertones. In April, Gov.

(Johnny Hanson / Chronicle), As the citys historic Emancipation Park anticipates a grand... , In 1892, Houstons city fathers decided the time had come for East Broadway Street to become Dowling Street, in honor of Lt. Richard Dowling. Thirty years earlier, young Dick Dowling, a 25-year-old Irish immigrant and Houston barkeep, had become an instant Confederate hero when he and 42 artillerymen repelled 22 Union warships at the mouth of the Sabine River. , Perhaps it was coincidental, but the newly named streets most prominent feature was Emancipation Park, founded 20 years earlier by African-American community leaders, with money black churches had donated. Perhaps it was a coincidence, as well, that those same Houston city officials decided decided to bestow the name Tuam, Dowlings birthplace in Galway, Ireland, on the street runing along the parks northern border.  , As the citys historic Emancipation Park anticipates a grand reopening this year, Dowling and Tuam streets are among several street names, school names and memorials that commemorate a racist past best left to history books and museums. If South Carolina, where the Civil War began - and where its never really ended - can decide to take down the Confederate battle flag that flies on the grounds of the state capitol, then surely Houston and Texas can reassess their commemoration of a slave-holding, apartheid South, a regime dedicated to the notion of white supremacy and willing to defend it no matter the cost. , Houston can start by renaming Dowling Street, perhaps in time for the reopening of Emancipation Park. Interestingly, theres precedent for reassessing the local heros place in history. , A Dowling statue erected in front of the old City Hall in 1905 came down in 1939 and was stored away in a barn for nearly 20 years. Today it stands on the backside of Hermann Park, near the fifth green of the golf course. Most Houstonians rarely notice it. , At least four schools in the Houston Independent School District need to be renamed: Lee High School, named in honor of Gen. Robert E. Lee; Johnston Middle School, which honors Albert Sidney Johnston, another Confederate general; Jefferson Davis High School, named after the president of the Confederacy; and Dowling Middle School. Weve changed school mascots; now its time to change names. , Although Texas was on the periphery of the Confederacy compared to South Carolina and other Deep South bastions of a breakaway apartheid nation, the Lone Star State is replete with Confederate memorials. A Confederate-soldier statue stands guard over a number of county courthouse squares. More than 30 of those counties are named after Confederate figures (including Jeff Davis County in far West Texas). , Those counties are unlikely to be renamed, but other memorials are more easily changed. The statue of Davis has no place on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, where it has stood for decades. \"Given Jefferson Davis vehement support for the institution of slavery and white supremacy, we believe this statue is not in line with the universitys core values - learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility,\" stated a petition circulated by members of UTs student government. Newly installed UT-Austin President Gregory Fenves, to his credit, is giving the petitioners a respectful hearing. , We are well aware of the argument that commemorating the Confederacy is about heritage, not hate. Unfortunately, its a heritage of hate, as the Texas secessionists themselves made clear in their Statement of Causes, published on Feb. 2, 1861:, \"We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable.   .\", More than a century and a half after a war that tore apart this nation, thats the heritage we should be honoring?]", "Date": "20150624", "Title": "[Editorial: Rename Dowling Street]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/editorials/article/Rename-Dowling-Street-6345130.php", "Author": "[Copyright 2015: Houston Chronicle]"}

Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.In 1996, Leahy voted YES on the Defense of Marriage Act, prohibiting same-sex marriage. Leahy later expressed regret on his decision, saying \"When I voted for DOMA in 1996, I believed that it was a way to allow states to maintain their independence and define marriage as each state saw fit.\" , Laura BushThe former First Ladys stance on same-sex marriage and abortion was a bit different than her husbands, according to her memoir \"Spoken from the Heart.\" In an interview with CNNs Larry King in 2010, Bush said, \"There are a lot of people who have trouble coming to terms with that because they see marriage as traditionally between a man and a woman. But I also know that, you know, when couples are committed to each other and love each other, that they ought to have, I think, the same sort of rights that everyone has.\", Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.Like so many other senators, Murray voted YES on the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, prohibiting same-sex marriage. Murray later changed her stance, and in 2011 stated that she was planning to repeal the act entirely. It was noted that Murray never offered an explanation on why she voted for DOMA in the first place. , John KerryStrangely, Kerry voted NO on the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, but would later say states should be able to decide if they would allow same-sex marriages during his presidential campaign. In 2004, he went on record saying that while he supported same-sex unions, he believed marriage was between a man and a women. In 2011, Kerry quietly came out in support of same-sex marriage to the Boston Globe in an editorial. , Bill ClintonThe former Arkansas governor and U.S. president unceremoniously signed the Defense of Marriage Act into law in 1996 despite calling it \"gay-baiting.\" Years later, he said the law should be overturned, though some in the LGBT community are still upset that he signed into being in the first place, the New York Times reported. , Jimmy CarterAfter long supporting same-sex marriage, the former U.S. president confused many following an interview with Dallas WFAA-TV. In that interview, Carter flip-flopped on the issue, saying states, rather than the nation as a whole, should decide on legalizing same-sex marriage. \"I dont think that the government ought to ever tell the church to marry people, if the church doesnt want to ... Im kind of inclined to let the states decide individually.\", Vice President Joe BidenPrior to angering President Barack Obamas campaign staff in 2012 by openly supporting same-sex marriage, Biden issued support for same-sex civil unions but not marriage during a debate with Sarah Palin in 2008. In 2013, he repeated his support for same-sex marriage in an interview with Rolling Stone Magazine, saying \"Remember, I got criticized for saying I support gay marriage. I just decided I couldnt be quiet about it anymore, and everybody was stunned that thats where the public is. And Im not stunned; its where the publics been for a while. Talk to any of your kids, for Gods sake.\", President Barack ObamaIn 2006, Obama expressed opposition to same-sex marriage, but supported the concept of civil unions, saying churches and faith groups should be able to decide whether to call them marriages or not. In 2013, he regretted his distinction between unions and marriages. \"Ive always believed that gay and lesbian Americans should be treated fairly and equally. I was reluctant to use the term marriage because of the very powerful traditions it evokes. And I thought civil union laws that conferred legal rights upon gay and lesbian couples were a solution ... What Ive come to realize is that for loving, same-sex couples, the denial of marriage equality means that, in their eyes and the eyes of their children, they are still considered less than full citizens.\", Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev.In 1996, Reid voted YES on the Defense of Marriage Act, prohibiting same-sex marriage. His views must have evolved since then because in 2013, following the Supreme Courts ruling to strike down DOMA, he called it a \"great, historic day for equality in America.\"Source: Politico, Jon Huntsman, Jr.Just prior to the 2012 presidential election, Huntsman supported the concept of same-sex unions. A year later, he wrote in an editorial for the American Conservative that he was for same-sex marriage and encouraged others to do so as well. \"While serving as governor of Utah, I pushed for civil unions and expanded reciprocal benefits for gay citizens. I did so not because of political pressure--indeed, at the time 70% of Utahns were opposed--but because as governor my role was to work for everybody, even those who didnt have access to a powerful lobby ... That was 4 years ago. Today we have an opportunity to do more: conservatives should start to lead again and push their states to join the nine others that allow all their citizens to marry.\", Hillary ClintonThe former First Lady expressed support for the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, but supported same-sex civil unions and benefits for same-sex partnerships. In 2014, she claimed to have since evolved her views in support of same-sex marriage. \"I think youre reading it very wrong,\" she told CBS News. \"Just because youre a politician doesnt mean youre not a thinking human being. You gather information, you think through positions, youre not 100 percent set, thank goodness, youre constantly re-evaluating where you stand. That is true for me. One of my big problems right now is that too many people believe they have a direct line to the divine and they never want to change their mind about anything.\", Plenty of democrats cheered when same-sex marriage was legalized by the U.S. Supreme Court, but it must have been awkward for those who voted to ban it years before. , RELATED: Photos of Houston residents celebrating same-sex marriage ruling, In 1996, then President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act into law, prohibiting the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriage. The bill, H.R. 3396, passed the House and Senate with majority votes from both Republicans and Democrats. , At the time, Clinton thought the bill was \"divisive and unnecessary,\" but he signed it anyway. Most analysts agree he did it for political reasons, but some also think he failed to comprehend how damaging it would be to the LGBT community. , RELATED: Presidential candidates respond to SCOTUS ruling, In addition, a good number of the Democrats who signed it made distinctions between \"same-sex civil unions\" and \"same-sex marriage,\" saying that marriage should be determined by faith groups and individual churches. , Fast forward to today, some have admitted signing DOMA was a mistake while others never talked about it.

{"Content": "[ Caption, Close, , Last week, a zombie went to New Hampshire and staked its claim to the Republican presidential nomination. Well, OK, it was actually Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. But its pretty much the same thing. , You see, Christie gave a speech in which he tried to position himself as a tough-minded fiscal realist. In fact, however, his supposedly tough-minded policy idea was a classic zombie - an idea that should have died long ago in the face of evidence that undermines its basic premise, but somehow just keeps shambling along. , But let us not be too harsh on Christie. A deep attachment to long-refuted ideas seems to be required of all prominent Republicans. , Start with Christie, who thought he was being smart and brave by proposing that we raise the age of eligibility for both Social Security and Medicare to 69. Doesnt this make sense now that Americans are living longer?, No, it doesnt. This whole line of argument should have died in 2007, when the Social Security Administration issued a report showing that almost all the rise in life expectancy has taken place among the affluent. The bottom half of workers, who are precisely the Americans who rely on Social Security most, have seen their life expectancy at age 65 rise only a bit more than a year since the 1970s. Furthermore, while lawyers and politicians may consider working into their late 60s no hardship, things look somewhat different to ordinary workers, many of whom still have to perform manual labor. , And while raising the retirement age would impose a great deal of hardship, it would save remarkably little money. In fact, a 2013 report from the Congressional Budget Office found that raising the Medicare age would save almost no money at all. , But Christie - like Jeb Bush, who quickly echoed his proposal - evidently knows none of this. The zombie ideas have eaten his brain. , And there are plenty of other zombies out there. Consider, for example, the zombification of the debate over health reform. , Before the Affordable Care Act went fully into effect, conservatives made a series of dire predictions about what would happen when it did. It would actually reduce the number of Americans with health insurance; it would lead to \"rate shock,\" as premiums soared; it would cost the government far more than projected, and blow up the deficit; it would be a huge job-destroyer. , In reality, the act has produced a dramatic drop in the number of uninsured adults; premiums have grown much more slowly than in the years before reform; the laws cost is coming in well below projections; and 2014, the first year of full implementation, also had the best job growth since 1999. , So how has this changed the discourse? On the right, not at all. As far as I can tell, every prominent Republican talks about Obamacare as if all the predicted disasters have, in fact, come to pass. , Finally, one of the interesting political developments of this election cycle has been the triumphant return of voodoo economics, the \"supply-side\" claim that tax cuts for the rich stimulate the economy so much that they pay for themselves. , In the real world, this doctrine has an unblemished record of failure. Despite confident right-wing predictions of doom, neither the Clinton tax increase of 1993 nor the Obama tax increase of 2013 killed the economy (far from it), while the \"Bush boom\" that followed the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 was unimpressive even before it ended in financial crisis. Kansas, whose governor promised a \"real live experiment\" that would prove supply-side doctrine right, has failed even to match the growth of neighboring states. , In the world of Republican politics, however, voodoos grip has never been stronger. Would-be presidential candidates must audition in front of prominent supply-siders to prove their fealty to failed doctrine. Tax proposals like Marco Rubios would create a giant hole in the budget, then claim that this hole would be filled by a miraculous economic upsurge. Supply-side economics, its now clear, is the ultimate zombie: no amount of evidence or logic can kill it. , So why has the Republican Party experienced a zombie apocalypse? One reason, surely, is the fact that most Republican politicians represent states or districts that will never, ever vote for a Democrat, so the only thing they fear is a challenge from the far right. Another is the need to tell Big Money what it wants to hear: a candidate saying anything realistic about Obamacare or tax cuts wont survive the Sheldon Adelson/Koch brothers primary. , Whatever the reasons, the result is clear.

Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston has publicly come forward with a fellow house representative to denounce female genital mutilation and so-called \"vacation cutting season\" in the hopes of getting President Barack Obama and federal agencies to take steps to fight the practice here and abroad. In a press statement released on Thursday, the congresswoman thanked U.S. Representative Joe Crowley (D-NY), female genital mutilation survivor and activist Jaha Dukureh, plus international human rights organization Equality Now for devising this new call to action. , Dukureh tells her story of being mutilated as an infant in Gambia, finally making it to the United States at the age of 15 just a decade ago. She escaped a forced marriage there and fled to Atlanta where she currently resides. , \"It took away a part of my femininity, my ownership to my body. Some girls, including my half-sister who died from complications from being cut, even lose their lives,\" she writes in the materials for the Change.org petition to draw up an updated prevalence report on FGM in this country. , That petition now has just over 205,000 virtual signatures. , Female genital mutilation is illegal in the United States. Under the Girls Protection Act of 2011, it was made a federal crime to transportAmerican girls overseas for the purpose of FGM. The United Nations General Assembly has already deemed it a violation of human rights as well. According to the press release, vacation cutting season\" comes in the summer when girls are usually on break from American schools and are sent to other countries to undergo FGM to adhere to cultural norms. What Jackson, Crowley and 58 members of the U.S. House are calling for from top officials at the Departments of Justice, State, Health & Human Services, and Education, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the White House Office of Management and Budget is for a cross-agency plan to further fight FGM. This would include funding for resources to help law enforcement, health workers, and educators detect the practice here in this country, plus a hotline for girls who may be in danger of mutilation. The goal of all involved, stated in the press release, is to eradicate the practice globally. According to a World Health Organization fact sheet on the practice, FGM procedures intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. There are no health benefits, regarding FGM, only harm. FGM is typically carried out on girls and women between the ages of just a few months to the age of 15. According to WHO, over 125 million girls and women alive today have been cut in the 29 countries in Africa and Middle East where FGM is concentrated. The practice can cause numerous problems down the line for the victims, including severe bleeding, problems urinating, and infections and cysts. Some can even become infertile or have a risk of high infant mortality. By creating a national strategy, the U.S. would join the ranks of countries like the United Kingdom and Italy that, over the past decade, have begun adopting and supporting vigorous, pro-active practices to help end FGM,\" Lee said in the press release.]", "Date": "20140612", "Title": "[Sheila Jackson Lee's latest stance is against female genital mutilation]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/texas/article/SJL-house-reps-call-for-more-action-on-FGM-in-5548128.php", "Author": "[By Craig Hlavaty]"}

{"Content": "[ Caption, Close, , Remember the Texas economic miracle? In 2012, it was one of the three main arguments from then-Gov. Rick Perry about why he should be president, along with his strong support from the religious right and something else I cant remember (sorry, couldnt help myself). More broadly, conservatives have long held Texas up as a supposed demonstration that low taxes on the rich and harsh treatment of the poor are the keys to prosperity. , So its interesting to note that Texas is looking a lot less miraculous lately than it used to. To be fair, were talking about a modest stumble, not a collapse. Still, events in Texas and other states - notably Kansas and California - are providing yet another object demonstration that the tax-cut obsession that dominates the modern Republican Party is all wrong. , The facts: For many years, economic growth in Texas has consistently outpaced growth in the rest of America. But that long run ended in 2015, with employment growth in Texas dropping well below the national average and a fall in leading indicators pointing to a further slowdown ahead. In most states, this slowdown would be no big deal; occasional underperformance is just a fact of life. But everything is bigger in Texas, including inflated expectations, so the slowdown has come as something of a shock. , Now, theres no mystery about what is happening: Its all about the hydrocarbons. Texans like to point out that their states economy is a lot more diversified than it was in J.R. Ewings day, and theyre right. But Texas still has a disproportionate share of the U.S. oil and gas industry, and it benefited far more than most other states from the fracking boom. By my estimates, this extractive-sector windfall accounted for about a third of the difference between growth in Texas and growth in the rest of the country. , Like the rest of the Sunbelt, Texas is still benefiting from the long southward shift of Americas population that began with the coming of widespread air-conditioning; average January temperature remains a powerful predictor of regional growth. Texas also attracts new residents with its permissive land-use policies, which have kept housing cheap. , Now one of the three big drivers of Texas growth has gone into reverse, as low world oil prices are bringing the fracking boom to a screeching halt. Hey, things like that happen to every state now and then. But Texas wasnt supposed to be like other states. It was supposed to be the shining exemplar of the economic payoff to reverse Robin-Hood economics. , So its recent disappointments hit the right-wing cause hard - especially coming on the heels of the Kansas debacle. , For those who havent been following the Kansas story, in 2012, Sam Brownback, the states hard-right governor, pushed through large tax cuts that would, he promised, lead to rapid economic growth with little, if any, loss of revenue. But the promised boom never materialized, while big budget deficits did. , And, meanwhile, theres California, long mocked by the right as an economy doomed by its liberal politics. Not so much, it turns out: The budget is back in surplus in part because the emergence of a Democratic supermajority finally made it possible to enact tax increases, and the state is experiencing a solid recovery. , The states, Louis Brandeis famously declared, are the laboratories of democracy. In fact, Brownback himself described his plan as an \"experiment\" that would demonstrate the truth of his economic doctrine. What it actually did, however, was demonstrate the opposite- and much the same message is coming from other laboratories, from the stumble in Texas to the comeback in California. , Will anyone on the right take heed? Probably not. Unlike real experimenters, Brownback wasnt willing to take no for an answer, whatever happened, and the same is true for just about everyone on his side of the political divide. Or to put it another way, belief that tax cuts are a universal elixir that cures all economic ills is the ultimate zombie idea - one that should have died long ago in the face of the facts, but just keeps shambling along. Nothing that has happened in the past quarter-century has supported tax-cut mania, yet the doctrines hold on the Republican Party is stronger than ever. It would be foolish to expect recent events to make much difference. , Still, the spectacle of the Texas economy coming back to Earth, and Kansas sliding over the edge should at the very least make right-wing bombast ring hollow, in the general election if not in the primary. And someday, maybe, even conservatives will once again become willing to look at the facts. , , Krugman is a New York Times columnist.]", "Date": "20150605", "Title": "[Krugman: Texas 'miracle' more of Lone Star stumble]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Krugman-Texas-miracle-more-of-Lone-Star-stumble-6310160.php", "Author": "[By Paul Krugman]"}

Houston remained at $2.08, but the price was sliding and some spots offered sub-$2 fuel. The price of gas can be a mixed blessing in Houston, where low oil prices make driving cheaper but threaten to put some people out of work. Gas prices also affect development patterns.\"I think it will open up areas that may have seemed too remote before because now it will be more affordable to commute,\" Scott Davis, director of the Houston market for Metrostudy, told Chronicle real estate reporter Nancy Sarnoff recently. \"People will be willing to make that trade-off if they know theyll be seeing $2 instead of $3 gas.\", Grand Parkway: Along those outer development lines, the next segments of the Grand Parkway, set to open in late 2015, might be the most important new road in the Houston region since the western side of the Sam Houston Tollway was completed. The next segments connect U.S. 290, where the tollway ends now, to U.S. 59 north of Kingwood. Its a critical link to the area around The Woodlands, which is booming not only with new homes, but major new job centers. , Highway funding fix: A shortage of transportation money is becoming such a fixture of the Legislatures biennial gathering, its affecting lawmakers vocabularies. The phrase \"end diversions\" -- meaning the shifting of gas tax money to other purposes like policing highways -- is well know even by freshman House and Senate members. Texas, transportation experts estimate, is $5 billion in the hole in terms of needed spending on highways and alternatives to driving. Though theyve come into every session of Rick Perrys terms as governor aiming to align transportation spending with needs, lawmakers say they really, really mean it this time. Armed with a big win for Prop. 1 in November, they might have some success. , New bus routes: The new light rail lines have gotten most of the attention, but Metros plan to restructure its bus service will likely affect more transit users. Every route is being revised as part of theso-called reimagining plan, set to start in June. The goal, according to supporters, is to make travel around the region easier by creating frequent routes that criss-cross, fed by local service. It might mean more transfers for riders, but should also result in quicker trips. Skeptics worry Metro is making major changes to a system that just needs tweaks, and could limit local access. , Fare game: Last year Houston officials spent a lot of time debating allowing tech companies like Uber to partner with local drivers and offer service that competes with cabs. In November one of the companies pulled up stakes rather than comply with the new rules. This year, well see what the popular Uber service does to the ride market, and whether any of the dozens of small taxi companies in Houston close up shop and turn on the Uber app. , U.S. 290 widening: Its still going on, and will be for a while, but drivers might start seeing a lot of progress. The highways connection with Loop 610 is one of the regions worst bottlenecks, a problem that the construction and better access from U.S. 290 to and from Interstate 10 should address. It will also be important to see how discussions of the toll lane, or lanes, in the center proceed. Texas Department of Transportation officials are planning for just one lane, but there has been a push for at least two. , Suburban transit gets serious:Part of the mobility problem faced in Houston is that many people live in outlying suburban communities and commute back in to major job centers such as the central business district and Texas Medical Center. Unable to just keep widening roads and hoping solo drivers will sort things out, more suburbs are planning transit projects. Whether it isThe Woodlands and Conroe making plans for their own serviceto bolster park and ride access, orPearland plotting its first park and ridefacility, people are talking about transit in many places that for years avoided betting on buses. , Bike master plan:The other new trend taking hold in many areas of Houston is cycling, leading the city toupdate its bicycling master plan.\"The city has changed much in 20 years, the support and use of bicycling has increased significantly in 20 years, and we feel its time to revisit our planning for bicycle activities,\" Houston planning director Pat Walsh said last month. With a plan, local advocates believe they can correct many of the cycling challenges holding Houston back. Some of those efforts, however, are viewed with skepticism by drivers. City officials also plan a downtown bike lane along Lamar, set to open this year, which will connect miles of area trails. Thats abit later than they had hoped, but still a big step in cycling options. , New mayor:Annise Parker is in her last year, and the campaign to replace her has already started, even if not everyone has declared. Houstons mayoral hopefuls will have a lot of topics to debate, but expect the sorry state of some city streets, Parkers push for more bike trails and the Complete Streets edict she issued to be among them. The mayor also has a big role in setting Metros agenda, by way of appointing five of the agencys nine board members. , Interstate 45 widening: Work on the Gulf Freeway south of the Sam Houston Tollway, is years from completion, after years of work. Still, 2015 will be a big year for getting segments much further ahead. The widening, planned in two phases, will expand the freeway to five lanes, along with new frontage roads. Oscar Slotboom, who literally wrote the book on Houston Freeways, took some really detailed photos back in September, when the work was proceeding around Dixie Farm Road. , Interstate 45 widening (the other one): Widening I-45 north of the central business district to the Sam Houston Tollway wont start for years, but the plans will take a step forward when TxDOT releases its proposal.\"In my mind that is huge,\" spokeswoman Raquelle Lewis recently said. The project is certain to have its ups and downs, since the alternatives being considered include elevating managed lanes along the freeway or sinking some of the lanes. Residents, especially those on the north side of downtown, are very concerned about the noise and smog that comes from a bigger freeway. , Tomball Tollway: All of the major Houston suburbs have a major freeway to help connect folks, and Tomball is hoping to join that list. Though the city doesnt have Interstate 10 like Katy, Interstate 45 like The Woodlands or even Texas 288 like Pearland, its access via Texas 249 has helped turn it into a huge growth area. That will only accelerate, hopefully along with the speed of traffic, once the Tomball Tollway opens later this year. Though it will come at a price, officials believe the first leg fromsouth of Spring Cypress Road to just north of FM 2920 will be a catalyst for further development, though the future of Texas 249 isnt welcomed by all. , Uptown BRT: The plan to put dedicated bus lanes along Post Oak Boulevard was on pace for 2014 to be a big win, then everyone got stuck in a morass similar to the traffic situation in the Uptown area. After some back and forth about $25 million in state funds for elevated lanes along Loop 610, the project receded from view during November and December. Sometime in early 2015, its either going to go forward as planned or see some changes. Expect some political posturing along the way. , High-speed rail: This project has long been seen as a pipe dream, but the people behind Texas Central Railway are serious about building a bullet train between Houston and Dallas. Theyve held plenty of meetings to gauge public reaction, but the real test will come when federal officials and the private company unveil the final preferred route and start drilling down into the specifics of how to connect the two metros with a closed-off, 200-mph train line. , A plan to use half of Texas motor vehicle sales tax revenues to widen and improve the roads those cars and trucks rely on passed the Texas Senate Wednesday. , The proposal now moves to the House. Its expected to face more oppposition in the lower chamber than in the Senate, where it passed 28-2. Democratic Senators Rodney Ellis and Kirk Watson were opposed, citing concerns about limiting the discretion of future legislators. , This creates a mandatory entitlement for transportation, Watson, of Austin, said. , The plan, sponsored by Sen. Robert Nichols, R-Jacksonville, with support from Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, directs the first $2.5 billion of sales taxes on cars, trucks and other vehicles to the general fund. The next $2.5 billion would go directly to road spending. Any revenue above $5 billion would be evenly split, Nichols said. , Texas roads, clogged because of chronic underinvestment and rapid population growth, are falling further behind because local and state officials lack predictable funding that stymies their ability to plan major projects, Nichols said. By providing dedicated money, he said highway projects will be built faster because there will be more money and more ability to stagger them to avoid delays. , To extend the measure beyond 2016, voters will be asked to approve a constitutional amendment in November 2016.]", "Date": "20150304", "Title": "[State senate approves road spending plan]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/transportation/article/State-senate-approves-road-spending-plan-6114713.php", "Author": "[By Dug Begley]"}

{"Content": "[ Caption, Close, , Tim Draper, head of venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson on Sand Hill Road. , Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper will submit signatures Tuesday to put what could be one of the most dramatic startups ever on the ballot - a plan to divide California into six states. , Draper, a multimillionaire known as the Riskmaster, and his team are expected to announce in Sacramento that theyve gathered more than enough signatures to put the Six Californias measure before state voters. , The measure, a constitutional amendment, needs 807,615 valid signatures to qualify. Because the deadline has already passed for November, the plan could end up on the November 2016 general election ballot. , Supporters would not say how many signatures they have gathered until Draper holds a news conference Tuesday in Sacramento. But they said they were confident they had plenty to spare. , Democrats have denounced Drapers idea, and worry that an outpouring of conservative support and a lengthy campaign for the proposal could hurt both Gov. Jerry Brown in November and the partys presidential candidate in 2016. , \"This is a colossal and divisive waste of time, energy and money that will hurt the California brand\" as well as the states \"ability to attract business and jobs,\" said Democratic strategist Steve Maviglio. \"Its unfortunate that Mr. Draper is putting his millions into this effort to split up our state rather than help us face our challenges.\", But Roger Salazar - a Democratic strategist who has worked for former Gov. Gray Davis, 2000 presidential candidate Al Gore and the Clinton White House, and is now the spokesman for Drapers effort - called Maviglios take \"the pessimistic view.\", \"California is a beautiful place to live, and any time you can get new ideas and have a conversation, its a good thing for California,\" Salazar said. \"If it helps to make government more responsible, thats a good thing, too.\", Under Drapers plan, each of the six states would have its own government and own collection of elected officials, including congressional representatives. , A Field Poll in February showed 59 percent of Californians surveyed opposed the idea. Even if Draper can turn that around, there would be another major hurdle: The U.S. Constitution requires the approval of both Congress and the state Legislature, which is now firmly controlled by Democrats. , Under the proposal, San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose would be part of the state of Silicon Valley, which would extend to Santa Cruz and Monterey counties; San Diego and Orange counties would be in South California; Los Angeles, Santa Monica and Santa Barbara would be part of West California. , The Central Valley south of Stockton and the central and southern Sierra would be the state of Central California, while North California would include Marin and Sonoma counties and the greater Sacramento area. Rural counties in far Northern California would make up the state of Jefferson. , Draper, speaking to a crowd of tech insiders in San Francisco earlier this year, insisted his plan was not - as some critics have suggested - a means of getting more Republican representation in California. He said he was simply aiming to spread Silicon Valleys spirit of innovation to the entire state, which he said has been struggling with partisanship and lack of leadership as businesses decamp for better climates. , \"We have had really good people running California,\" he told the San Francisco crowd. \"Why is this not working?, \"Think of it as Sacramento being sort of ... rusted,\" said Draper, who is a registered independent. \"We need to do something structural, something fresh. ... If we dont try, were failing in our complacency.\", Draper must now submit his petitions to county registrars, who will have eight workdays to conduct an initial check to see if enough signatures are valid. If necessary, a thorough check could take an additional two months. , Draper is no stranger to the challenges of expensive state ballot measures. In 2000, he spent $20 million on a failed measure to support school vouchers. , When he first floated the Six Californias plan in February, Draper said he didnt plan on putting a lot of money into the measure. But that changed: Draper spent $1.3 million and hired the signature-gathering firm Arno Political Consultants, which paid collectors as much as $3 per signature. , Draper has admitted that the ballot measure is a longshot, though he said private polling shows some conservative regions, including the Central Valley, are in favor of it. , But he said can convince Californians that something must be done for a state that has \"the worst-managed government in the country.\", \"This is not going to happen overnight,\" he said. , Carla Marinucci is the senior political writer at The San Francisco Chronicle.

{"Content": "[ Caption, Close, A voter prepares to cast his ballot at an early voting polling site in Austin, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay), Imagine a simple voting reform that would drastically cut administrative costs, decrease the possibility of voter fraud and almost surely increase turnout. Who could be against such a reform? Candidates and officeholders who like to pick their own voters through gerrymandering and other tools to tamp down opposition turnout may be opposed, but most folks interested in seeing democracy work more effectively would endorse the reform immediately. , Were talking about online voter registration. Its one of several approaches states and municipalities around the country are trying these days, and theyre getting good results. Voting by mail is another. Another is reliance on so-called election-day vote centers. , Nineteen states allow citizens to register to vote online. State Rep. Carol Alvarado, D-Houston, tried to make Texas No. 20 during the recently concluded legislative session, but Republican opposition, including that of Harris County Tax Assessor-Collector Mike Sullivan, killed the bill. , Those states that allow it, including conservative Utah and South Carolina and liberal Washington and Oregon, have seen higher turnouts and no problems with voter fraud. The Washington Post reports, for example, that Arizona increased registration rates among voters ages 18-24 from 29 percent to 53 percent. , Theyve also experienced dramatic savings. Alvarado noted that Arizona, one of the first states to transition to online voter registration, reported the cost of a single registration dropped from 83 cents per card to 3 cents per card. , Oregon and Washington have instituted universal vote-by-mail, and both states have experienced dramatic increases in turnout. Coloradans have been voting by mail since 1992; the Rocky Mountain State regularly experiences 70 percent turnout and higher. , Texans, with the lowest civic participation rates in the country, cannot imagine a 70 percent turnout. Were more accustomed to a 24 percent turnout statewide for a mid-term election or a 14 percent rate in a local race, as San Antonio experienced in its recent hotly contested mayoral election. , Eleven states allow voters to register and vote on Election Day. These states have come to realize that same-day registration is not only convenient for voters, but it also allows them to complete the entire process under the supervision of state election workers. And voters can more easily keep their information current in the states database.  , The Election Day voting centers are non-precinct-based polling locations. Theyre located near workplaces, schools, shopping areas or along major transit routes, and theyre designed to be more convenient than smaller neighborhood polling places. According to Rice University sociologist and voting expert Bob Stein, theyre working well in 11 Texas counties and around the country.

{"Content": "[ Caption, Close, A woman shields herself from the rain as she walks through a parking lot on Milam Street, Wednesday, Feb. 6, 2013, in Houston. (Cody Duty / Houston Chronicle), A woman shields herself from the rain as she walks through a parking lot on Milam Street, Wednesday, Feb. 6, 2013, in Houston. (Cody Duty / Houston Chronicle), Its often said that in Houston, and Texas, we love our cars. While thats probably true, it also seems that we are obsessed about parking. Perhaps some Houstonians feel that free, easy parking adjacent to every building that were trying to access is an inherently essential feature of Houstons quality of life. The mandatory on-site parking requirements, one of the citys most intrusive land-use regulations, would seem to reflect this viewpoint. And parking controversies tend to generate vocal and emotional responses from the electorate. , As we enter the mayoral election season, I wouldnt be surprised if our candidates hear from citizens that our city isnt providing enough parking, so our officials need to \"fix it\" - in other words, do what it takes to get us closer to the ideal of easy-and-free parking anywhere we want to go, while no one else can park on our own street except me and my neighbors. , However, I wonder if the politicians and bureaucrats who hear this perspective from the citizenry realize the prices paid for all the vast supply of parking that is implied to be necessary. While I could highlight many ways that the omnipresence of parking as a land use can negatively affect us, such as excessive and polluted storm runoff and urban heat islands, I want to focus on two main impacts: the reduced appeal and effectiveness of walking and the terrific financial burden our obsession with parking places on both the private and public sector. , The negative impacts on walking as a means of mobility and access are pretty obvious. Massive on-site parking supply pushes destinations apart, meaning fewer destinations are available within a reasonable walking distance, diminishing the practicality of getting around on foot. Off-street parking facilities are also generally unpleasant to walk next to or through, reducing the qualitative experience of being a pedestrian as well. With such conditions, even folks who might not be predisposed against walking will be more likely to drive to and between their destinations (thus creating more traffic and pollution). In short, excessive on-site parking and walkable environments are not terribly compatible. , Of course, the traffic congestion and health impacts are becoming more widely known as consequences of a lack of walkability. Not to mention the burden placed on those who walk because, for whatever reason, theyre unable to drive. Finally, from a more purely qualitative perspective, there are those who actually like walking in cities and who are denied that experience. , The negative impact of the financial burden of excessive and poorly located parking may be even more pernicious, however. It would be silly to declare parking unnecessary at the present time, especially for most commercial uses in Houston; our relatively lower densities and sparse public transit network mean that parking is necessary for a sufficient number of employees, customers  and visitors to access destinations. But onsite parking, mandated by Houston city code and perceived as necessary regardless of code by most developers, comes at great cost - it takes extra money to build parking, not to mention to acquire and use the underlying land for that purpose. What ends up happening is that enormous resources are spent purely for vehicle storage, rather than using that capital and land for actual economic activity. Where does the Houston economy actually take place? Usually in buildings, not in parking lots or garages - yet what quantity of underutilized financial resources are locked into parking? How much more expensive, or financially tenuous, is a development project than it otherwise would have been if more land could be used productively? How might our built environment improve if more could be spent on creating quality buildings and more affordable housing rather than creating more parking?, There are serious ramifications for the citys fiscal health in this regard. I researched the assessed values of various types of recently built properties in the Washington Avenue corridor. An unwalkable parking-oriented retail big-box strip center development, dominated by surface parking, produces significantly lower taxable property value than a multifamily apartment development with a parking garage built underneath the living units. The retail property also produces less assessed value per acre than nearby single family town homes, even if a 20 percent homestead exemption is assumed on all units. , One might point out that while retail lags on property-tax generation, it also produces sales tax for the city. This is true, but my calculations indicate that a typical retail center would need unrealistic levels of taxable sales productivity to approach the tax base generated by the multifamily apartments. , I can tell you from my other experiences in consulting work that these examples of assessed value generation are quite typical. Parking, however seemingly necessary, hurts walkability and hurts municipal fiscal productivity. , So where does this leave Houston? The city has enormous fiscal challenges. While certainly managing the expenditure side of the budget is critical regardless of how much revenue is coming in, allowing or encouraging low fiscal value development forced by both the mandatory and perceived need for excessive on-site parking is not a situation that should continue. Solutions will likely include some mix of relaxation or elimination of on-site parking requirements, community-shared parking facilities, better provision and management of on-street parking, improved public transit and eventually autonomous (self-driving) vehicles that do not have to be parked right at the destination. And as or more important, Houston needs improvements both in the design of developments and in the public rights of way to facilitate safe, comfortable walking. , Houstons current densification trend provides a great opportunity to try out these options. A number of them can be directly influenced by public policies administered by the mayor and city administration. , Id like to hear from our candidates if they have contemplated changes to the citys parking policies and, if so, what? After all, they have to live with the fiscal consequences. , We often think of walkabilitys potential to improve our health, our natural environment and our city image. But just as important, it can help save our collective checkbook. , , Spillette is president of Houston-based CDS Market Research. His views do not represent those of the firm.

John McCain will point to his success in bringing important projects to Arizona and his new influence as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee as key reasons why voters should return him to Congress for a sixth term. , Arizonas senior senator said in a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press Tuesday that hes not taking a primary challenge from Republican state Sen. Kelli Ward and other potential GOP challengers for granted and plans an aggressive primary campaign. , Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick is seeking the Democratic nomination and could mount a strong general election challenge as well. , \"I take any campaign, both primary and general, with the utmost seriousness,\" McCain said. \"And anybody who in this day and age does (not) do so is just foolish.\", McCain pointed to his efforts to reopen a fish hatchery in Mohave County, pushing a highway bypass in Pima County and a land swap that opened the way for a new copper mine near Superior as successes. He also touted his work to bring more work to Tucson-based Raytheon Missile Systems, keep the Air Force from retiring the A-10 attack jet and bringing squadrons of new F-35 attack jets to Luke Air Force Base and Yumas Marine Corps Air Station. , \"The message is, Im proud of my record of service to the state of Arizona,\" said McCain, who was the Republican nominee for president in 2008 and will be 80 by next Novembers general election. \"Theres a large number of Arizona-specific work that Ive done.\", McCain said his leadership on national security issues is particularly needed amid growing threats from the Islamic State, Russia and China. He said he will be able to shape the U.S. debate on how to address the challenges. , \"I guess it sounds like bragging  but who is the foremost spokesperson on national security in the United States Senate?\" McCain said. \"You can ask any journalist or expert in America  its me. And in a most dangerous world my knowledge and expertise and leadership will play a key role, particularly with the next administration.\", McCain faced a primary challenge in 2010 from former Rep. J.D. Hayworth, and trounced him after promising to boost border security.

The legislation stalled in the House, leaving border security and what to do with an estimated 11 million people in the U.S. illegally an outstanding political issue. , \"I know that the border is a very, very important issue to many citizens of Arizona,\" McCain said. \"Thats why I was the one who passed legislation through the Senate that requires 90 percent effective control of the border, 100 percent situational awareness, 6 billion dollars, 20,000 additional Border Patrol. Im proud of that legislation.\", The reform bill also contained expanded farmworker and professional visa provisions, and a provision that required employers to check work authorization though the federal e-verify system. , \"When I said we were going to build the danged fence, thats what that legislation does,\" McCain said. \"If they have a better idea of how to have a comprehensive approach to immigration reform, first and foremost being border security, then Ill be glad to hear their proposal.\"]", "Date": "20150902", "Title": "[McCain ready for 2016 re-election effort]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/article/McCain-ready-for-2016-re-election-effort-6479677.php", "Author": "[Bob Christie, Associated Press]"}
{"Content": "[ Caption, Close, As U.S. policy toward Cuba softens, myriad changes are taking place across the island nation. More than 50 years ago, before Fidel Castro took power, Cuba was a playground for American tourists. , FILE - In this Jan. 19, 2015 file photo, a Cuban and American flag wave from the balcony of the Hotel Saratoga in Havana. President Barack Obama will announce July 1 that the U.S. and Cuba have reached an agreement to open embassies in Havana and Washington, a senior administration official said.  (AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa, File), Steadily, wealth appears to be growing in Cuba, and smart phones are proliferating. , As we rode around Havana in late May with a Cuban friend, his excitement was palpable. , He had recently opened a highly successful paladar, or restaurant, was driving around in a shiny new car, constantly fielding calls on his cell phone and talking nonstop about starting more businesses in the crumbling, but still beautiful Cuban capital. , \"Things are changing,\" he said. \"There is still much that needs to be done, but things are changing.\", It was easy to see why he thought so. My wife, Elena, and I were impressed by his material goods, his entrepreneurial spirit and his paladar, which had an American feel and a clientele that was primarily Cuban, but surprisingly affluent. , Like our friend, some had cars, fashionable clothes and - always - a nice cell phone. By our standards, his prices were low, but paying the equivalent of $2 or $3 for a sandwich is a lot in a country where the average monthly salary is $20. , It was clear that economic reforms begun by President Ral Castro in 2008 have had an effect. Without overstating it, there is more money around than when we lived in Havana from 2008 to 2013. , Cubans can buy and sell homes and cars now and, due to revised U.S. regulations, get more remittances from friends and relatives in America. , Both have generated cash and commerce, but the larger change has been the encouragement of private business by the Communist government, including the paladares and \"casas particulares,\" or bed and breakfasts, sprouting up everywhere. , There are now more than 500,000 people on the island licensed for self-employment, or what Cuba calls \"cuentapropismo,\" versus 157,000 people five years ago. , So things are changing, but it is still Cuba, which means most of the countrys 11 million people have little money, work for the government, live in downtrodden circumstances and exist in a time warp going back to 1959, the year Fidel Castro took power. , It also means that if youve got your own business, youve got to deal daily with inefficiency, spotty supplies and excessive taxation and regulation. The latter is official policy - the Communist government wants private enterprise, but it doesnt want too much individual wealth or income disparity. , Our friend, who asked not to be identified, said he often spends his entire day going to markets seeking food for his menu. , He must comply with a stack of regulations that require endless paperwork and, worse, his business is examined by numerous inspectors who often demand a bribe. , There are also nuisances like regular blackouts, which according to Jorge Pion, a Cuban oil expert at the University of Texas at Austin, are the indirect result of increased electricity demand from the many new businesses. , Cuba cant afford to buy more oil, so \"they control energy demand by purposely switching the power off,\" he said. , Of course, our main topic of conversation with everyone was the U.S.-Cuba rapprochement. , I found Cubans reserved about their expectations, but happy in the belief that the old Cold War impasse was ending and their lives would improve as a result. And despite years of anti-American propaganda, they like America and Americans. , \"We are waiting for the Americans to come. We hope there is an avalanche of them,\" a casa particular owner told me. , We had heard Cuba is now packed with Americans, which wasnt quite true, but there are definitely many more. They were a rare sight when we lived there, but this time we saw them everywhere, piling in and out of tour buses. , The last Cuban government figures showed 92,000 Americans visitors in 2013, not including approximately 350,000 Cuban Americans who the government considers nationals. It is estimated there are 20 percent more Americans this year. , Some of them are among a wave of foreigners pouring in looking for business opportunities. On our first night in town, we met an Estonian woman searching for a 30-room mansion to convert into a boutique hotel and spa aimed at Americans. , It all reminded me of a conversation I had in 2006 with a British diplomat in Havana who said he paid little attention to the then-endless U.S.-Cuba sparring. , \"My opinion is that its all meaningless because in 25 years Cuba will be an American playground again,\" he said, referring to how the island was before Fidel Castro took power. , He should be right. Cuba is a beautiful tropical island just 90 miles from Florida, and therefore a natural destination for American tourists. President Obamas announcement Wednesday that the U.S. and Cuba will re-establish diplomatic relations for the first time in 54 years was a key first step. , But whether full normalization comes - this will require that the U.S. end the trade embargo - likely depends primarily on who wins the next presidential election. I would just say this: The old policy of isolation and embargo accomplished nothing except to deeply entrench the current Cuban government. , The new policy holds the possibility for change in a way the old one never could. There should be no turning back. , , Franks, a Houston resident, was bureau chief for Reuters from 2008 to 2013.]", "Date": "20150703", "Title": "[Franks: New scenes in Cuba hint at what could be]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Franks-New-scenes-in-Cuba-hint-at-what-could-be-6365755.php", "Author": "[By Jeff Franks]"}

The decision will force city council to consider a repeal, or place the issue on the ballot in November. , On the heels of a Texas Supreme Court ruling that the city must repeal its equal rights ordinance or place it on the November ballot, conservative opponents again sued Mayor Annise Parker on Monday, this time seeking unspecified legal fees and damages for allegedly impeding citizens right to vote, among other charges. , The Houston Area Pastor Council is suing the mayor for legal fees and damages associated with a lawsuit filed last summer. At issue in the equal rights ordinance case was not the law itself, but whether opponents submitted a repeal referendum petition last summer with the needed 17,269 valid signatures. , The city said the petition was riddled with forgery and errors, and rejected it on those grounds. Opponents, largely conservative activists, said the city sought and falsely found problems with the petition. A district judge eventually ruled that the plaintiffs were 565 signatures shy of clearing the threshold. , But last month, the Texas Supreme Court reversed that ruling and ordered the city to either repeal the ordinance or send it to voters. If the equal rights ordinance lands on the November ballot, it could drive turnout in what is usually a low turnout election. , Attorney Andy Taylor would not specify an amount at a press conference Monday morning, but said the legal work associated with case was close to $500,000. The suit has been filed in Harris County district court. , The citys equal right ordinance bans discrimination based not just on sexual orientation and gender identity but also, as federal laws do, sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status. , \"She trampled the voting rights of over a million people in the fourth largest city in the United States of America,\" Taylor said. \"And so were here today to say uh uh, theres going to be accountability for doing that. We are not going to sit idly by and let you do that.\", The second party in the lawsuit is seeking likely much smaller damages for an incident last fall when, as part of a broader discovery phase, the city issued subpoenas to five local pastors that included a demand for their sermons. , Parker quickly called the subpoenas overly broad and eventually withdrew them amid national backlash, particularly from Christian conservatives and Republican politicians, who blasted the city for trying to silence the church. Taylor said the move infringed on the five pastors religious liberty. Three of them, Hernan Castano, Magda Hermida and Khanh Huynh, are listed as plaintiffs in the suit. , A request for comment from Parker was not immediately returned Monday morning.]", "Date": "20150803", "Title": "[HERO opponents sue mayor over court costs, sermon subpoenas]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/houston/article/HERO-opponents-sue-mayor-over-court-costs-sermon-6421825.php", "Author": "[By Katherine Driessen]"}
{"Content": "[ Caption, Close, Attorney Andy Taylor takes the podium to applause from supporters during a press conference celebrating the Texas Supreme Courts suspension of the HERO ordinance Friday, July 24, 2015, in Houston. The decision will force city council to consider a repeal, or place the issue on the ballot in November. ( Jon Shapley / Houston Chronicle ), Last week the Texas Supreme Court stood up and took a strong position against discrimination - specifically, the court refused to discriminate between valid and invalid signatures. , In an 8-0 order, the statewide elected judges held that Houston City Council had to recognize a petition to repeal the citys equal rights ordinance. It doesnt matter that then-City Attorney David Feldman found the petitioners collected too many flawed signatures to reach the necessary threshold. Nor does it matter that a state district judge similarly discovered fatal errors in the repeal attempt. Our state Supreme Court leapfrogged the usual appeals process and instead focused on the fact that City Secretary Anna Russell said that enough signatures were collected before the city attorney argued otherwise. Once she certified it, the court wrote, City Council had a duty to follow through on the referendum. Now City Council has to choose its next step: either put the ordinance on the November ballot or repeal it. , It is tempting to simply repeal the ordinance for the time being and take it up again after Election Day under a new mayor and new city council. Asking for a public vote on Houstons nondiscrimination ordinance risks subjecting immutable human dignity to a popularity contest. Houstonians who look to City Hall to prevent public discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, or family, marital or military status, deserve something greater than a rushed campaign. True liberty means more than fifty percent plus one, and civil rights cannot be doled out at the ballot box. , But a campaign may be the only way to win. Theres no reason to think that the people who oppose the ordinance now will have a change of heart in a few months. Whether the law is passed under Mayor Annise Parker or some future politician, there will be people who believe that businesses should be allowed discriminate on the basis of peoples immutable characteristics. , Without this ordinance, Houstonians kicked out of a bar for the color of their skin will have to make a federal case to find justice. Veterans will get little help at City Hall if theyre booted by a coffee shop because of their service dog. Members of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community will have scant legal recourse beyond a social media campaign. And that is just how some people want it - often people from outside city limits, judging by referendum signatures. , Thats not the Houston we know. Houston is a place that draws strength from its diversity, and City Hall must have laws to protect that diversity. Municipal elections are just a few months away, and voters have already started to contemplate what the future of their city will look like. That should be a future where Houston doesnt risk losing the Super Bowl because of our discriminatory policies. , Just a week ago it seemed like the mayors race would be about potholes and pensions, with the citys revenue cap as the most likely referendum item. Now were back to refighting an issue thats dogged local politics for decades. It is time to finally put it to sleep, and if punching a ballot is the only way to show that Houston is a place that doesnt discriminate, then let the block-walking begin. ]", "Date": "20150728", "Title": "[Equal rights and true liberty]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/editorials/article/Equal-rights-and-true-liberty-6411109.php", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[ Caption, Close, Baby Iris was born with hearing loss and requires hearing aids. Who would consider the $6,000 devices a luxury?, Updated resolutions are placed on empty desks in the House. , Its a particularly stressful time at work. A major deadline is looming, youre drowning in piles of paperwork and lots of people are paying attention. You have every intention of finishing the job you were hired to do - you know that people are counting on you. But between an inability of the team to effectively collaborate and the sheer power of time, the work just doesnt get done. So, when the clock strikes midnight, you get up from your desk, throw all of the unfinished work in the trash and go on a two-year hiatus. , This is how the Texas Legislature works. Or doesnt. , Democrats try to block Republicans from getting what they want, Republicans try to block Democrats from getting what they want, and in the end, Texans get little of what they need. Sandwiched between the big, divisive, hot-button, political issues are lots of little bills that could actually do some good - that could actually help people. These are the bills that get lost in the mix, bills that never get the chance to be heard, bills that die on the floor of the Texas House and Senate. , For our family, it was the Hearing Aid for Children Coverage Act, or HB 2979, that would have required insurance companies to cover the cost of hearing aids for children under the age of 18. They are currently considered \"cosmetic\" - not medically necessary and, therefore, not covered by health insurance - and cost approximately $6,000 out of pocket every three to five years. In many cases, hearing loss is genetic, so many families have multiple children in hearing aids. The financial burden is heavy. , For the parent of a child with hearing loss, this $6,000 bill is not optional. All the medical experts agree that with early intervention - namely, hearing aids and speech therapy - a child with hearing loss has the opportunity to live a life no different than a typical hearing child. My daughter, Iris, is living proof. Thanks to two separate grants from The Center for Hearing and Speech, Iris started speech therapy as a five week-old newborn and was fitted for her first pair of hearing aids at the age of six weeks. Now, at 16 months, she is a curious, lively and extremely talkative little person. We credit her success first and foremost with her ability to hear. How could hearing possibly be considered a luxury for those who can afford it?, Everyone seems to agree that this notion is nonsensical and counterintuitive. Because hearing loss is relatively rare, affecting only two to three babies out of every 1,000, most people simply dont realize that insurance companies in Texas arent required to pay for hearing aids. They just assume they do. Twenty states have passed legislation requiring insurance companies to cover them. Texas should join them, and thats the fight we were waging in Austin. , Most of the representatives and legislative aides with whom I made contact in recent weeks agreed that the bill was \"good.\" Houston representative Sarah Davis, a Republican, was particularly supportive and encouraging. Unfortunately, the goodness (or badness) of a bill has very little to do with whether or not it gets passed. , The Texas Academy of Audiology, which sponsored our bill, tried to pass a similar bill during the 2013 legislative session. It never made it past the Insurance Committee, which is the first step of this process. In order to build momentum and ensure that the bill would make it to the House for a vote this time around, a motivated group of parents made it our mission to spread awareness about the bill via social media, online petitions and various other media outlets. Family and friends near and far started calling and writing their representatives on our behalf, and it actually seemed to make an impact. We got word at nearly midnight on Monday, May 11, that the Insurance Committee unanimously voted to push the bill through to the next critical step of the legislative process: the Calendars Committee. , Calendars would prove to be a huge hurdle - this is where many bills go to die. However, supporters told us that if we had the votes in the Insurance Committee, we would most likely have support in the House. They tend to follow suit, especially when theres virtually no opposition to a bill. While reassuring, we were aware of the time crunch. With the deadline looming for House action on bills that were generated in that chamber, if it didnt pass, we would have to wait another two years to try again. , The reality of how laws are made came into stark relief: These small committees - specifically, the chairs of these small committees - have far more to do with the fate of a bill than the makeup of the legislative chambers or who is governor. Everyone puts stock in the big elections for president or governor, but local elections are where the real power lies. Its a shame that no one really shows up for those. All the phone calls in the world dont stand a chance if the chairman of the Calendars Committee - for the 84th Legislature it was Todd Hunter, a Corpus Christi Republican - doesnt deem it worthy to set on the House calendar. The Calendars chairman has an extraordinary and shocking amount of power. , We found out on Tuesday night, May 12, that our bill had been officially set on the House Calendar for Thursday, the last possible day for votes on House-generated bills. I felt like wed won the lottery - it was that exciting. I remember saying to my husband, \"This is going to happen!\", In hindsight, this was incredibly naive. On average, I hear it takes six years - three legislative sessions - to pass a bill, and now I see why. The calendar is unreliable. Bills that arent heard on their scheduled day just keep getting pushed back to the following day and piling up. Getting onto the House calendar the last day essentially means youre not on the calendar. , Thursday morning, May 14, the lobbyist we were working with emailed with the news that there were 290 bills on the calendar for the day, and ours was 264th on the list. One of the legislative aides who had been keeping me in the loop said it would take a miracle for the House to get to our bill before midnight and that there was absolutely nothing we could do about it. Calling, emailing, showing up at the Capitol in person - nothing would make a difference at this point. We werent up against people; we were up against the clock. , I stopped watching the live stream around 9 p.m. that Thursday night. By this point, the House was still hearing \"overflow\" bills from the day before and hadnt even gotten to those that were originally scheduled for Thursday. It was a loss and a real shame, but certainly not a defeat. , Maybe Im still naive; maybe I just care deeply about my kid and others like her. Either way, we plan to start the process all over again in January 2017 when the House reconvenes. Until then, I will show up at the polls to vote for my local representatives and urge others to do the same. Our parent group plans to take the next two years to regroup, spread awareness and find a Senate companion for the bill. Hopefully, third times a charm. , In the meantime, as the Legislature prepares to adjourn tomorrow, we are left wondering: What kind of state government takes six years to pass a law that would require insurance companies to pay for kids hearing aids? , Ours. , , Wittels is a Houston resident.]", "Date": "20150601", "Title": "[Wachs: Texas Legislature puts process, politics ahead of kids' needs]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Wittels-Texas-Legislature-puts-process-politics-6295733.php", "Author": "[By Stephanie Wittels Wachs]"}

No, we mean that another presidential contender, by declaring, has gone and entered the cartoonists den. , Now visual satirists, they dont approach the whole business of American democracy in action quite like normal folk.

From toupeed head to toe, who embodies the most delicious smorgasbord of richly exaggerated features?, Well, with that very puzzler in mind, I approached nine of the nations top political cartoonists, both liberal and conservative, to ask: Who from among the electoral hordes is your favorite current presidential candidate to draw?, How they answered:, Nate Beeler (Columbus Dispatch):, As of now, Ive only drawn a handful of the candidates. The one Ive tackled the most is Hillary Clinton, but Im not super-happy with my version of her. Of the Republicans, I think Ted Cruz is the most fun to draw because his features are so interesting-looking. , He reminds me of the silent-movie stars. Cant you just picture him in black and white, either as a swashbuckling hero come to save Washington, or a black-clothed villain tying an Obamacare maiden to the train tracks? Im eager to draw him and Rand Pauls curls as we get closer to 2016. , The one possible GOP contender who gives me fits is the guy Ive drawn the most: Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Theres something about his face that throws me every time I sit down at the drawing board. I usually blame it on the fact that he lacks eyebrows. , Steve Breen (San Diego Union-Tribune):, It has to be Donald Trump. I love going after him. I know hes an easy target, but he has such a nice, puffy face and weird head of hair. Plus, a cartoonist is inexorably drawn to Trumps bombastic arrogance like a lecherous multi-millionaire is attracted to a young, Slavic model. , Kevin \"Kal\" Kallaugher (The Economist and the Baltimore Sun):, Christie is among the most interesting to engage as a caricature because his body is an essential feature of his recognition. It is hard to utilize the typical Big Head/Little Body equation that is conventional in cartoons because his body shape makes his head look small. He has been grappling with a weight problem for some time, and it would be an easy target for cartoonists to poison his portrait with a little padding around the waist. The challenge for me is to create an effective caricature that doesnt appear to be gratuitously adding pounds, but instead accentuates the total shape of his head/body combination. , Mike Luckovich (Atlanta Journal Constitution):, Of all the clowns in the Republican clown car, my favorites Jeb. Theres an arrogance about him, and its funny when hes asked questions he shouldve seen coming and stumbles over them. With Jindal, Cruz, Christie, Huckabee and Jeb, to name but a few, this group is like something \"Saturday Night Live\" dreamed up. , Jimmy Margulies (The Record):, Since I have been drawing cartoons of Chris Christie as New Jersey governor since he took office, I would have to go with him as a favorite. He has been running for president almost from the day he first took office, even if he declined to get into the race in 2012. , His at-times intemperate outbursts  as well as policy decisions that have been both self-serving towards his candidacy, as well as highly questionable in terms of what is best for New Jersey  have made him, as one observer characterized it: \"The gift that keeps on giving.\", I dont know how successful he will be as a candidate this time, but according to his announcement speech, he promises to be outspoken and hold little back, so it is likely he will generate some controversy that becomes good cartoon fodder for New Jersey audiences, and possibly national ones, as well. , Scott Stantis (Chicago Tribune):, I have been drawing Hillary and her ever-changing hair for 20 years, so there is some comfort in familiarity there. Christie is a big bucket of goo, and thats always fun, but my favorite so far is Ted Cruz. He looks a lot like Joe McCarthy. Heavy brows and narrow eyes. A pointed nose and a lipless mouth. Add a five oclock shadow and there he is. , Signe Wilkinson (Philly.com):, I like them all except for Lindsey Graham, who  like so many nice-looking, pale-haired, middle-aged white men  has no discernible features. [I] adore Ted Cruzs glass jaw. , Matt Wuerker (Politico):, The start of a campaign puts a cartoonist in that awkward spot of having to choose between whats best for the country and whats best for satire. Whats good for us political satirists certainly isnt necessarily good for the rest of the world. I believe the German word for this is \"schadenweldenfreude.\" For us, its the loonier the better, so its hard to beat Donald Trump when it comes to being the ideal generator of juicy political bombast and ready-made political satire. And then, of course, theres his hair. , Adam Zyglis (Buffalo News):, I would say the larger-than-life Christie takes the cake  no pun intended. He has a Mafioso quality that makes it incredibly fun to draw. His physical size, distinctive features and strong personality lend well to caricature, to say the least. The fact that hes a more legitimate candidate makes him a more important target than Trump, in my opinion. , Trump comes in at a close second, and its 100 percent because of the hair, of course. If you can imagine the Donald with a generic hairdo, he would be infinitely less interesting to draw. That said, his egoism and outrageous comments have been a magnet to satirists.

(AP)  Most of Missouris potential Republican candidates for governor expressed opposition Thursday to raising taxes for transportation funding, as they gathered under the same tent with other politicians to shake hands with voters at the Missouri State Fair. , The annual Governors Ham Breakfast offered a rare opportunity for people to mingle with five Republicans and a Democrat expected to run for the states top office  possibly the last time theyll all be in one spot before the August 2016 primary elections. , So far, four Republicans have officially announced their candidacies: former state Rep. Randy Asbury, state Sen. Bob Dixon, former House speaker and U.S. attorney Catherine Hanaway and Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder. Suburban St. Louis businessman John Brunner also is expected to join the race. , The ham-and-eggs breakfast is a mainstay in Missouri politics, making the absence of former Navy SEAL Eric Greitens, who is expected to announce plans to run as a Republican, unusual. Greitens has never before run for elected office and has touted himself as a political outsider. , Republican gubernatorial candidates told The Associated Press on Thursday that in general they oppose proposals to raise the gas or cigarette taxes to pay for road and bridge repairs. Kinder even said its important to \"try to at all costs to avoid raising taxes.\", Some lawmakers and interest groups have suggested raising the gas and cigarette taxes as transportation officials warn about a strained budget they say is forcing them to take a triage approach to maintenance. , Most GOP candidates said the current transportation budget should be reviewed to ensure money is being spent efficiently. Hanaway said shes taken a no-tax pledge but that issuing bonds would be a likely solution. , The Republicans push to try to make use of existing state money to pay for the roads stands in opposition to Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon. He floated ideas for a gas tax or to institute tolls on Interstate 70 during his State of the State address in January. He later backed a failed Senate measure this year that would have increased the diesel fuel tax by 3.5 cents and the gas tax by 1.5 cents.

Clinton is making the case for the international agreement to curb Irans nuclear ambitions as Congress opens debate on the accord. , WASHINGTON (AP)  Hillary Rodham Clinton issued a hardline warning to Iran on Wednesday that as president she would \"not hesitate\" to take military action to stop the country from acquiring nuclear weapons. , Casting herself as a key player in talks that led to the landmark agreement to control Irans nuclear program, Clinton praised the accord as part of a larger Middle East strategy even as she stressed that it is not a step toward normalizing relations. , \"We should anticipate that Iran will test the next president,\" she told a Washington think-tank. \"Theyll want to see how far they can bend the rules.\", The Democratic presidential contender and former secretary of state said: \"That wont work if Im in the White House. Ill hold the line against Iranian noncompliance.\", She coupled her remarks about the Iran deal with a call to convene an emergency gathering at the United Nations to tackle the crisis of Syrian and other refugees flooding Europe. She said the crisis is a \"global responsibility,\" the U.S. should lead the effort and countries at the conference could pledge to accept migrants or donate aid money. , Clinton spoke as Congress prepared to open debate Wednesday on the deal. Democrats have clinched the votes needed to block passage of a disapproval resolution against the accord, a win for the White House against united Republican opposition. , But much of the responsibility for enacting the agreement will fall on the next administration, making the issue likely to linger in the presidential campaign. The deal would require Iran to limit its nuclear program for at least a decade in exchange for billions of dollars in relief from international sanctions. , Republicans are seizing on opposition to the deal among much of Congress and many American Jews to criticize Clinton, frequently casting the agreement as a plank of an \"Obama-Clinton foreign policy.\" A new Pew survey released on Tuesday found that just 21 percent of Americans approved of the deal  a 12-point drop since mid-July. , In her remarks, Clinton attempted to reassure skeptics by threatening serious penalties for violations, including possible military action. She offered strong support for Israel, whose leaders strongly oppose the agreement, promising that if elected she would invite the countrys prime minister to the White House during her first month in office. , \"The Iranians and the world need to understand that we will act decisively if we need to,\" she said. \"As president, I will take whatever actions are necessary to protect the United States and its allies.\", But even as she offered a stern warning to Iran, she stressed that rejecting the deal would lead to international isolation for the U.S. , \"Several Republicans boast theyll tear up this agreement in 2017,\" she said. \"Thats not leadership, thats recklessness.\", Instead, she proposed measures to halt Irans support for terrorist groups and other bad behavior in the region. , Clinton called for expanding the U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf and increasing support to Israel and other allies in the region. She also proposed building a coalition to crack down on weapons shipments to Hamas and to counter terrorist organizations financed by Iran, such as Hezbollah. , Another goal: Press countries in the region to block ships and aircraft of Irans elite military unit, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, from entering their territory. , As secretary of state, Clinton helped facilitate the talks that eventually led to the nuclear deal. She sent a top adviser to participate in secret meetings with Iran through the sultan of Oman that started the international negotiations. , Since then, shes largely backed the negotiations, staying current with the talks with regular briefings from administration officials, according to aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they werent authorized to discuss private meetings publicly. , Clintons current support for the deal marks a striking role reversal for the second-time presidential candidate and her long-ago rival. In 2008, she called Barack Obamas offer to meet Irans leader without preconditions \"irresponsible and, frankly, naive.\" And when Clinton said she would \"obliterate\" Iran if the country used nuclear weapons against Israel, Obama likened her \"bluster\" to the \"tough talk\" of then-President George W. Bush. , More recently, shes wondered publicly whether a deal would ever take shape. Clinton told an American Jewish organization last year that she was \"skeptical the Iranians will follow through and deliver.\" She said she had \"seen many false hopes dashed through the years.\", ", "Date": "20150912", "Title": "[Clinton threatens military action if Iran breaks deal]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Clinton-seeks-to-reassure-Iran-deal-skeptics-with-6492633.php", "Author": "[Lisa Lerer and Ken Thomas, Associated Press]"}

(AP)  Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders touted his progressive credentials before his largest crowd to date Wednesday night as he pushed his campaign into Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walkers backyard. , Sanders packed the Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Madison, filling its 10,000 seats to show his bid to snatch the Democratic nomination from front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton isnt a longshot after all. , \"Tonight we have made a little bit of history,\" the white-haired Sanders said at a podium positioned between Wisconsin and United States flags at the outset of his hourlong speech before a boisterous crowd. \"Tonight, we have more people at any meeting for a candidate of president of the United States than any other candidate.\", Sanders, a 73-year-old self-described democratic socialist, is trying to appeal to the most liberal Democrats with his message of raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, bridging the gap between rich and poor, criminal justice reform and raising taxes on the wealthy and Wall Street. , The message resonated in Madison, the states reliably liberal capital and home to the University of Wisconsin. And it stood as a sharp contrast to Wisconsins own conservative White House hopeful Walker, who is preparing to enter the crowded field of GOP candidates. The governor is expected to make his announcement on or shortly after July 13. , Sanders immediately went after Republicans and Walker, who made his name restricting collective bargaining rights for public workers. , \"When you deny the right of workers to come together in collective bargaining, thats extremism,\" Sanders said to rousing cheers. \"When you tell a woman that she cannot control her own body, thats extremism.\", Walker, whom the crowd loudly booed whenever Sanders mentioned his name, criticized Sanders in a statement issued Wednesday in advance of the speech. , \"Bernie Sanders is right about one thing: We dont need another Clinton in the White House,\" Walker said. \"On virtually every other issue, however, he stands in stark opposition to most Americans. Wisconsinites have rejected his top-down, government-knows-best approach three times in the last four years.\", Walkers statement is a reference to his three election victories since 2010. He won election, defeated a recall in 2012 and then won re-election. His victories have helped fuel his all-but-certain run for the White House. , Sanders has built his underdog campaign to succeed President Barack Obama on blunt talk about the economy. In addition to advocating a $15-an-hour minimum wage and raising taxes on the rich, he also supports a massive government-led jobs program to fix roads and bridges, a single-payer health care system, an expansion of Social Security benefits and debt-free college. , \"The big money interests  Wall Street, corporate America, all of these guys   have so much power that no president can defeat them unless there is an organized grassroots movement making them an offer they cant refuse,\" Sanders said. , The message resonated with the welcoming crowd, many of whom gathered at the state Capitol four years ago to protest against Walker and his move against unions. , \"Hes reminiscent of Obama in that he breaks the mold of what weve seen election after election with presidential candidates,\" said Savannah Kramas, a 26-year-old health care worker from Mosinee.

Stern School of Business in New York. Clinton says businesses need to \"break free from the tyranny of todays earnings report\" so they can take a more long-term view of the economy. , Hillary Clinton urged the State Department to release her emails as quickly as possible. , WASHINGTON (AP)  A new letter by intelligence investigators to the Justice Department says secret government information may have been compromised in Hillary Rodham Clintons private server, underscoring an inescapable reality for her presidential campaign: Email is forever. , Clinton, the former secretary of state and now the leading Democratic presidential candidate, wants to focus on the economic issues she and her team believe will drive the next election. But they remain unable to fully escape the swirling questions surrounding her decision to run her State Department correspondence through an unsecured system set up at her New York home. , The inspector general of the U.S. intelligence community recently alerted the Justice Department to the potential compromise of classified information arising from Clintons server. The IG also sent a memo to members of Congress that he had identified \"potentially hundreds of classified emails\" among the 30,000 that Clinton had provided to the State Department  a concern the office said it raised with FBI counterintelligence officials. , Though the referral to the Justice Department does not seek a criminal probe and does not specifically target Clinton, the latest steps by government investigators will further fuel the partisan furor surrounding the 55,000 pages of emails already under review by the State Department. , A statement from the intelligence inspector general, I. Charles McCullough, and his counterpart at the State Department, Steve Linick, said that McCulloughs office found four emails containing classified information in a limited sample of 40 emails. , \"This classified information should have never been transmitted via an unclassified personal system,\" they said. , For Clinton, the news amounted to a major distraction on a day when shed hoped to focus on unveiling a new set of economic policies. Instead, she opened her New York City speech by addressing the controversy, decrying some reports as inaccurate. , Some media initially reported that Justice Department had been asked to consider a criminal investigation into whether she mishandled her emails. , \"We are all accountable to the American people to get the facts right, and I will do my part but Im also going to stay focused on the issues,\" she said. , It was not immediately clear whether the Justice Department would investigate the potential compromise highlighted by the intelligence inspector general. The office has not suggested any wrongdoing by Clinton, according to U.S. officials speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the referral publicly. , But the inspector generals office said in its letter to Congressional oversight committees that it was concerned that \"these emails exist on at least one private server and thumb drive with classified information and those are not in the governments possession,\" said Andrea Williams, a spokeswoman for McCullough. , None of the emails were marked as classified at the time they were sent or received, but some should have been handled as such and sent on a secure computer network, said the letter sent to congressional oversight committees. , Clinton has maintained that she never sent classified information on her personal email account, which she said in March she used as a matter of convenience to limit her number of electronic devices. , The State Department has made public some of the emails involving Clinton, and is under court order to make regular further releases of such correspondence. , The aim is for the department to unveil all of 55,000 pages of the emails she turned over by Jan. 29, 2016. But a federal judge this month chastised the department for moving too slowly in providing The Associated Press with thousands of emails submitted through the Freedom of Information Act. , Republicans are pushing Clinton to turn over her server to a third party for a forensic evaluation. , \"Her poor judgment has undermined our national security, and it is time for her to finally do the right thing,\" said House Speaker John Boehner. , Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said she had followed \"appropriate practices in dealing with classified materials.\", But theres little dispute among intelligence officials that Clinton should have been more careful with her information  though her behavior was likely not criminal. , Current and former U.S. intelligence officials say they assume that all of the email that transited Clintons home server is in the possession of Russian or Chinese intelligence services, who would have easily bypassed whatever security measures she took. They, too, spoke on condition of anonymity because they werent authorized to discuss the Clinton email situation publicly. , Whether a security violation or not, the risk for Democrats is that questions about her email harden into an early narrative about Clintons honesty and management skills. Already, Republicans have spent months depicting Clinton as a creature of Washington who flouts the rules for personal gain. , Clintons people say questions about her correspondence wont sway voters, who they argue are more focused on economic and family issues. But, there are signs that the issue may have already affected views of their candidate. , An Associated Press-GfK poll released last week found that voters view her as less decisive and inspiring than when she launched her presidential campaign just three months ago. Just 3 in 10 said the word \"honest\" describes her very or somewhat well. , ", "Date": "20150727", "Title": "[New inquiry into Clinton emails fuels political questions]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/article/Sources-Justice-asked-to-consider-probing-6403175.php", "Author": "[Lisa Lerer and Eric Tucker, Associated Press]"}

And I want people to understand, if you just focus on maybe the biggest showman on the stage, you lose the thread here,\" Clinton said. , \"Well let the Republicans go back and forth with each other, but I want to point out, theres really not that much difference in the policies they are proposing when it comes to women,\" she added. , Republican leaders acknowledged the need to improve the GOPs standing among women, who constituted 53 percent of the national electorate in 2012 and have favored Democrats in every presidential election in the last quarter century. Successful Republican candidates have won only by limiting Democrats advantage with women. , President Barack Obama, for example, won women by 11 percentage points over Republican Mitt Romney in 2012, according to exit polls. The GOPs last successful candidate, President George W. Bush, lost women by just 3 percentage points in 2004. , \"While some people are excited by fat jokes and stupid jokes, I think there are a lot of people in the general election, independents as well as probably many of the women voters, who arent really that entertained by this,\" said GOP presidential candidate Rand Paul, also a Kentucky senator. , Trump may have garnered the most attention, but several Republicans candidates have emphasized priorities that could alienate women in recent weeks, including escalating attacks on Planned Parenthood. Republicans have seized on videos secretly recorded by anti-abortion rights activists that show Planned Parenthood officials clinically describing how they sometimes provide fetal tissue to medical researchers. The organization has said its staff has not engaged in any wrongdoing or agreed to violate any legal or medical standards. , While such criticism is popular among conservative primary voters who are adamantly opposed to abortion, its unclear how the argument will resonate in 2016 with independents and moderates, many women among them, who are likely to decide the general election. , In last weeks debate, Rubio said he had never advocated for bans on abortion that include exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. Polls suggest Rubios position is out of line with the overwhelming majority of voters. , \"This is really good,\" Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said after watching Rubios response. , Heading into 2016, GOP officials hoped to feature women in prominent positions, in line with recommendations from a post-election report compiled by the Republican National Committee after Romneys loss to Obama. , Yet the GOPs only female presidential candidate, former technology executive Carly Fiorina, did not qualify for the partys prime-time debate last week. , Democrats, of course, feature Clinton, who aims to be the first nations first female president. , \"Our party has some work to do,\" said Katie Packer Gage, a former Romney aide who leads a political firm that helps Republicans connect with women. , On Trump, she said, \"most people do see him as a bit of a sexist and misogynist\" but that most of the Republican candidates \"are trying to figure it out\" relative to connecting with women. , Trump tried to turn the tables during a Tuesday interview on CNN, charging that hed address womens health issues better than his Republican rivals. , While he opposes abortion rights, Trump favors exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. He added that Bush should apologize to women for last weeks criticism of the cost of womens health care. Bush said shortly after the comment that he \"misspoke.\", \"I will be so good to women,\" Trump said. \"I cherish women.\", ", "Date": "20150812", "Title": "[Trump bombast overshadows GOP challenges with women]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Trump-bombast-overshadows-GOP-challenges-with-6438206.php", "Author": "[Steve Peoples and Lisa Lerer, Associated Press]"}

Bushs no. 2 man was initially opposed to gays in the military, but changed his tune nearly a decade later. \"With the respect to the question of relationships, my general view is freedom means freedom for everyone,\" he told the Associated Press. His lesbian daughter almost certainly played a role in evolving his views. Hes still one of the few prominent Republicans to support extending gay marriage rights. , Al GoreFor a good length of time, the former vice president supported the concept of same-sex unions but not same-sex marriages. \"Im for domestic partnerships having legal protections, but not the same sacrament, not the same name, because I favor protecting the institution of marriage as it has been understood between a man and a woman,\" he said during a debate at Dartmouth College in 1999. But in 2008, Gore switched his tune when he outright said \"gay men and women ought to have the same rights as heterosexual men and women ... to join together in marriage, and I dont understand why it is considered by some people to be a threat to heterosexual marriage.\", Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.In 1996, Leahy voted YES on the Defense of Marriage Act, prohibiting same-sex marriage. Leahy later expressed regret on his decision, saying \"When I voted for DOMA in 1996, I believed that it was a way to allow states to maintain their independence and define marriage as each state saw fit.\" , Laura BushThe former First Ladys stance on same-sex marriage and abortion was a bit different than her husbands, according to her memoir \"Spoken from the Heart.\" In an interview with CNNs Larry King in 2010, Bush said, \"There are a lot of people who have trouble coming to terms with that because they see marriage as traditionally between a man and a woman. But I also know that, you know, when couples are committed to each other and love each other, that they ought to have, I think, the same sort of rights that everyone has.\", Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.Like so many other senators, Murray voted YES on the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, prohibiting same-sex marriage. Murray later changed her stance, and in 2011 stated that she was planning to repeal the act entirely. It was noted that Murray never offered an explanation on why she voted for DOMA in the first place. , John KerryStrangely, Kerry voted NO on the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, but would later say states should be able to decide if they would allow same-sex marriages during his presidential campaign. In 2004, he went on record saying that while he supported same-sex unions, he believed marriage was between a man and a women. In 2011, Kerry quietly came out in support of same-sex marriage to the Boston Globe in an editorial. , Bill ClintonThe former Arkansas governor and U.S. president unceremoniously signed the Defense of Marriage Act into law in 1996 despite calling it \"gay-baiting.\" Years later, he said the law should be overturned, though some in the LGBT community are still upset that he signed into being in the first place, the New York Times reported. , Jimmy CarterAfter long supporting same-sex marriage, the former U.S. president confused many following an interview with Dallas WFAA-TV. In that interview, Carter flip-flopped on the issue, saying states, rather than the nation as a whole, should decide on legalizing same-sex marriage. \"I dont think that the government ought to ever tell the church to marry people, if the church doesnt want to ... Im kind of inclined to let the states decide individually.\", Vice President Joe BidenPrior to angering President Barack Obamas campaign staff in 2012 by openly supporting same-sex marriage, Biden issued support for same-sex civil unions but not marriage during a debate with Sarah Palin in 2008. In 2013, he repeated his support for same-sex marriage in an interview with Rolling Stone Magazine, saying \"Remember, I got criticized for saying I support gay marriage. I just decided I couldnt be quiet about it anymore, and everybody was stunned that thats where the public is. And Im not stunned; its where the publics been for a while. Talk to any of your kids, for Gods sake.\", President Barack ObamaIn 2006, Obama expressed opposition to same-sex marriage, but supported the concept of civil unions, saying churches and faith groups should be able to decide whether to call them marriages or not. In 2013, he regretted his distinction between unions and marriages. \"Ive always believed that gay and lesbian Americans should be treated fairly and equally. I was reluctant to use the term marriage because of the very powerful traditions it evokes. And I thought civil union laws that conferred legal rights upon gay and lesbian couples were a solution ... What Ive come to realize is that for loving, same-sex couples, the denial of marriage equality means that, in their eyes and the eyes of their children, they are still considered less than full citizens.\", Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev.In 1996, Reid voted YES on the Defense of Marriage Act, prohibiting same-sex marriage. His views must have evolved since then because in 2013, following the Supreme Courts ruling to strike down DOMA, he called it a \"great, historic day for equality in America.\"Source: Politico, Jon Huntsman, Jr.Just prior to the 2012 presidential election, Huntsman supported the concept of same-sex unions. A year later, he wrote in an editorial for the American Conservative that he was for same-sex marriage and encouraged others to do so as well. \"While serving as governor of Utah, I pushed for civil unions and expanded reciprocal benefits for gay citizens. I did so not because of political pressure--indeed, at the time 70% of Utahns were opposed--but because as governor my role was to work for everybody, even those who didnt have access to a powerful lobby ... That was 4 years ago. Today we have an opportunity to do more: conservatives should start to lead again and push their states to join the nine others that allow all their citizens to marry.\", Hillary ClintonThe former First Lady expressed support for the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, but supported same-sex civil unions and benefits for same-sex partnerships. In 2014, she claimed to have since evolved her views in support of same-sex marriage. \"I think youre reading it very wrong,\" she told CBS News. \"Just because youre a politician doesnt mean youre not a thinking human being. You gather information, you think through positions, youre not 100 percent set, thank goodness, youre constantly re-evaluating where you stand. That is true for me. One of my big problems right now is that too many people believe they have a direct line to the divine and they never want to change their mind about anything.\", Denton County Judge James DePiazza was on vacation when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled his office had to provide marriage licenses to same sex couples. , That made DePiazza uncomfortable. He didnt believe it was right to marry same sex couples, and his first thought was to stop doing weddings outright to avoid discrimination. But he scrapped that plan and opted to publish a document, signed by brides- and grooms-to-be, acknowledging his opposition gay marriage. , \"Judge DePiazza prefers to NOT conduct same-sex ceremonies, but will not decline anyone who chooses to schedule with him,\" says the form, which bears two blank lines for the couple to sign. \"While we may not necessarily agree with, we acknowledge Judge DePiazzas position that he prefers not to conduct same-sex marriages and agree not to address the topic of same-sex marriages with Judge DePiazza before, during or after the ceremony.\", RELATED:45 gay couples marry in mass Houston wedding, \"During the ceremony the topic is really not up for discussion,\" the judge said in an interview. , DePiazza has been a judge in Precinct 2 of Denton County since 2007. A Catholic and a graduate of San Antonios Wayland Baptist University (as well as the University of North Texas), he said condoning same-sex marriage violated his religious beliefs. But he steered clear of the route briefly advocated by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who said in the days after the court ruling that Texas state employees could claim religious freedom to deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples. , Instead, DePiazza issued the document to make sure everyone knows how he feels about the marriage before he officiates it. , \"Its to let them know where I stand. I would want to know that if I was getting married,\" he said. \"There are some couples of the same sex who dont want to be married by someone who doesnt believe in same sex marriage.\", The document also has couples acknowledge that their ceremony will be \"a brief formal declaration of civil marriage,\" not the traditional marriage. It also prohibits photography of the ceremony, instead saying couples can use the courtroom to take pictures after their ceremony. , \"I decided that for my own privacy,\" DePiazza said. \"Because people take pictures and can doctor them or take little snippets out of video to warp what happened.\", RELATED:Pastor Protection Act seen as posturing for likely legalization of same-sex marriage by SCOTUS, The move has landed DePiazza in some hot water. The Dallas Observer consulted Katherine Franke, director of private rights at Colombia Universitys law school, and reported that the new document probably wouldnt stand up in court, because same sex couples are fully-qualified to receive public benefits of marriage. DePiazzas Facebook page has also attracted some internet rage. , \"You are not fit for public office if you choose to discriminate by making my friend sign a document stating you are performing his marriage even though it is against your personal beliefs. Its your job, and has nothing to do with your personal beliefs,\" wrote one user on DePiazzas profile. \"Its not your marriage and doesnt affect you whatsoever.\", But the judge said he created the document \"out of respect\" for the people he would marry.]", "Date": "20150713", "Title": "[Texas judge asks same sex-couples to sign form acknowledging he disapproves of same-sex marriage]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/texas/article/Texas-judge-asks-same-sex-couples-to-sign-form-6381862.php", "Author": "[Dylan Baddour, Houston Chronicle]"}

{"Content": "[ Caption, Close, Election Clerk Richard DeLosSantos prepares voting booths at the Metropolitan Multi-Services Center, Tuesday, May 27, 2014, in Houston. (Cody Duty / Houston Chronicle), Judging by the headlines, Texans may get the impression that the state attorney generals key duty is to sue the federal government. The real meat and potatoes of the office involves defending the states public information and open meetings statutes and enforcing the collection of child support judgments, in addition to providing legal opinions and representing the state in court. This election will give Texas our first new attorney general in more than a decade, and voters should look for an attorney who will emphasize those core functions of the office. , Democratic candidate Sam Houston is the best choice on the ballot. A graduate of Baylor Law School and candidate for Texas Supreme Court in 2008, Houston is more than just a famous name (though it certainly doesnt hurt). Houston, 51, is board certified in civil trial advocacy and has 26 years experience as a Houston-based litigator, practicing civil law at the state and federal level. With executive experience managing his law firm, Houston will bring the attitude of an attorney over that of a politician. , Meeting with the Houston Chronicle editorial board, Houston said that he would rely more on mediation than politically charged proactive lawsuits. That strategy may not make headlines, but it stands to save taxpayer dollars while getting good results for Texas. , This balanced, professional attitude should help win over some traditionally Republican voters, who find themselves with a troubling candidate. , State Sen. Ken Paxton, R-McKinney, puts forth the persona of a Sunday school teacher but has a history of lawbreaking and questionable business practices that should disqualify him in the minds of Texans. , The most notable scandal involves Paxton directing his law clients to invest with a friends financial services firm, which paid Paxton a 30 percent cut. Not only did the Republican candidate for attorney general violate state law by failing to register with the State Securities Board, but he exploited the trust clients put in him for his own financial gain. Two of those clients went on to sue Paxton for breach of fiduciary duty. , It wasnt just a one-time mistake. Paxton improperly solicited clients in 2004, 2005 and 2012. This habit reveals either a striking disregard for the law or chronic forgetfulness, neither of which are desirable qualities in a candidate for attorney general. , As a result of the State Securities Boards disciplinary order, Paxton had to pay a $1,000 fine. But the ordeal isnt over. Paxton still faces a potential felony charge, which will be settled after the election. Voters shouldnt want a lawyer-in-chief who will confront the wrong end of a grand jury on day one. , It doesnt end there. , Paxtons recent ethics filings have failed to disclose his position on the boards of various nonprofit corporations. And in a circumstance that raises other ethical questions, Paxton was an early investor in a security camera company that went on to land a multi-million-dollar state contract. , However, as the saying goes: It isnt the crime, it is the coverup. Paxton has routinely refused to meet with journalists, political groups and media outlets to answer questions about his history of shady - and illegal - practices. He has cancelled meetings with everyone from tea party groups to this newspaper, hiding from the very people he will be charged with defending, In his campaign, Paxton acts less like a candidate seeking the attorney generals office and more like someone who fears investigation by it. , The attorney generals office is charged with enforcing transparency in government, and Paxtons stonewalling tactics do not bode well for Texas future.]", "Date": "20141010", "Title": "[For attorney general]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/recommendations/article/For-attorney-general-5815181.php", "Author": "[Copyright 2014: Houston Chronicle]"}

Former U.S. Attorney Eldridge announced his bid to unseat Republican U.S. Sen.

(AP)  Former U.S. Attorney Conner Eldridge announced his bid Wednesday to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. John Boozman next year in Arkansas, launching an uphill challenge in a state where Democrats have suffered heavy losses in recent years. , Eldridge, 38, is the first Democratic candidate to announce hes running for Boozmans seat. Boozman, a former congressman, was first elected to the Senate in 2010, and announced last year he would seek a second term in 2016. , \"Washington is broken,\" Eldridge said in a statement released by his campaign. \"Im running for the Senate because Im committed to doing everything I can to fix it for Arkansas and for our country.\", Eldridge is running in a state where Republicans have swept statewide and federal offices in recent elections by tying Democrats to President Barack Obama, who remains deeply unpopular in Arkansas. Boozman defeated two-term Democratic U.S. Sen. Blanche Lincoln in the 2010 election. , Eldridge distanced himself from the president, saying he opposes the Iran nuclear deal backed by the White House. Republicans have criticized the agreement, which aims to curb Irans nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars in relief from international economic sanctions. , \"I think the Iran deal is a bad deal for our country,\" Eldridge told The Associated Press. \"Reaching this deal enables $100 billion or more to go to the largest state sponsor of terrorism. Thats just not a good deal in my opinion.\", Eldridge stopped short of saying whether he would have voted for the presidents health overhaul, but said he opposes attempts to repeal the law and that he would push to improve it. Boozman and the rest of the states all-GOP Republican delegation have called for the laws repeal. , Eldridge stepped down as the U.S. attorney for the western district of Arkansas last month, after widespread speculation he was weighing a Senate bid. Eldridge was nominated by Obama to the post in September 2010, and he was confirmed later that year. , Boozman said he planned to run for re-election after he had emergency heart surgery last year. He reported having more than $872,000 in the bank for his re-election bid last month. , Boozman vowed to continue fighting the presidents \"misguided agenda\" on issues such as illegal immigration and the Iran deal. , \"I am committed to continuing to strongly advocate for Arkansas and I look forward to the campaign next year,\" he said in a statement. , Eldridge didnt mention Boozman in his announcement and declined to say how hed contrast himself with the incumbent senator. , \"Im ready to go to the senate and approach the job of a senator in that nonpartisan, result-driven way that cuts through the partisanship and problems in Washington,\" he told the AP. , Candidates can begin filing paperwork to officially run for office in November. Eldridge is the second Democrat to launch a 2016 bid for federal office in the state. Former Little Rock School Board member Dianne Curry last month announced she was challenging U.S. Rep. French Hill in central Arkansas 2nd District. , State Democrats cheered Eldridges entry in the race, calling him an energetic candidate. , \"Hes a conservative Democrat in a state where most Democrats are conservative Democrats, so I think hes going to do well,\" state Democratic Party spokesman H.L. Moody said. , Republicans were quick to try and cast Eldridge as too closely aligned with the president. , \"Conner Eldridge might want to remove the line about working for President Obama on his resume, because his ties to the unpopular President make him unelectable in Arkansas,\" National Republican Senatorial Committee Communications Director Andrea Bozek said in a statement issued shortly after Eldridges announcement. , ", "Date": "20150909", "Title": "[Ex-prosecutor launches bid to unseat Republican Sen.

Zakaria, who is in her 40s, said she and her family have prayed every day since Carter announced this month that cancer has spread to his brain and forced him to scale back his work. , \"There is no one in my household who does not have the Guinea worm scar and for this reason, every time we think of the work he came to do to free us all from the disease,\" Zakaria said through a translator.  \"He has done a lot of good work and for that, we shall always remember him.\", From its founding, Carter insisted that the humanitarian organization focus on work that others had not or would not tackle, including the Guinea-worm eradication project, which cut the number of cases of the disease from 3.5 million in 1986 to 126 in 2014. , A former president often eager to travel and see the problem first-hand lent immediate credibility. The center is now known worldwide for its work on a number of tropical diseases and as a credible backstop to dictators through election monitoring. , In Nepal, for instance, Carter monitored an election after pro-democracy protests forced King Gyanendra to give up his authoritarian rule in 2006. The Carter Centers staff also opened regional offices and assisted for years with efforts to write a constitution, despite one failed effort and several postponed elections. , \"He was the American leader who always held Nepal close to his heart,\" government minister Narayan Prakash Saud said. \"Both Nepali people and the government will always remember the contributions he made for Nepal. He was the bridge to connect people from Nepal with United States.\", When the opposition Maoist party leaders saw they would lose the 2013 election, Carter quietly convinced them to accept it. , He took a different tactic during the centers first election monitoring trip, to Panama in 1989. Carter discovered that the falsified results would give General Manuel Noriegas candidate the victory. He climbed on a stage and shouted in Spanish: \"Are you honest officials or thieves?\" according to his 2007 book \"Beyond the White House.\", Experts in the field say Carters work put the integrity of elections under a microscope and established election monitoring as a serious and professional industry. , \"President Carters contributions to peace and democracy in the world have been incalculable,\" said Eric Bjornlund, president of Democracy International, an organization that promotes democracy globally. , Carters health has been watched closely since May, when he returned early from his 39th election monitoring trip and the centers 100th. During a follow-up exam, doctors discovered a mass on his liver that was removed in August and determined to be melanoma. , In the meantime, the 90-year-old Carter kept working. In mid-June, he announced receipt of $10 million donation to fight another disease that few are targeting. , River blindness disease can lead to loss of sight, along with a rash or skin discoloration, when biting black flies transmit larvae. Carter offered a glimpse of how intimately he is involved in these projects, easily reciting statistics to reporters and expressing frustration over medication getting stuck in African or Latin American ports. , \"Ive had to go through sometimes three different presidents and get them to call their customs officials to let the medicine go through,\" Carter said, prompting smiles from staffers in the room. , Officials at The Carter Center say they will move forward smoothly thanks to years of preparation. , The centers cash budget is more than $100 million, with 180 staffers and hundreds of experts, Carter wrote in his latest book. The Carter Centers endowment stands at $600 million, and last March trustees voted his grandson, Jason Carter, to become board chairman in November. , \"I have no intention of trying to fill his shoes,\" said Jason Carter, a former Georgia state senator. \"This is his legacy that he has built and I have no intention of trying to be Jimmy Carter to this foundation.\", ", "Date": "20150831", "Title": "[Health, election work elevated Jimmy Carter post-presidency]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/us/article/Health-election-work-elevated-Jimmy-Carter-6473390.php", "Author": "[Kathleen Foody and Francis Kokutse, Associated Press]"}

Underdeveloped party resources such as voter data files could become a serious disadvantage for the eventual nominee, particularly if that person is not front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton, who would enter a general election contest with her own outreach network. , Those fundraising realities are top of mind as Democratic officials, donors and activists meet Thursday through Saturday in Minneapolis. Clinton, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley and former Sen. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island are scheduled to speak to attendees Friday. , Federal Election Commission reports tell a disappointing story for the party: The DNC collected $36.5 million in the first six months of the year and had almost no money in special accounts, including one designated for its convention. It had about $7.6 million in available cash and $6.2 million in debts and loans. , The Republican National Committee, coming out of years in the red, posted $63 million in receipts through June, leaving it with $16.7 million cash on hand and $1.8 million in debts and loans. Party fundraising dominance has flipped: At this point before the 2012 election, the DNC was outpacing the RNC. , Republicans also have been far more active in using the accounts created last year by Congress that enable donors to give at higher levels, investing about eight times what Democrats have. , Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the DNCs chairwoman, said she isnt worried. , \"We are building the organization now to make sure that whoever our ultimate nominee is, they are in the best possible position to win next November,\" she said in a statement, \"and we are confident we will have the resources we need.\", Raymond Buckley, chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, said that while state parties will always want more, hes happy with the investments the national committee has made across the country. , \"A successful 2016 is going to depend on whats on the ground locally,\" he said, adding that the DNCs assistance to state parties, in the form of enhanced voter files and leadership training, is \"light years\" ahead of where it was in previous years. , But the DNCs financial situation has given others pause. The Clinton campaign delayed signing a joint fundraising agreement with the party, in part because of perceived disorganization at the DNC. The next nominee is likely to send a new leadership team to the DNC. , On Thursday, the DNC and Clinton campaign completed their joint fundraising plan. The four other Democratic candidates are still in negotiations with the party officials. Such arrangements are mutually beneficial, enabling the nominee to use the partys resources while helping the DNC raise more money to invest in voter outreach and technology. , The role of the parties has diminished over the past five years as super PACs and nonprofit policy groups that dont reveal their donors have risen to prominence. Unlike candidates and the political parties, those outside groups arent constrained by contribution limits. Donors now have more choices about where to send their money and often see outside groups as a better way to influence elections. , President Barack Obama  the de facto leader of the Democratic Party  has contributed to the array of options. , After his 2012 re-election, his campaign formed a policy shop called Organizing for Action rather than folding back into the Democratic National Committee. That group raised about $5 million in the first six months of the year and has maintained control of a social network and data set on millions of Democrats, making it somewhat of a second DNC. , The DNC recently began using the groups email list  which at one point included 20 million addresses of Obama supporters  and Democratic officials said Thursday that theyve finalized a way to make it \"a key piece of infrastructure\" for the party. , \"President Obama is fully committed to seeing a Democrat elected to the White House in 2016, and hes taking this important step to help make that future a reality,\" Matt Compton, DNCs digital director, said in a statement. , Obama remains a top fundraising draw for the party. He has spoken at 19 DNC fundraisers this year, more than his Republican predecessor George W. Bush did in his seventh year of office. Obama also is on track nearly to match President Bill Clintons prodigious fundraising pace from 1999, when he attended 44 DNC fundraisers. , \"The president is the most effective fundraiser there is,\" said Brendan Doherty, an associate professor at the U.S. Naval Academy, who researches presidential fundraising. \"No one in political life is able to command more donors, and no one can better serve the party.\", The DNC is poised to quicken its fundraising pace. Top party financiers meet Friday in Minneapolis. In late September, the DNC will host an LGBT gala in New York, a major fundraiser. And Democratic presidential debates, which begin in October, also may foster donor interest in the party. , __, Follow Julie Bykowicz on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/bykowicz]", "Date": "20150829", "Title": "[Democratic Party lags in money before presidential year]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Democratic-Party-lags-in-money-before-6469012.php", "Author": "[Julie Bykowicz, Associated Press]"}
{"Content": "[ Caption, Close, FILE - In this July 13, 2015 file photo, Republican presidential candidate, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, speaks in Ames, Iowa. Hillary Rodham Clinton offered a qualified endorsement of the landmark nuclear deal with Iran on Tuesday, underscoring the deeply tangled links between President Barack Obamas foreign policy legacy and the presidential aspirations of his former Secretary of State. \"This isnt diplomacy _ it is appeasement, said Bush, one of the many Republicans who lashed out of the landmark deal. , LAS VEGAS (AP)  The Iran nuclear deal was only a few hours old when Republican White House hopefuls began vowing to overturn it. , The stance may help them score points among the conservatives who dominate the Republican presidential primary electorate, where hostility toward President Barack Obamas foreign policy is a prerequisite. But with few easy alternatives, Tuesdays unanimous opposition among the Republican Partys most ambitious could be far less effective among general election voters in the fall of 2016. , The contrast was clear with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, who quickly embraced the deal publicly and privately in a series of meetings with Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill. In a statement issued Tuesday night, she said the briefings she had received and a review of the documents led her to support the agreement. , \"It can help us prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon,\" she said. \"With vigorous enforcement, unyielding verification and swift consequences for any violations, this agreement can make the United States, Israel and our Arab partners safer.\", At roughly the same time Clinton was on Capitol Hill, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker was predicting that the agreement \"will be remembered as one of Americas worst diplomatic failures.\" Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who, like Walker, has vowed to rescind the agreement should he be elected president, charged that \"this deal undermines our national security.\", The partisan divide reflects voters ambivalence over how to counter Irans nuclear ambitions, experts said. , \"The cognitive dissonance of the American public on this issue  longstanding distrust of Iran balanced by dislike of new Middle Eastern entanglements  means we are not likely to see a lot of candidates gaining traction on Iran,\" said Suzanne Maloney, a former State Department staffer and senior fellow at the Brookings Institute in Washington. \"The Republicans who seem to be eager to use this as a campaign issue are going to have difficulty persuading people there is an alternative that is more viable and has a credible outcome.\", No polls have been conducted since the deal was reached Tuesday, but a new AP-GfK poll suggests that Democrats may struggle to earn the publics trust on the issue. , Before the agreement was announced, 6 in 10 Americans disapproved of Obamas handling of the U.S. relationship with Iran, while just over a third approved. At the same time a slim majority of Americans (51 percent) said the United States should have a diplomatic relationship with Iran, the AP-GfK poll found, slightly more than the 45 percent who said it should not. , And an April AP-GFK poll found 54 percent approved of the framework of the then-unfinished Iran deal. , Republicans are far more likely to oppose the bargain, which was evident as 2016 hopefuls lined up to blast it. , A group supporting Rubio released a television ad touting his opposition in an effort to burnish his conservative credentials. Campaigning in Iowa, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush called Obamas actions \"naive and wrong.\", \"Weve created, legitimized, Iran being a nuclear threshold country, and that in and of itself creates huge instability in the region,\" Bush said. , Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has been skeptical of U.S. intervention in the Middle East, said the deal was \"unacceptable\" and that hed vote against it. \"Better to keep the interim agreement in place instead of accepting a bad deal,\" Paul wrote on Twitter. , The political reasons for Republicans to condemn the bargain were evident in a Las Vegas Harley-Davidson dealership on Tuesday, where Walker made his first appearance after formally launching his White House bid the night before. Robert Fulton, a 68-year-old Vietnam veteran in a dark muscle shirt emblazoned with a skull, vented at the deal. , \"They were talking about fixing a chicken coop and they gave them the whole damn farm,\" Fulton said, holding a can of energy drink. Iran, he added incredulously, \"is the largest exporter of terrorism in the world.\", Walker took the stage and noted that a childhood friend, Kevin Hermening, the youngest of the 52 Americans taken hostage in Iran in 1979, had been a guest at his announcement speech. \"We need a president who will terminate that bad deal with Iran on day one,\" Walker said. \"I will put in place crippling economic sanctions on Iran and I will convince our allies to do the same.\", Neither Walker nor any of his Republican rivals offered clear alternatives to the Iran deal. Yet by condemning the pact, Republicans continue to link Clinton, the former secretary of state, to Obama in an effort to motivate their base and capitalize on voter fatigue after eight years of Democratic occupancy of the White House. , Should the Iran deal pass Congress and no surprises occur, said George Perkovich of the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, it may well become a political wash because the two sides can argue to a stalemate. , \"The Republican is going to say, We cant trust the ayatollahs, Obamas a terrible negotiator,\" Perkovich predicted. \"The Democrat is going to say, Then your choice is another war in the Middle East, only with a country three times the size of Iraq.\", ", "Date": "20150716", "Title": "[GOP candidates slam Iran deal, but will it play in 2016?]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/GOP-candidates-slam-Iran-deal-but-will-it-play-6385312.php", "Author": "[Nicholas Riccardi, Associated Press]"}

The largest Florida corporate donor to a super political committee backing former Gov. Jeb Bushs presidential run is NextEra Energy, the company that owns electric utility giant Florida Power & Light. , WASHINGTON (AP)  The largest Florida corporate donor to a super political action committee backing former Gov. Jeb Bushs presidential run is NextEra Energy Inc. , the company that owns electric utility giant Florida Power & Light. , Bush, a leading Republican contender, knows the company well. In 2009, more than two years after leaving office, he penned an opinion piece in the state capitals newspaper urging regulators to approve the utilitys proposed rate increase for Florida customers. , \"With power, the cash registers open and close,\" Bush wrote in the op-ed, published in the Tallahassee Democrat. FP&L is the states largest electric utility, and NextEra operates in 26 other states and Canada. , Now, NextEra is opening its own coffers to support Right to Rise, the super PAC formed to help Bushs bid for the presidency. The publicly traded, Fortune 200 company contributed more than $1 million to the group this year, according to newly available records  not including cash from its top executive to Bushs campaign. , For Bush, NextEras contributions could raise questions about how the governors past support for the power company factored into its financial support and whether, as president, he would face conflicts should the company undergo federal regulatory scrutiny. , Kristy Campbell, a Bush campaign spokeswoman, denied any conflict of interest in Bushs relationship with NextEra. , \"As evidenced by his strong record in Florida, Gov. Bushs public service was always driven by what was in the best interests of his constituents, nothing else,\" Campbell said. \"As president, he would do the same.\", FP&L did not respond to requests for comment. , Bushs most vocal support for FP&L came in November 2009, as the company sought a rate increase. Writing in the Tallahassee Democrat, Bush said it was the first time in a quarter century the company sought a basic rate increase  and he chided those he viewed as trying to block the raise. , FP&L, he said, would use the rate increase to improve its operations, expand capacity, improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. Another company, Progress Energy, had a similar plan, he wrote. FP&L runs the Turkey Point nuclear plant near Miami. , Bush called out the five-person Public Service Commission that would make the decision, calling the members \"de facto judges,\" and writing: \"Their job is to follow the law, not to impose their personal opinions about the merits of the proposed rate increase.\", In January 2010, the commission approved a basic rate increase for FP&L  a far cry from the record hike it sought. A state official called the decision a win for consumers. Failing to get the larger rate hike, the company said at the time it was halting billions of dollars in projects. , The opinion piece was not the only time Bush supported the industry. In 2008, he wrote an op-ed for the Ocala Star-Banner, headlined: \"Nuclear power: a change for the better,\" and urged approval of three proposed nuclear plants in Florida. , Those plants, and their operators, regularly undergo regulatory scrutiny  an issue that could surface should Bush ultimately win the White House. , NextEras filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission describe some of those regulatory hurdles and their potential effect on the company. It said in December 2014 its business could be hurt by federal or state laws or regulations mandating new or additional limits on greenhouse gas emissions. It warned shareholders about significant costs to comply with environmental laws. , The 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case made it clear that corporations and unions can contribute in unlimited ways to political races, so long as that money comes through super PACs that are not directly coordinated with the candidates. Corporations and unions remain legally barred from giving directly to a candidates campaign. , James Robo, NextEras chairman and chief executive, has personally contributed more than $30,000 to federal candidates since 2008, federal records show. , His donations include $2,700 recently to Bushs campaign, as well as $6,600 to Arizona Sen. John McCains White House run in 2008. He also gave to Democrats, including $10,000 to a fund that helped President Barack Obamas re-election effort in 2012. , The largest individual donor to Right to Rise is South Florida health care entrepreneur Miguel \"Mike\" Hernandez, who donated $3 million. Separately, more than two-dozen other companies with Florida addresses have contributed $100,000 or more to Right to Rise, records show. , They include Southern Strategy Group, a Tallahassee lobbying firm that has long been close to Bush and had employed his former deputy campaign chief. Another $100,000 came from Peace River Products Inc. , run by William \"Bill\" Becker, a longtime Bush family supporter. \"It seems whenever I am in touch with you,\" he wrote the governor in 2006, \"it is for a favor, and I hate to have to do so again.\", ", "Date": "20150805", "Title": "[Pro-Bush super PAC received $1M from Florida power company]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/business/energy/article/Pro-Bush-super-PAC-received-1M-from-Florida-6421050.php", "Author": "[Jack Gillum and Ronnie Greene, Associated Press]"}

Webb has outlined a campaign message centered on helping working-class Americans compete in the economy, reworking the campaign finance system and preventing the U.S. from getting involved in foreign entanglements like Iraq and Afghanistan. , Webb has made frequent trips to the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, but without the impact that Clinton brings to the race or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders unexpected success in raising campaign money and drawing crowds in his own longshot challenge. Also in the field: former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee. , Webbs opposition to the Iraq war, in which his son Jimmy served, was key to his surprise Senate election in 2006 against Republican Sen. George Allen. While Webb chose not to seek re-election after one term, his military and foreign policy credentials could make him a debate-stage foil to Clinton, who served as President Barack Obamas secretary of state. , He said in his statement that as president, he would not have urged the invasion of Iraq and, as senator, he would not have voted to authorize it in 2003, as Clinton did. , Webb has said U.S. foreign policy has been \"adrift\" since the end of the Cold War and called for a new foreign policy doctrine that would outline the circumstances in which the U.S. would use military force. , The ex-senator brings a unique perspective to the field. A graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, Webb served as a company commander in Vietnam and later wrote an acclaimed novel, \"Fields of Fire,\" about the war. At the end of the war, Webb became a Republican, worked in the Defense Department and served as Navy secretary at the end of the Reagan administration. , But he opposed President George W. Bushs decision to invade Iraq in 2003 and was recruited by Democrats to challenge Allen in 2006. Webbs campaign was helped by an anti-Iraq war fervor and missteps by Allen, whose campaign imploded after he called a Democratic tracker \"macaca,\" an ethnic insult. , In the Senate, Webb focused on foreign affairs and veterans issues and was the driving force behind a GI Bill for post-9/11 veterans seeking to attend college after returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. He announced he would not seek re-election in 2012 and returned to writing. , Webb has said he needs to raise enough money to mount a \"viable\" campaign, which could be critical to competing with Clinton and Sanders. , \"Assuming he raises enough money to make a difference, then he could bring a voice that is more appealing to moderate, more rural Democrats and champion their issues,\" said Jamal Simmons, a Democratic strategist.

Scott Walker: Immigration is the banana peel of 2016 Republican presidential politics. Just ask Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. He stepped up as a Senate leader on immigration only to slip and fall in a tea party ruckus over the issue. In a moment of candor, he remembered the months of trying to get back up as a real trial for me. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has a strong voice _ and a book _ on immigration but hes done some shifting of his own. His statements in support of a path to legal status for people in the country illegally are loud and proud, but a departure from an earlier position that envisaged eventual citizenship. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall, File), Likely presidential candidate Scott Walker reiterated Saturday that he opposes any path to citizenship for current undocumented immigrants, insisting that he didnt even use the word \"citizenship\" at a New Hampshire dinner earlier this month when he reportedly endorsed that route to legal status. , \"I made it clear that for me if someone wants to be a citizen they need to go back to their country of origin, get in line, no preferential treatment,\" Walker told reporters before he addressed the Harris County Republican Partys Lincoln-Reagan Dinner in south Houston. \"In terms of what to do beyond that, again thats something weve got to work with Congress on.\", Walkers comments came a day after he visited the Texas-Mexico border alongside Gov. Greg Abbott, who introduced him Saturday evening as someone who \"governs like a Texan.\" Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, pitched himself to county Republican elected officials and donors as a union fighter who has shown how Republicans can win in traditionally Democratic states. , Walker, who won his first election in 2010, survived a recall election triggered by organized labor in 2012, and then won re-election in 2014, is eyeing another election in 2016. But he will have to claw his way to win over establishment backers nationwide - a reality starkly depicted locally Saturday when his speech was preceded by a lengthy video homage to a prominent backer of Walker opponent Jeb Bush: his father, former President George H.W. Bush. , \"We can transform America just like we transformed the states - and were gonna do that in the 2016 election,\" said Walker, who is expected to launch his presidential campaign once Wisconsins legislative session concludes this summer. , Legal path, Walker and Bush, the former governor of Florida, have trailed in the opening stages of the presidential race by concerns over their positions on immigration, which some conservatives see as insufficiently tough. Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Wisconsin governor agreed with providing a pathway to citizenship, which would put him at odds with his prior stated position. Walker said Saturday that he does not support any route to legal status for the immigrants already living in the United States. , \"What I said just now is what Ive said repeatedly, whether in New Hampshire or anywhere else,\" Walker said. \"I dont believe in amnesty in the sense of citizenship. I believe if someone wants to be a legal citizen of the United States, there is a legal path by which to do that.\", Walker has acknowledged changing his position on the issue since 2013, when the presidential hopeful said that he supported some way for undocumented immigrants to eventually become citizens - though those waiting patiently for entry to the United States should have \"first preference.\", Walker now sings a different tune, saying he does not support any \"amnesty\" for those currently living here. But the Journal report suggested that Walker had once again flipped: At a March 13 dinner in the Granite State, Walker said these immigrants should \"eventually get their citizenship without being given preferential treatment.\", Blue-collar voters, On Saturday evening, Walker characterized the Journal story, attributed to \"people present,\" as entirely false. Walker said he talked about an e-verification system and securing the border, but not any options for citizenship. , In his speech here in Houston, Walker largely avoided the immigration issue, instead focusing on his appeal to blue-collar voters potentially key to giving Republicans the White House in 2016. And Abbott, who has avoided endorsing any of the Republicans currently positioning to run, at least endorsed Walkers record. , \"The Wisconsin turnaround is so profound, it is proof that conservative principles really do work,\" Abbott said. \"No Republican presidential candidate has won Wisconsin since Ronald Reagan, but that might just change in 2016.\"]", "Date": "20150328", "Title": "[Wisconsin governor reiterates immigration stance at Houston stop]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/us/article/Wisconsin-governor-defends-immigration-comments-6165628.php", "Author": "[By Theodore Schleifer]"}

Barbara Boxer, its that the contest has been essentially one-dimensional. Democrat Kamala Harris has had the field mostly to herself, despite early predictions for a crowded political bloodbath. , LOS ANGELES (AP)  The first open U.S. Senate seat in a generation in California was expected to attract a large cast of marquee candidates, leading to a spirited scrum next year to replace departing Democrat Barbara Boxer. , So far, that hasnt happened. , The announcement Wednesday that a third, little-known Republican entered the 2016 race speaks mostly to whats been absent from the campaign. Attorney General Kamala Harris got in quickly, established herself as an early Democratic favorite and hasnt been significantly pressured as the contest gradually takes shape. , \"Right now, Harris is the front-runner and every other candidate, of any party, is an afterthought,\" said Rose Kapolczynski, Boxers longtime political adviser, who is not affiliated with any of the 2016 contenders. , Duf Sundheim, who headed the state Republican Party when former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected in 2003, released a video Wednesday declaring his candidacy and promising to work for improved schools, more jobs and better roads. , \"Its an election, not a coronation,\" he said, in an apparent reference to Harris. , The outlook for Republicans isnt promising. The 62-year-old lawyer joins two-term Assemblyman Rocky Chavez of Oceanside and Tom Del Beccaro, another former state GOP leader, as Senate long shots in a state that has become a Democratic fortress in statewide elections. , Youd have to go back nearly three decades to find a Republican elected to the U.S. Senate from California  Pete Wilson, in 1988. Democrats hold every statewide office, control both chambers of the Legislature and a have 2.7-million edge in voter registration. , The 2016 race is in fledgling stages  the primary isnt until June, candidates still have months to get in and early polls have found voters mostly unfamiliar with the race. , Harris biggest potential threat comes from another Democrat, 10-term Rep. Loretta Sanchez from Orange County. However, Sanchez got off to a bumpy start last spring, apologizing in May after a videotape surfaced showing her making a whooping cry in reference to Native Americans that brought a cascade of reprimands from fellow Democrats. She also lags Harris in fundraising. , After a summer lull when the presidential race dominated political headlines, Sanchez adviser Bill Carrick said the campaign will begin accelerating its public activity, including releasing a string of endorsements. , \"I think the thing is wide open,\" Carrick said. , Boxers announcement in January that she wouldnt seek a fifth term opened up a political opportunity that hadnt been seen in years in the state. She and fellow Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein were first elected in 1992. , Twice elected attorney general, Harris benefited from an early start, and prominent Democrats, including former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and billionaire climate activist Tom Steyer, bypassed the race, perhaps to run for governor in 2018. , Sanchez has sought to seize on contrasts with prosecutor Harris, referring to her experience in foreign and military affairs on Capitol Hill. But Roy Behr, another veteran Democratic consultant who has worked with Boxer and isnt tied to any of the campaigns, said Sanchez has yet to follow through on her promise to aggressively stake out policy positions to challenge Harris. , \"You cant beat somebody with nobody, and thats the situation we have right now,\" Behr said, referring to Harris edge thus far. , There are soft spots for Harris that could encourage other rivals. Shes not well known outside her home base in the San Francisco Bay Area, and her fundraising tallies have been so-so for a campaign that could cost $30 million or more. , She had about $3 million in the bank at the end of June, far more than any other candidate, but it can cost $1 million to run a week of TV ads in the Los Angeles market alone. With the popularity of early, mail-in voting in California, those ads must go on the air weeks before election day. , In the second quarter this year, she raised $1.6 million but spent over $900,000 on fundraising and other expenses, records show. , As a candidate, she has limited her interactions with the media since entering the race in January, focusing her time on her day job in Sacramento. , Kapolczynski said Sanchez needs to find an issue to turn the race. , \"When the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings exploded, that created an opportunity for Boxer to become better known,\" she said, referring to the U.S. Supreme Court nomination fight that lifted Boxers profile in advance of the 1992 election, her first win. , Sanchez, she said, \"needs to do something dramatic.\"]", "Date": "20150909", "Title": "[US Senate contest in California shaping up as one-sided]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/article/In-California-another-Republican-joins-US-Senate-6494044.php", "Author": "[Michael R.

Hes traded his brown ostrich boots, nicknamed \"Freedom\" and \"Liberty,\" for sensible shoes, diluted his rugged persona with professorial glasses and tempered the shoot-from-the-hip style that made him something of a gunslinger governor. , Out among Iowas summer fields of not-yet-high corn, Perry is hoping he can stand out without his signature swagger. Some wonder, though, if Perry hasnt lost his distinctiveness, becoming just another middle-aged candidate in casual business attire. , \"He looks so different from four years ago,\" said Nancy Klein Dykstra, 58, who accepted Perrys firm handshake at a community center in rural Ellston, about 80 miles southeast of Des Moines. \"I thought I remembered him being kind of a robust, big guy, big presence.\", Perry admits that hes ditched much of the bravado of his first presidential run. He hopes a more down-to-earth approach will help him in Iowa, where hes spent more time than any presidential candidate so far. He says of Iowans: \"I dont think they care whether its someone who has any swagger or not.\", Still, its been a mega-makeover for Perry, once given a \"Top Cowboy of Texas\" award, and who used a laser-sighted pistol to shoot a coyote while jogging in a sparsely populated corner of Austin during his time as governor. On Saturday, Perry walked on stage at a conservative forum in black dress shoes; no fewer than four of his Republican rivals wore cowboy boots at the same event. , The transformation isnt sitting well with some back home. , \"Hes gotta wear boots; hes from Texas,\" said Rocky Carroll, a Houston bootmaker who has been stitching together custom pairs for Perry since he became state agriculture commissioner in 2001. , Perry wears size 10  E, the same size Carrolls fitted to another client, George W. Bush. But Perry stopped wearing the boots last year, saying they hurt his back. , Thats an especially sore subject since Perry had stem cell surgery in July 2011 to fuse his spine and said post-op painkillers were partly to blame for the collapse of his first presidential campaign. , Carroll said he lowered the heels on Perrys boots afterward to make them easier on his back. , \"He said, They fit all right now,\" Carroll recalled. , But Perry hasnt gone back to boots, instead often lacing up dress Oxfords, like most of his GOP rivals. He frequently wears dark suits and squirms uncomfortably in them at times. , Also gone from 2012 is Perrys brash verbal style. In that campaign, he suggested Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernankes economic policies were \"treasonous\" and Social Security was a Ponzi scheme. This time, Perry largely sticks to talking points and centers his message on his strong job-creation record in Texas. , His folksiness hasnt totally fallen away, however. Perry is fond of expressions like \"the horse is out of the barn,\" and he likes to joke that the 2.5 million people added to Texas population during his 14 years as governor meant \"a lot of new pickup trucks.\", In Ellston, where a Sunday evening crowd of about 80 sampled seven different varieties of homemade pie prepared for his visit, Perry asked 19-year-old Emily Green where the red, white and blue cowboy boots she was wearing were made. When she said Puerto Rico, he exclaimed: \"Good lord, girl! Weve got to get you some El Paso boots.\", Don Kass, chairman of western Iowas Plymouth County Republican Party, met Perry recently and said the two \"had a long conversation about a cow herd.\", To be sure, Texans Lyndon B. Johnson and George W. Bush governed with plenty of Texas swagger of their own  Bush is remembered for invoking the \"dead or alive\" poster of the Old West in the hunt for Osama bin Laden. But Dave Carney, top political strategist for Perrys 2012 campaign, said they toned down that brashness when campaigning in early primary states, and Texans who didnt  Perry in 2012 and Phil Gramm among them  saw their home-state style backfire. , \"As a leader of a state like Texas, that is very effective, but it doesnt necessarily wear well in other states,\" Carney said. \"You talk about swagger, but theres not a lot of success there.\"]", "Date": "20150722", "Title": "[Can Perry stand out in 2016 without his signature swagger?]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/texas/article/Can-Perry-stand-out-in-2016-without-his-signature-6394194.php", "Author": "[Will Weissert, Associated Press]"}

Even if death penalty opponents eventually succeed, the timeline for abolition probably will be measured in years, not months. , Thats because Breyer, joined by Ginsburg, was writing in dissent in a case involving death row inmates in Oklahoma, and five sitting justices, a majority of the court, believe \"it is settled that capital punishment is constitutional,\" as Justice Samuel Alito wrote in his opinion for the court in that same case. , Texas has scheduled back-to-back executions Wednesday and Thursday for Daniel Lee Lopez and Tracy Lane Beatty. , Lopez was convicted of running over a Texas police officer with his car during a high-speed chase. Lopez lawyer already has asked the court to stop the execution. , Beatty strangled his 62-year-old mother, then stole her car and drained her bank accounts. He has an appeal pending in lower courts and could also end up at the Supreme Court. , The justices rarely issue last-minute reprieves to death-row inmates. Even after Breyers opinion calling for a re-examination of capital punishment by the Supreme Court, no justice publicly backed a Missouri inmates plea to halt his execution to allow the court to take up the constitutionality of the death penalty. , Similarly, the three Oklahoma inmates who lost their high court case now face execution in September and October and want the justices to reconsider the decision from June in light of Breyers dissent. The court almost never does that. , The heightened attention on the death penalty comes amid declining use of capital punishment in the United States, and a sharp drop in the number of death penalty prosecutions. , The 18 executions that have taken place so far this year have been carried out in just five states  Texas, Missouri, Georgia, Florida and Oklahoma. Nine of those were in Texas. Twelve states with the death penalty have not had an execution in more than five years. That list includes California and Pennsylvania, which between them have more than 900 death row inmates. , The relatively small number of states that actively seek to carry out death sentences underscores what Ginsburg characterized in late July as \"the luck of the draw.\", \"If you happen to commit a crime in one county in Louisiana, the chances you will get the death penalty are very high. On the other hand, if you commit the same deed in Minnesota, the chances are almost nil,\" she said at a Duke University law school event in Washington. , Texas is far and away the leader in carrying out executions, but it too has seen a drop in the number of new inmates on its death row. No new death sentences have been imposed in Texas this year, said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. , Geographic disparity was among several defects Breyer and Ginsburg identified in June. Another is the length of time many inmates spend living under a sentence of death, which Breyer had previously suggested also might be a violation of the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Six of the 18 men who have been executed in 2015 spent at least 20 years on death row, including one who served 31 years before his execution. , Yet for all the systemic problems opponents of capital punishment can cite, they also have to reckon with what death penalty opponent Michael Meltsner called the \"world of brutality and the awful capacity of people to commit violent crimes.\" One example: The Justice Department, which has otherwise advocated for criminal justice reforms during the Obama administration, won a death sentence in the case of convicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. , \"When awful things happen, people dont think about the costs and benefits. They react to circumstances. There is an ambivalence that has tracked the death penalty debate for many years,\" said Meltsner, a Northeastern University law professor and experienced civil rights lawyer. , Among the questions surrounding the possibility that the Supreme Court would take up the constitutionality of the death penalty is the makeup of the court itself. , With four justices in their late 70s or early 80s, the next president might have the chance to fill several vacancies and could change the courts direction. , \"Obviously, the composition of the court matters greatly and the biggest unknown variable about the life of the American death penalty is the presidential election of 2016. My expected time frame for constitutional abolition varies greatly based on the result,\" said Jordan Steiker, a University of Texas law professor. , It took Breyer and Ginsburg more than 20 years on the Supreme Court to voice their doubt about capital punishment. Justices Harry Blackmun and John Paul Stevens likewise spoke out at the very end of their time on the court. , Steiker said he thinks Breyers dissent will serve as a road map for death penalty lawyers and future justices who may not feel constrained to wait before grappling with executions. , \"It was invigorating to those whod like to see constitutional abolition,\" he said. \"The arguments not new, but they had not been marshaled as effectively by a justice until this opinion.\"]", "Date": "20150809", "Title": "[Justices speak out about death penalty, but executions go on]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/texas/article/Justices-speak-out-about-death-penalty-but-6432603.php", "Author": "[Mark Sherman, Associated Press]"}

The IRS provided poor customer service during this years tax filing season as taxpayers struggled with a rise in identity theft and complications related to President Barack Obamas health law, a government watchdog said Wednesday. A new report by the National Taxpayer Advocate says the IRS has been hampered by budget cuts. , WASHINGTON (AP)  Hello? Hello? Customer service at the IRS hit new lows this year, just as taxpayers were grappling with a wave of identity theft and new requirements under President Barack Obamas health law. , A report issued Wednesday by the National Taxpayer Advocate says the IRS has been hampered by years of budget cuts, which have diminished customer service and hobbled enforcement. , The timing of the budget cuts was bad, the report said. , The IRS blocked nearly 1.6 million suspicious tax refunds this year because of concerns about identity theft  more than double the number from a year ago. About a third of the refunds turned out to be legitimate, but for long stretches during the tax season, fewer than 10 percent of callers could get through to an IRS help line. , \"For the majority of taxpayers who filed their returns and did not require IRS assistance, the filing season was generally successful,\" said the report by Nina E. Olson, the taxpayer advocate. , \"For the segment of taxpayers who required help from the IRS, the filing season was by far the worst in memory,\" the report said. \"To a significant degree, the IRSs shortcomings are budget-driven.\", The taxpayer advocate is an independent office within the IRS. , Overall, only 37 percent of people who called the IRS seeking to talk to a person reached one, the report said. Thats the lowest rate over the past decade, by far. , For those who got through, the average time on hold was 23 minutes. , About 50 million callers reached out to the IRS for help during the tax season. Help lines were so overloaded that the system hung up on 8.8 million callers, the report said. Thats a huge jump from last year, when the IRS hung up on 544,000 callers. , The IRS calls the hang-ups \"courtesy disconnects,\" because the system hangs up early in the call, rather than making callers wait on hold, only to be disconnected later. , \"It is important to note that the IRS must carefully balance limited resources to meet its dual mission of providing taxpayer service and enforcing the tax laws,\" the IRS said in a statement. \"With 75 percent of our budget being personnel, and one-third of our workforce providing taxpayer service, the continuing cuts to our budget have severely hampered our ability to provide taxpayers with the services they need and deserve.\", The report by the taxpayer advocate noted that taxpayer services suffered just as Americans were faced with new requirements under the health law. , For the first time, taxpayers had to tell the IRS whether they had health insurance the previous year. Millions who received government subsidies to pay for premiums had to report those on their returns. , Through April, about 6.6 million taxpayers had to pay fines because they didnt have health insurance, the report said. The fines averaged $190. , Researchers identified more than 300,000 taxpayers who overpaid their fines, the report said. Most of these taxpayers didnt owe fines because their incomes were low enough to qualify for exemptions. , A total of 10.7 million taxpayers claimed they were exempt from the fines. , About 2.6 million families said they received subsidies to help pay for premiums. The subsidies come in the form of tax credits. They averaged $3,000 per tax return, for a total of about $7.7 billion. , Overall, the IRS has done \"a commendable job\" implementing the initial stages of the health law, despite budget cuts, the report said. , Republicans in Congress adamantly oppose Obamas health law, so some have been working to starve the IRS of funds just as its role in implementing the law ramps up. , Congress has cut the agencys budget by $1.2 billion since 2010, and House Republicans are proposing more cuts next year. , Congressional Republicans have been at odds with the IRS ever since the tax agency acknowledged that agents had improperly singled out conservative groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status during the 2010 and 2012 elections. , Since then, the IRS has streamlined the process of filing for tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(3) of the tax code. In Wednesdays report, Olson said agents are now approving applications, \"often based on insufficient information.\", Last year, the IRS approved 94 percent of applications for 501(c)(3) status, which allows donors to deduct contributions. The number of applications approved  94,400  was more than twice as many as the year before. , ", "Date": "20150719", "Title": "[Taxpayer service hits new low at IRS as 'Obamacare' kicks in]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Watchdog-Budget-cuts-lead-to-poor-taxpayer-6385899.php", "Author": "[Stephen Ohlemacher, Associated Press]"}

His wife, Jill, has never relished political life and is said to share his misgivings about whether the Bidens are emotionally equipped for another campaign. , Those close to the second lady say she wont stand in the way of her husbands political ambitions, but her feelings about a White House bid are a major factor in Bidens decision. Only three months after losing their son, Beau, to brain cancer, the 72-year-old Biden appeared somber and weary at an Atlanta synagogue Thursday night as he pondered his familys readiness. \"The honest-to-God answer is I just dont know,\" he said. , While the vice presidents deliberations have played out in semi-public fashion, Jill Bidens have taken place away from the spotlight. She has yet to discuss in detail with her staff her views on a possible presidential run. But she has been looking out for her husband and echoing his concerns about whether he can completely devote himself to a hard-fought campaign, according to several people who have spoken to her in recent weeks. , Some of these people demanded anonymity because they didnt feel comfortable publicly discussing the familys private deliberations. , Sonia Sloan, a Biden family friend since the 1970s who volunteered for his past campaigns, said she saw the Bidens at a mutual friends funeral a few weeks ago and that their grief was \"just written all over them.\", \"Beau was always a part of those deliberations, and they are grieving terribly,\" Sloan said. \"When hes run in the past, the familys been a very active part. This time, given the situation, it will be a really long, thoughtful process.\", Jill Biden campaigned actively for her husband when he ran in 2008, and then when he joined President Barack Obamas winning ticket. As second lady, she has played a visible role promoting education and military families. Said her spokesman, James Gleeson: \"Anyone speculating about Dr. Biden is only doing just that  speculating.\", She previously has said her husband would make an excellent president, Gleeson noted, adding that \"she will continue to support him in his career, as he has always supported Dr. Biden in hers.\", Speculation about a late entrance by Biden has spiked in recent weeks as he has actively explored the possibility of jumping in. Such a move would reshuffle the Democratic primary at a time when some in the party are concerned about Hillary Rodham Clintons campaign struggles and pine for more options. Forty-five percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted Biden to run in a Gallup poll last month. , Biden has been speaking with donors, longtime supporters and potential endorsers as aides and friends tally how much money they might be able to raise for a campaign and how quickly. He and his advisers have told potential supporters that if he were to run, he would not attack Clinton, despite persistent questions about her use of a private email account and server while secretary of state. , \"He has to make a really difficult decision,\" Clinton said in an interview with NBC News on Friday. \"You can see him struggling with it and I just wish the best for him and his family. If he gets into this race, there will be plenty of time to get into the debate and the back and forth.\", Biden, in his most extensive public remarks on his deliberations, said Thursday it would come down to his familys emotional outlook  not on practical considerations like the other candidates standing and building a viable campaign organization. , \"The factor is can I do it. Can my family undertake what is an arduous commitment that wed be proud to undertake in ordinary circumstances?\" Biden said. , Weighing heavily is Beaus wish, conveyed before his death, for his father to run. Another son, Hunter, has been among those reaching out to potential supporters. And sister Valerie Biden Owens, who led previous campaigns, has been intimately involved with the discussions, aides said. , After Bidens wife and infant daughter died in a 1972 car crash, Jill Biden adopted Beau and Hunter. In 2008, Beau Biden corrected NBCs Ann Curry when she referred to Jill Biden as his stepmother. \"My mom,\" he interjected. , Asked whether she was his fathers top adviser, Beau Biden added, \"I call her his number one partner. And it covers all facets.\", A community college professor and former high school teacher, Jill Biden has never hid her lack of enthusiasm for life in the public spotlight, despite supporting her husbands career. In his 2007 book, \"Promises to Keep,\" Biden said his wife was \"sensitive to the demands of a presidential campaign\" before he ran in 1988 and told him their \"childrens lives would surely change.\", She has continued teaching full time throughout his vice presidency, maintaining her own life in addition to her work as second lady. \"She says her students inspire her,\" Biden said Thursday, noting that she returned to the classroom two weeks ago. , \"Shes a tough, smart, compassionate woman who cares about him and about the family,\" said Mark Gitenstein, a former U.S. ambassador and Biden friend who worked for him in the Senate. About Bidens family, Gitenstein said, \"He wont do something they dont want to do, and they wont do something he doesnt want to do.\", ", "Date": "20150907", "Title": "[Amid grief, Jill Biden said to share VP's hesitation on 2016]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Amid-grief-Jill-Biden-said-to-share-VP-s-6485547.php", "Author": "[Josh Lederman, Associated Press]"}

(AP)  Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker is hoping to pull his campaign off the mat by taking on unions  a familiar foe for the Wisconsin governor  in a sweeping plan to upend pillars of organized labor nationwide. , Walkers plan calls for eliminating unions for employees of the federal government, making all workplaces right-to-work unless individual states vote otherwise and scrapping the federal agency that oversees unfair labor practices. , Union leaders are livid. Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union that represents 150,000 federal workers, said Walker is \"declaring a war on middle-class workers.\" And Democratic presidential contender Hillary Rodham Clinton accused him of bullying union members. , One of Walkers Republican rivals challenged the plan, too, saying it is the wrong message for the GOP to send to unionized workers. \"Instead of treating all union members like they are the enemy,\" said former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, \"its time we invite them to give some of us in our party a try.\", In an interview with The Associated Press on Monday, Walker said no one should be surprised. , \"I think people would be shocked if the governor who took on big government special interests wouldnt do it at the federal level,\" Walker said by telephone as he waited to board a plane to Nevada. , In his speech spelling out his \"Power to the People\" proposal at a Las Vegas manufacturer, Walker said he didnt back down against union protesters in Wisconsin and he was ready for the national fight. , \"Collective bargaining is not a right, it is an expensive entitlement,\" he said, speaking with his sleeves rolled up, in between a pair of oversized construction vehicles and in front of a large American flag. , Bob Denoto, a 53-year-old electrician and union recruiter, was in Las Vegas from New York for a union conference and decided to stop by Walkers event.  He didnt like what he heard. , \"I know what the union has given me and my family,\" he said. \"Some day, when Im old and broken down, Im going to be able to retire without government assistance.\", Walkers move comes as he tries to gain traction heading into the second GOP presidential debate, being held Wednesday in California. A weak performance in the first debate and a series of missteps has contributed to his tumble from the polls after his strong start months ago. , \"I think its a good move,\" said Richard Schwarm, a former GOP chairman in the early caucus state of Iowa who is uncommitted in the 2016 race. \"It gets a lot of attention on him in the next day or two.\", Walker won nationwide recognition for eviscerating public-sector unions in Wisconsin and becoming the first governor to prevail in a recall election, which followed huge protests against his anti-union steps. Now hes proposing to go national with an effort to curb union clout. , \"Its reminding people of the reason they liked us in the first place,\" Walker said in the interview, brushing aside with laughter a question about whether the move was a sign of desperation. , The reaction from labor groups and Democrats, their traditional political ally, was fierce. , \"Scott Walker can now add one-trick pony to his resume, right underneath national disgrace,\" said AFL-CIO spokesman Eric Hauser. \"His campaign is floundering and so he does what he always does when he cant think of real solutions. He attacks workers.\", J. David Cox, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union of federal workers, representing about 750,000 people, said its a last-ditch effort by a failing candidate. , \"It appears to me that Scott Walker is pretty much desperate in his campaign right now as hes sinking to the bottom of the polls,\" Cox said. \"This is desperate action on the part of a very desperate candidate.\", Clinton said on Twitter that unions make families strong. , \"Scott Walkers attacks on unions and workers rights arent leadership  theyre bullying,\" she said. , Her main Democratic rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, said Walkers plan would only make rich people and corporations even wealthier. \"If we are going to rebuild the crumbling middle class we need a stronger trade-union movement, not a weaker one,\" he said in a statement. , Labor law experts were taken aback by the scope of Walkers proposal, which seeks to undo decades of law and would gut the landmark National Labor Relations Act  adopted in 1935 and signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the height of the Great Depression. , \"Ive never seen anything like this,\" said Ann Hodges, a professor at the University of Richmond who has studied labor law for more than 40 years. \"This will take the breath away from anyone whos worked in labor relations for any length of time. ... Its pretty draconian.\", Walkers plan also calls for prohibiting the automatic withdrawal of union dues to be used for political purposes and forbidding union organizers from accessing employees personal information, such as their phone numbers. , While Walker could enact some of the proposals via presidential executive order, the most far-reaching ones would require an act of Congress, a major barrier by any measure. , ", "Date": "20150915", "Title": "[Fierce response to Walker plan to bar federal public unions]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/AP-Exclusive-GOP-s-Walker-proposes-vast-union-6502746.php", "Author": "[Scott Bauer, Associated Press]"}

Carson has moved into the top tier of the 2016 presidential race as quietly as Donald Trump crashed the party with bombast, and hell join the billionaire real-estate mogul as a focus of attention at the GOPs second debate. , LOS ANGELES (AP)  Amid all the bombast in the Republican race for president, Ben Carson comes across more like a whisper. , He is, in some ways, the anti-Trump  a gentle candidate who lets his record as a renowned brain surgeon speak for itself. The bragging about his resume and place in the polls, on the rare occasions it comes, is delivered with none of the superlatives that Donald Trump cant seem to go without. , Yet the 63-year-old Republican, the only African-American seeking the White House in 2016  has tapped into the same wave of anti-establishment outrage fueling the billionaire realty TV stars rise. , \"The likelihood of someone like me getting through this process and making it to president is virtually impossible,\" Carson told The Associated Press in a recent interview. \"I just have to be myself. And if being myself resonates with the American people, then they will choose me. , \"And if it doesnt,\" he said, \"they will choose somebody else.\", Like Trump, Carson was dismissed early as a gaffe-prone novice lacking a national profile and any significant political network. But he appears to be connecting with Republican voters at a rate that even his closest aides didnt predict. , Heading into Wednesday nights second debate of the GOP contest, Carson finds himself alongside Trump atop the field. , A New York Times/CBS News poll released Tuesday shows Carson favored by 23 percent of likely Republican primary voters compared to Trumps 27 percent. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, meanwhile, have plummeted to 6 percent and 2 percent respectively. , It should be noted the poll found that 63 percent said they could change their minds before the primaries begin with the Iowa caucuses in February. , Yet it was just one of several in recent days that feature the political rookies Trump and Carson leading a field of veterans of elected office, offering the clearest example yet that Republican voters have deep frustrations with the political establishment. , It shows in Carsons fundraising, too. His campaign says it has raised $5 million so far this month, adding to the $9 million it pulled in during July and August  a strong performance at what is typically one of the hardest times for candidates to raise money. , Wednesday night offers Carson a new chance to build on that momentum. A stage full of Republican candidates will face off at the Reagan Presidential Library for the partys second formal debate. Carson emerged from the first as a surprise success, his popularity fueled by his nice-guy image on a night when his competitors came out swinging. , Yet he remains rough around the edges and has little experience with issues beyond health care and business, particularly foreign policy in an election where international affairs are a major part of the discussion. , \"Hes memorized every nerve in the body, he can memorize the top 12 terrorists in the world,\" said Carson campaign manager Barry Bennett, dismissing any concerns. , His team hopes to use any additional airtime hell get Wednesday night to highlight Carsons biography. , He rose from the streets of inner-city Detroit to be head of pediatric neurosurgery at Baltimores Johns Hopkins Hospital. The story inspired a television movie and gives Carson unique standing in a Republican Party often criticized as the party of older, wealthy, white men. , Carson briefly focused on race late last week by touring Ferguson, Missouri, the St. Louis suburb hit by rioting after a white police officer shot a black teen. After the tour, however, Carson condemned the \"Black Lives Matter\" movement and said the nation should \"de-emphasize race\" and instead \"emphasize respect.\", A religious conservative, Carson said hed prefer the movement change its name to \"All black lives matter\"  to include the unborn children of black women who have abortions. Better yet, he said, the group would change its name to simply, \"All lives matter.\", Hes expected to focus on party unity on the debate stage after declining to respond to his competitors jabs in recent days. , \"Trump will be Trump, Ben will be Ben, and the contrast couldnt be clearer,\" Bennett said. , In contrast to other campaigns, no one has been playing Trump during Carsons debate preparation sessions, which are somewhat unusual. Bennett described an all-day \"knowledge session\" Monday in which experts delivered presentations on various domestic and foreign policy topics. , \"They dont pepper him with questions, he peppers them,\" the campaign manager said. , And while Carson doesnt focus on race, his campaign suggests his status as the only African-American in the contest is a political asset. , \"In a crowd of 17 candidates, it is important that you can differentiate yourself in as many ways as possible,\" Bennett said. \"Hes soft-spoken, hes African-American and hes a doctor.\", The campaign has begun running TV ads in Iowa and New Hampshire promoting Carsons biography.

Carson has moved into the top tier of the 2016 presidential race as quietly as Donald Trump crashed the party with bombast, and hell join the billionaire real-estate mogul as a focus of attention at the GOPs second debate. , LOS ANGELES (AP)  Amid all the bombast in the Republican race for president, Ben Carson comes across more like a whisper. , He is, in some ways, the anti-Trump  a gentle candidate who lets his record as a renowned brain surgeon speak for itself. The bragging about his resume and place in the polls, on the rare occasions it comes, is delivered with none of the superlatives that Donald Trump cant seem to go without. , Yet the 63-year-old Republican, the only African-American seeking the White House in 2016  has tapped into the same wave of anti-establishment outrage fueling the billionaire realty TV stars rise. , \"The likelihood of someone like me getting through this process and making it to president is virtually impossible,\" Carson told The Associated Press in a recent interview. \"I just have to be myself. And if being myself resonates with the American people, then they will choose me. , \"And if it doesnt,\" he said, \"they will choose somebody else.\", Like Trump, Carson was dismissed early as a gaffe-prone novice lacking a national profile and any significant political network. But he appears to be connecting with Republican voters at a rate that even his closest aides didnt predict. , Heading into Wednesday nights second debate of the GOP contest, Carson finds himself alongside Trump atop the field. , A New York Times/CBS News poll released Tuesday shows Carson favored by 23 percent of likely Republican primary voters compared to Trumps 27 percent. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, meanwhile, have plummeted to 6 percent and 2 percent respectively. , It should be noted the poll found that 63 percent said they could change their minds before the primaries begin with the Iowa caucuses in February. , Yet it was just one of several in recent days that feature the political rookies Trump and Carson leading a field of veterans of elected office, offering the clearest example yet that Republican voters have deep frustrations with the political establishment. , It shows in Carsons fundraising, too. His campaign says it has raised $5 million so far this month, adding to the $9 million it pulled in during July and August  a strong performance at what is typically one of the hardest times for candidates to raise money. , Wednesday night offers Carson a new chance to build on that momentum. A stage full of Republican candidates will face off at the Reagan Presidential Library for the partys second formal debate. Carson emerged from the first as a surprise success, his popularity fueled by his nice-guy image on a night when his competitors came out swinging. , Yet he remains rough around the edges and has little experience with issues beyond health care and business, particularly foreign policy in an election where international affairs are a major part of the discussion. , \"Hes memorized every nerve in the body, he can memorize the top 12 terrorists in the world,\" said Carson campaign manager Barry Bennett, dismissing any concerns. , His team hopes to use any additional airtime hell get Wednesday night to highlight Carsons biography. , He rose from the streets of inner-city Detroit to be head of pediatric neurosurgery at Baltimores Johns Hopkins Hospital. The story inspired a television movie and gives Carson unique standing in a Republican Party often criticized as the party of older, wealthy, white men. , Carson briefly focused on race late last week by touring Ferguson, Missouri, the St. Louis suburb hit by rioting after a white police officer shot a black teen. After the tour, however, Carson condemned the \"Black Lives Matter\" movement and said the nation should \"de-emphasize race\" and instead \"emphasize respect.\", A religious conservative, Carson said hed prefer the movement change its name to \"All black lives matter\"  to include the unborn children of black women who have abortions. Better yet, he said, the group would change its name to simply, \"All lives matter.\", Hes expected to focus on party unity on the debate stage after declining to respond to his competitors jabs in recent days. , \"Trump will be Trump, Ben will be Ben, and the contrast couldnt be clearer,\" Bennett said. , In contrast to other campaigns, no one has been playing Trump during Carsons debate preparation sessions, which are somewhat unusual. Bennett described an all-day \"knowledge session\" Monday in which experts delivered presentations on various domestic and foreign policy topics. , \"They dont pepper him with questions, he peppers them,\" the campaign manager said. , And while Carson doesnt focus on race, his campaign suggests his status as the only African-American in the contest is a political asset. , \"In a crowd of 17 candidates, it is important that you can differentiate yourself in as many ways as possible,\" Bennett said. \"Hes soft-spoken, hes African-American and hes a doctor.\", The campaign has begun running TV ads in Iowa and New Hampshire promoting Carsons biography. And its looking to expand a paid staff of 80 now divided between the campaigns suburban Washington headquarters and early voting states across the country. , The political establishment remains skeptical of his chances, but Carson doesnt seem to mind. , \"My whole life people have told me you cant do this, no ones ever done this before, this is impossible,\" he said. \"I dont even get charged up until I hear those words.\", ", "Date": "20150916", "Title": "[Amid Trump bombast, quiet Ben Carson rises in GOP 2016 field]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Amid-Trump-bombast-quiet-Carson-rises-in-GOP-s-6505993.php", "Author": "[Steve Peoples, Associated Press]"}

(AP)  Jeb Bush wanted to run for president as a joyful front-runner, above the fray of the pack. Instead, he heads into the fall campaign as a fighter with a foil: Donald Trump. , Theres a new urgency in Bushs tone as a candidate. Its moved from frustration and annoyance with Trumps constant needling to a willingness to confront the brash billionaire and call him out for his antics. , And though he still relies on the policy-driven arguments that suit his wonkish style, the son and brother of former presidents is also acknowledging whats powered Trumps rise: outrage with the political class his family embodies. Such anger alone, he says, cannot prevail. , \"I believe that a conservative can win, campaigning with his arms wide open, with joy in his heart, speaking about the hopes and aspirations of the people, being on the side of the people that right now dont see their lives in the future being better than what they have today,\" Bush told a crowded hall in New Hampshire late last week. , Bushs aides argue there was no \"aha!\" moment for the former Florida governor that triggered a shift in strategy. Instead, they say, the threat posed by Trump  who has held steady atop polls nationally and in the early voting states for the past six weeks  has awakened an instinctive sense of drive. , \"Its something about Jebs makeup,\" said spokesman Tim Miller. \"He is an extremely competitive person, in all aspects of life. He recognizes that this is a race he has to earn.\", Bush remains viewed by many in the party  as well among his opponents  as the most likely candidate to emerge from the unwieldy GOP field to win the nomination. , Thats due in large part to the more than $114 million Bush has raised for his campaign and allied super PAC  far and away the most of any 2016 White House effort  and the television advertising that money buys. The super PAC is scheduled to begin $21.8 million in advertising in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina this month. , \"Hes still the front-runner, though others could compete\" said veteran GOP presidential adviser Charlie Black, who isnt aligned with any 2016 candidate. He predicted the ads will change public opinion. , Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton often mentions Bush by name, although she has taken to talking about Trump more often in recent weeks. In doing so, shes tried to link Bush to Trumps policies on immigration  an issue on which the two men have vastly different ideas. , And while Trump is an equal opportunity belittler, fighting back against anyone he deems \"not nice,\" he, too, focuses more often than not on Bush. , \"As far as Jeb is concerned,\" Trump said, \"I watched him this morning on television and its a little bit sad. Dont forget, he was supposed to win. And he just doesnt have the energy.\" He made the comment on a day when he pledged to remain a Republican. , Bush displayed plenty of energy during his run through New Hampshire last week. More than 200 voters got a taste of the new approach, and some uncharacteristically blunt language, after a woman asked Bush during a campaign stop in the states northern lake community if hes afraid that contrasting himself with Trump will turn off voters. , \"Im going to push back when he says things that are ugly,\" Bush replied. \"I sure as hell am going to, when he attacks me personally or disparages my family. Damn right, Im going to fight back.\", But, he added to whoops and cheers, \"Im not going to participate in some reality TV show.\" During the same trip, after Trump suggested Bush should only speak English while in the U.S. , the bilingual candidate defiantly told factory workers the GOP should campaign with \"brazos abiertos\"  or open arms. , While Bush engaged with Trump in a contest of snarky Instagram videos last week, he also tried to short-circuit Trumps appeal by joining in bemoaning the failures of those in power. , Referring to a Colorado veterans hospital project that has ballooned in cost, Bush said, \"no one accepts responsibility,\" his voice rising as he jabbed a finger into the air punctuating his words. \"Fix the damn thing. Thats what people want.\", While some supporters are sold on Bushs grittier approach, others are eager to see how it plays out in the months ahead. , \"Theres no worry, yet,\" said Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois. \"It might be a little different if we get too late into the fall and things havent changed.\", Bush voiced confidence they will. , \"Maybe were in the first quarter,\" Bush said, making a football reference. \"Theres a long haul to go.\", ", "Date": "20150911", "Title": "[Trump surge challenges Bush to fight, yet keep the 'joy']", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Trump-surge-challenges-Bush-to-fight-yet-keep-6490224.php", "Author": "[Thomas Beaumont, Associated Press]"}

One of the biggest outside groups backed by billionaire conservative donors Charles and David Koch is spending $1.4 million to attack a Democratic Ohio Senate candidate Strickland in television advertisements. The ads against Strickland are paid for by Americans for Prosperity, a nonprofit group that doesnt disclose its donors. , WASHINGTON (AP)  Americans for Prosperity, one of the biggest outside groups backed by billionaire conservative donors Charles and David Koch, this week begins a $1.4 million television advertising campaign against former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, now a leading Democratic candidate for Senate. , \"We had such devastation and job loss in the state of Ohio when Ted Strickland was our governor,\" a man identified as Bruce says in the 30-second spot, which will air in all of the states major media markets. \"Ive never seen him solve Ohios problems.\", The ad concludes with text on the screen saying: \"Vote against Ted Strickland. Hes failed Ohios families.\" Republican Sen. Rob Portman is up for re-election next year. , The anti-Strickland spot is a rare overtly political message from a group that typically refrains from express advocacy even as it encourages voters to back Republicans. Not since 2012 when it asked voters to reject President Barack Obama has Americans for Prosperity made this kind of ballot-box appeal. , Thats because as a nonprofit advocacy group, it is limited in how much purely political work it can do. In exchange, it can keep its donors private. The difference in messaging can be slight  and lost on viewers. , For example, earlier this month Americans for Prosperity began airing $1.2 million worth of ads against New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat who is weighing whether to run against Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte next year. Those spots criticize Hassans veto of lower taxes as harmful to small businesses. But instead of saying to vote against Hassan, the spot concludes by asking viewers to \"tell Maggie Hassan we cant afford her tax hikes.\", Democratic groups said they arent surprised that outside money is quickly moving into the Ohio Senate race. Strickland has high name recognition, potentially posing a threat to Portman. , \"Washington special interests are lining up to buy this race for Rob Portman so they can keep him in the Senate to do their bidding,\" said Jennifer Donohue, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Democratic Party. , Bridge Project, a Washington-based nonprofit aligned with Democrats, said it will soon release a report detailing how policies backed by the Kochs are bad for Ohio. , \"The Koch brothers know that Rob Portman backs their reckless economic agenda that enriches billionaires like themselves while hurting Ohios middle class and working families,\" said Regan Page, a spokeswoman for the group. , These August ad buys put Americans for Prosperity  it expects to spend at least $225 million this year and next  on early offense in two states that will be important for both the presidential contest and in helping Republicans hold the Senate. Americans for Prosperity has its annual activist summit this week in Columbus, Ohio; former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz are among the GOP presidential candidates scheduled to address the crowd. , The Koch brothers founded the group about a decade ago. It advocates for less government spending, fewer regulations and lower taxes through advertising and voter canvassing across the country. Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, said the anti-Strickland ad, which will be on air throughout August, is meant to \"make sure Ohio citizens remember just how badly people were hurt by his policies.\", The ad says Bruce is a former employee of DHL, a delivery company that closed operations in Ohio. Hes one of 400,000 Ohioans who lost jobs during Stricklands term, the ad says, citing a Labor Department statistic. That same number was in heavy rotation in ads during Stricklands 2010 re-election bid, which he lost to Republican Gov. John Kasich, now a presidential candidate. , Those job losses came as the country was in the midst of a national recession. As a major manufacturing state, Ohio was hit particularly hard. , __, Associated Press writer Julie Carr Smyth contributed to this report from Columbus, Ohio. , __, Follow Julie Bykowicz on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/bykowicz]", "Date": "20150818", "Title": "[Koch group jumps into Senate fight with anti-Strickland ad]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Koch-group-jumps-into-Senate-fight-with-6450071.php", "Author": "[Julie Bykowicz, Associated Press]"}

Among their long-term projections in the 2016 edition: Fabulous weather from coast to coast for Election Day, something that could boost the presidential election turnout, Geiger said. , Also, the unseasonably cold temperatures are supposed to dip down as far as Kentucky this winter, the almanac says. Editors predict milder weather out West, and chilly and wet weather for the South. , The publication, not to be confused with the New Hampshire-based Old Farmers Almanac, uses a prediction method largely unchanged since the first almanac was published in 1818. , Modern scientists consider such methodology to be tomfoolery. But long-term forecasts can be vexing even for conventional scientists. , Mike Halpert, deputy director of the Climate Prediction Center, likened long-term forecasts to finding a \"small signal embedded in a lot of noise.\" The centers forecast for the past mild winter was largely correct, except for frozen New England. The \"polar vortex\" provided another surprise for the federal forecasters during the previous winter. , Last winter, the almanacs prediction of \"shivery and shovelry\" came true in New England, where Boston recorded more than 100 inches of snow  nearly 65 inches in February alone  and set a new snowfall record. But the almanac didnt nail it everywhere: out West, it was unusually warm while the almanac projected cool temperatures. , The almanac is a time-honored tradition with gardening tips, weather, astrology and life hacks. Those topics are resonating with younger readers, not just old-timers. , The almanac distributes 1 million retail copies and 2.5 million promotional versions. But it also has 350,000 subscribers to a weekly email blast, 850,000 Facebook followers, nearly 25,000 Twitter followers and more than 13,000 Instagram followers. Theres also an app for smartphones and tablets. , \"Its not your grandparents almanac, anymore,\" Geiger said. , As for the weather, the editors will let the criticism roll off if their forecast misses the mark. \"All of us can take a lesson from the weather,\" said managing editor Sandi Duncan. \"It pays no attention to criticism.\", ", "Date": "20150823", "Title": "[Farmers' Almanac predicts another nasty winter for Northeast]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/us/article/Farmers-Almanac-predicts-another-nasty-winter-6460518.php", "Author": "[David Sharp, Associated Press]"}

(AP)  The person most talked about during Kentuckys first televised gubernatorial debate wasnt even in the building. , Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis, whose refusal to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples landed her in jail and ignited passions across the country, basically hit the reset button on the high-stakes race. , During an hour-long debate at Bellarmine University that was broadcast live in the states two biggest media markets, the candidates faced a question about whether Davis decision could hurt the states business recruitment efforts. Democrat Jack Conway answered a question from Republican rival Matt Bevin on why he did not defend the states same-sex marriage ban last year. And a viewer from Davis county asked why she had not been charged with official misconduct. , \"My intention has always been to execute this race on financial issues, on economic issues,\" Bevin told reporters after the debate, which was sponsored by The Bluegrass Poll partners. \"In the last several weeks, 85 percent of what people talk about are these social issues. ... I think the issue has redefined this race whether any of us candidates want that to be the case or not.\", Conway, the two-term Democratic attorney general, tried to focus on economic issues, questioning Bevins handling of his personal and corporate taxes and his lack of support for public-private partnerships that Conway says will be crucial to creating job opportunities for Kentuckians in the next decade. But he spent a lot of time defending his decision to not appeal a federal judges decision to overturn Kentuckys same-sex marriage ban last year and his criticism of Davis for refusing to obey a federal judges order to issue marriage licenses. , \"The states highest court has said my duty is to tell the state when things are unconstitutional. Thats what I did. I did that to save us money,\" Conway told Bevin during one of the debates more heated exchanges. \"And that is very different, Mr. Bevin, that is very different than ignoring a federal judges court order. We are a nation of laws.\", Kentucky is one of the few states that elects governors in odd-numbered years, making it the only heavily contested political race in the country and a precursor to the 2016 presidential election. Until now, the race has mostly focused on health care  specifically Democratic Gov. Steve Beshears decision to expand the states Medicaid eligibility under the provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act. The expansion has brought health insurance to more than 400,000 people, many for the first time. But it costs taxpayers more money to pay for all of those people, and Republicans have questioned whether the state can afford it given Kentuckys skyrocketing public pension debt. , Medicaid is a complex issue, making it difficult for the candidates to build their campaigns around it. But Davis refusal to issue marriage licenses for same-sex couples ignited the passions of religious conservatives in an already conservative state and gave them a cause to rally around. , University of Kentucky political science professor Stephen Voss said a race focusing on social and cultural issues will be \"bad for Conway.\", \"He needs to get people thinking about their pocketbooks to improve odds about a Democratic victory,\" Voss said. , Conway tried to do that on Tuesday, focusing his attacks on Bevin for his past statements questioning the effectiveness of early childhood education and for refusing to release his personal tax returns. , \"Mr. Bevin is fond of going around saying, Who do you trust? I dont think you trust someone who has had his own problem with tax issues and wont release his tax returns,\" Conway said.]", "Date": "20150915", "Title": "[Bevin hopes to redefine governor's race on marriage issue]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/article/Bevin-hopes-to-redefine-governor-s-race-on-6507325.php", "Author": "[Adam Beam, Associated Press]"}

(Jon Austria/The Daily Times via AP), FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP)  Navajos voted Tuesday to loosen language requirements for their top leaders, eliminating the need for them to be fluent in Navajo and giving voters more discretion in who can hold elected office. , The passage of the referendum also raises the possibility that the Navajo Nation could elect a non-Navajo-speaking president and vice president in the future, starting with the 2018 election. The vote is a victory for Navajos who rallied around a presidential candidate who was disqualified from the race last year for refusing to have his language skills tested. , \"It tells me that a majority of the Navajo people would like to see youth back at the leadership table,\" said tribal lawmaker Leonard Tsosie, who sponsored the language referendum and joined a crowd gathered in Window Rock where the results were broadcast. \"It shows the Navajo democracy at work.\", Others argued that not having a president speak fluent Navajo diminishes the language that is a defining part of the tribes culture and is recognized worldwide as the basis for a code that helped the U.S. win World War II. More people speak Navajo than any other single American Indian language, but its not widespread among the younger generation. , Bernadette Todacheene, 65, of Shiprock, New Mexico, said Navajos have fought hard to maintain their language through U.S. government efforts to assimilate them into the American society and didnt want to see those struggles dismissed. She voted against the referendum. , \"It is a perplexing point and time where we cannot, we cannot step back,\" she said. , Navajo President Russell Begaye also advocated for keeping the fluency requirement intact. , Not all tribes have a language requirement for their leaders. The neighboring Hopi Tribe requires its top elected official to be fluent in Hopi, for example, and the White Mountain Apache Tribe requires the leader to speak Apache. Other tribal constitutions dont address language skills. , Unofficial results from the Navajo referendum showed that it passed by more than 1,200 votes with all precincts reporting. That means Navajo will determine if candidates for president and vice president speak and understand the language well enough to hold office when they cast their votes. Previously, candidates had to understand Navajo and speak it fluently, a requirement that could be enforced by tribal courts. , More than 122,000 Navajos were registered to vote in Tuesdays referendum that gave tribal members a rare chance to change tribal law. , The Navajo Nation Council called for the referendum months after Chris Deschene was dropped from the presidential race over a question of Navajo language fluency. The issue overshadowed the election that was delayed for months by court challenges, first filed against Deschene. , Terry Teller, of Lukachukai, grew up speaking Navajo but said its not easy to learn and the fluency requirement kept younger Navajos out of the upper level of politics. , \"It discourages Navajos who are educated and live off the reservation to return and help their people,\" said Teller, 36. , Tsosie said he planned to sponsor legislation to create a Navajo language commission that would develop resources to help people learn the language. , About a handful of other referendum elections have been held on the reservation, including one that rejected a tribal takeover of federal health care services and three on tribal casinos. The only citizen-led ballot measures resulted in a significant cut in the number of tribal lawmakers and a presidential line-item veto.]", "Date": "20150721", "Title": "[Navajo Nation loosens language requirements for top leaders]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/us/article/Election-focuses-on-Navajo-language-fluency-6397419.php", "Author": "[Felicia Fonseca, Associated Press]"}
{"Content": "[ Caption, Close, From left: Sylvester Turner, Dr. William Flores, Judge Clarease Yates and Cary Yates at Celebrating 40 Years: University of Houston- Downtown Gala at the JW Marriott Downtown Friday Jan. 23,2015.(Dave Rossman For the Chronicle), The race to succeed Mayor Annise Parker is shaping up to be Houstons most crowded in decades, with a half dozen candidates already having declared they will run and another half dozen possibly joining them. Take a look at the candidates most likely to take the citys top job. , , Declared Definite, , Likely, , Potential, Potential, , Potential, State Rep. Sylvester Turner announced his candidacy for Houston mayor today, formally adding the name of an influential lawmaker with deep ties to the African-American community to the growing field of contenders. , For 25 years, Turner has risen through the ranks of the state House and twice before has looked to parlay that experience into the citys top job. Turner, who for the past year has openly talked about his plan to run a third time, made his decision public Friday in a video to supporters. , \"People in my generation inherited a great city, with folks who have big dreams, and they made big things happen,\" Turner,  a Harvard-educated lawyer who grew up in low-income Acres Homes, will say in the video. \"I see a city still doing that.\", Turner likely will be the early front-runner, as much as there can be a leader at all in a field featuring a dozen potential candidates, nearly all of whom have elected experience. , But few have reached out to the citys movers and shakers over the past 12 months like Turner. He first made his ambitions public last February and has won over many power players in the Democratic establishment, from Sen. John Whitmire to the lobbyists and donors who can steer endorsements, dollars and ultimately votes. , $1 million in bank, He also has steadily raised mayoral money through his legislative account for at least six months. That fundraising - occurring while other mayoral candidates were subject to a fundraising blackout period - allowed Turner to enter 2015 with $1 million in the bank. , On Friday, Turner is expected to name David Mincberg as his campaign treasurer of his mayoral account and inform the Texas Ethics Commission that his legislative account is effectively closed. He will begin the mayoral race with $900,000 of that $1 million to spend, according to his campaign, a head start that motivated a still-alive challenge by one of Turners opponents, Chris Bell, who argues that Turner is violating city campaign laws. , Turner unveiled a policy proposal that tackles what is shaping up to be one of the most prominent debates in 2015: how to repair Houstons gaping potholes and dilapidated streets. Turners \"Road to the Future\" initiative would put Houston teenagers and college students to work by sending them to fix streets. , \"With the condition of our roads right now, you cant just fix a pothole today and assume its not going to need work in the future,\" Turner said in an interview, though details of the plan remained scarce. , Public works review, Turner also will emphasize a wholesale review of the Department of Public Works in order to speed up pothole repair, improving the relationship between police and minority communities and training workers for the jobs businesses need. , Absent from Turners priorities was an indication as to how he would address Houstons looming pension liabilities. It is a problem that City Councilman Stephen Costello, a Turner opponent in the contest, challenged the mayoral field on Thursday to demand local control from the Legislature. That challenge came at a mayoral forum that Turner missed because of his obligations in Austin. , Turner, a senior Democratic budget writer there, likely will put his legislative experience front and center during the campaign. , But it also could be a liability: He cannot raise money now due to a legislative blackout period that runs until June. Meanwhile, his opponents this week released fundraising host committees that will help them inch toward the $2 million each likely needs to be competitive. , Given the caliber and crowd of the field, most mayoral candidates likely will appeal to small slices of the electorate in order to earn the 40,000 votes that most campaigns expect they will need to earn a place in a December runoff. , Complicated path, For Turner, that path is heavily dependent on strong support from the African-American community he has represented for two decades and which typically casts about 30 percent of the vote in municipal elections. , Yet that path could be complicated by the entrance of Ben Hall, an African-American pastor who lost to Mayor Annise Parker in 2013, who also is running for the job again. , Turner plans to kick off his candidacy on March 28 at Minute Maid Park.]", "Date": "20150220", "Title": "[Turner jumps into Houston mayor's race]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/article/Rep-Turner-to-jump-into-mayor-s-race-6091355.php", "Author": "[By Theodore Schleifer]"}
{"Content": "[ Caption, Close, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are about even in a poll of registered voters, but she is significantly ahead in a poll of all American adults. , Around breakfast tables and office coffee pots this weekend, people are handicapping the presidential candidates chances based on Thursday nights Republican debate. , While no clear winners or losers emerged from the pack of candidates, there were winners and losers in any case. , The winners included all the millions of viewers who tuned in to see how the candidates handled themselves under pressure and thought on their feet, skills we all want our next president to have. , Among the losers were those viewers who formed public policy opinions based on the sound-bite answers compelled by the debate time line. The debate format requires people to compete for the most memorable phrase and discourages any discussion of solutions to complex problems. It allowed the candidates to audition for who could make statements like \"life begins at conception\" with the most passion but left citizens wondering about issues such as how each candidate would go about balancing the federal budget. Viewers should not get their facts from debates. , Perhaps the most glaring example of this need to gloss over complexities occurred in the area of foreign policy. A viewer taking the candidates bluster at face-value would think that a U.S. president could face other nations and renegade groups and simply bend them to their will. History has proven otherwise. , Among the winners was Fox News. While no primary debate commands a Super Bowl-sized audience, Republican activists and political junkies throughout the nation and the world were glued to their TV screens and computers last night for what was clearly the starting gun in the race for president 15 months from now. , Democrats who tuned in to observe any \"Whoops!\" moment might believe that the spotlight on Republican infighting made their party the winner. But Democrats who exult should realize that the debate gave 10 citizens a shot to bash the Obama presidency and the Democratic frontrunner before a national television audience.  , The 6 million Facebook users who viewed Foxs debate videos and the 40,000 people who submitted questions using social media were winners with their thoughtful questions and their participation. , The city of Houston took a hit. One-minute answers put a premium on imagery rather than substance. Houston might have been used as an example of how people from different backgrounds and different political ideologies can form a vibrant community and lead the nation in job growth. Instead, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul highlighted the ill-conceived subpoena of pastors in the litigation concerning the HERO ordinance. So our vibrant city was reduced to a single, misguided action by a public official. , Winners on style points may have included \"television personality,\" Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. This candidates polished approach stood in sharp contrast to candidates such as Ohio Gov. Tim Kasich,  who has spent decades as an accomplished work-a-day government official. , Speaking of winners and losers, Donald Trump divides the world into them, and made the claim that the worlds greatest nation is losing and that our nation will only be great again if we elect him as president. But Trump showed himself as a loser when he tried to deflect his misogynist attitude as a rejection of political correctness. , While political campaigns are often compared to a horse race, effective governance is more than a game. Debates are one tool to test a few skills necessary for a president to effectively govern. Our nation will be the winner if viewers understand the pitfalls and virtues of debates and vote on substance over style in 2016.]", "Date": "20150807", "Title": "[Substance over style]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/editorials/article/Substance-over-style-6431867.php", "Author": "[Copyright 2015: Houston Chronicle]"}

{"Content": "[ Caption, Close, Houston City Hall, According to Matthew McConaugheys character in the HBO show \"True Detective,\" time is a flat circle. But at Houstons City Hall, time is a horseshoe - in that we measure the flow of time in the rise and fall of the elected representatives who sit around the horseshoe-shaped council table. Our city charters combination of two-year election cycles and a three-term maximum means that time ends rather quickly for our municipal politicians. Once council members have enough experience under their belts to understand the long-term policy picture or the nuances of city government, theyre forced into retirement and the education process starts all over again. Lessons learned go forgotten. City employees face agendas that shift without a clutch every two years. We keep having the same debates about planning, pensions and infrastructure without fully addressing the big picture. Time at the horseshoe doesnt really end, it just repeats. , City Council should work to break this cycle, and it met on Thursday to do just that. At the second ad hoc charter review committee, council members addressed potential changes to the city charter, including extending term limits from three, two-year terms to two, four-year terms (\"City Council agrees any charter changes belong on November ballot,\" HoustonChronicle.com, Thursday). Were not sure that two, four-year terms is the best option, but it is certainly better. , Council members also agreed that any vote to change the charter should go on the November ballot instead of during a special May election. , The city charter serves as the underlying constitution of local governance. Elections to change that document should be timed to garner the highest possible number of voters, ensuring that Houstonians have a direct say in the manner that theyre governed. The mayoral election in November 2015 promises to be the most heated municipal election in some time. It would be a prime occasion to hold a vote on charter changes. , In addition to changing term limits, the committee also is addressing three other proposals: repeal the citys revenue cap to help pay down the general fund debt; allow closed-door executive sessions for City Council; and remove the mayors exclusive control over the council agenda and allow items to be added to the agenda through a six-member vote. , The revenue cap puts an unnecessary and fiscally irresponsible limit on City Halls ability to draw up a budget. A wise investor would dedicate the windfall of Houstons economic boom toward important projects like repairing infrastructure or paying down debt. A charter vote on the revenue cap will grant Houstonians the opportunity to untie the ropes that bind a steady hand of government. , The other two proposed changes, however, seem less prudent. , Sunshine is the best disinfectant, and council meetings closed to the public will cast a shadow on the transparency that Houstonians should want in their government. At the Thursday meeting, Council Member C.O. Bradford pointed out that plenty of other jurisdictions have the ability to hold closed-door sessions for specific issues that require discretion, such as personnel problems. If council really wants this power, the burden is on them to prove its necessity on an ad hoc basis. , The plan to grant councilmembers the power to put items on the city agenda also should be viewed as an uphill battle. Houston entrusts the mayor with both executive and legislative powers. Gutting the mayors control over council meetings will radically change the way that City Hall works. , A sudden change in government style will have unforeseeable consequences. This proposal would work better as a stand-alone issue that Houston can address another day. , This isnt the first time that Houston has considered expanding our term limits or changing the mayors power over the agenda, and it probably wont be the last. But with growing pension burdens and potholes galore, it is about time we granted City Hall some room to work on long-term issues instead of rushing through a two-year election cycle. ,  Houston can address other concerns afterward. After all, time at the horseshoe doesnt end, it just repeats. ]", "Date": "20141206", "Title": "[Editorial: Charter changes]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/article/Charter-changes-5938735.php", "Author": "[Copyright 2014: Houston Chronicle]"}

His contract expires in June 2016, and the school board had not yet moved to extend it. The 65-year-old said he did not plan to retire, but noted that he underwent a knee replacement over the summer and has a second surgery in November. , \"Time flies when youre having fun. This is, like, year seven,\" Grier told a crowd of administrators at the Houston Independent School Districts central office. \"As I reflect back and look at where we were and where we are today, I couldnt be more proud.\", Several board members said Thursday that they were surprised by the timing of Griers news. He told trustees about his resignation in private shortly before holding a news conference. , Grier has been a polarizing figure from the outset, partly because of his fast-paced rollout of initiatives designed to accelerate achievement among the districts roughly 215,000 students. HISD won the coveted Broad Prize for Urban Education in 2013, though scores on state and national exams generally have stagnated in recent years. , While Grier has outlasted the tenure of most big-city superintendents, board meetings have become increasingly tense. Grier told the Houston Chronicle in May that he and his wife, Nancy, loved Houston and that his future with HISD depended largely on his relationship with the board. Four of nine trustee seats are on the ballot in November. Some candidates have called for Griers ouster. , In June, Grier expressed his frustration with trustees after they repeatedly refused to improve state-mandated school improvement plans. , Grier, however, called the board \"fantastic\" in his speech Thursday. , \"Someone said to me, Well, why now? Whats going on?\" he said, as eight trustees stood behind him. \"You cant be school superintendent in Houston forever, even though you might want to. You just simply cant.\", Board president Rhonda Skillern-Jones, whos up for re-election, suggested to the Chronicle this week that she did not support extending Griers contract. The contract would roll over to 2017 if the board did not take action next year. , \"As a sitting board member, thats a difficult question to answer publicly considering our personnel issues are to be kept private,\" she said. \"But I think Dr. Grier probably has taken the district as far as it can go. Hes made some wonderful contributions, and were grateful for that.\", Griers successes include significantly expanding the number of students taking and passing Advanced Placement exams, raising the high school graduation rate and overseeing passage of a $1.9 billion bond issue, the largest in Texas school history. , His signature reform effort, a three-year experiment called Apollo, resulted in significant gains in math with continued lackluster performance in reading. , Based on the states accountability system, roughly one of five HISD campuses is low-performing. The district had 58 schools rated \"improvement required\" this year, up from 44 in 2014. , Trustee Harvin Moore, one of the four trustees who in 2009 hired Grier, said Thursday that he was \"surprised\" and \"disappointed\" he was leaving. He praised Grier for elevating the quality of staff  which he called \"the best of any district in the U.S.\"  and for expanding the number of dual-language programs in hopes of graduating more bilingual students. , \"He was a person that does not shy away from controversy, if theres something he believes is the right thing to do. And I admire him for that,\" Moore said. , Trustee Greg Meyers, also on the board that hired Grier, walked over to hug him after his resignation announcement. , \"I knew from the beginning we had a superintendent that was going to make significant changes, changes that we needed to make in the interest of our students,\" Meyers said. , Leaders of HISDs largest teacher group focused on the November school board elections, noting that the trustees will be charged with hiring Griers replacement. , \"Will we maintain a board majority focused on unhealthy competition, misuse of testing and profiteering off public education?\" Zeph Capo, president of the Houston Federation of Teachers, said in a statement. \"Or will we elect a board that will focus on collaboration with all stakeholders to build the successful schools our kids deserve? Our kids and our dedicated school employees deserve no less.\", Chuck Robinson, executive director of the Congress of Houston Teachers, characterized Griers tenure as \"tumultuous.\", \"I dont have anything personally against the man,\" Robinson said. \"But weve had some very strong disagreements with some of his major initiatives  specifically, this mass termination of teachers, which has not moved the needle on the test scores.\", Grier oversaw the rollout of a new teacher evaluation system based in part on their students test scores. , Griers tenure has been marked by turnover at all levels. Teacher turnover hit 20 percent in 2013-14, the highest level in a decade. As of last school year, more than two-thirds of campuses had at least two different principals since Grier arrived. , Drew Houlihan, Griers fifth chief academic officer, described his boss as \"highly visionary.\", \"He has a very high level of expectations,\" Houlihan said. \"One of the quotes he uses that I always keep in my mind is, Students have only one chance in school.\", The school board and Grier still must negotiate any exit package, said HISD spokeswoman Holly Huffman. His annual salary is $300,000, plus $19,200 in stipends for his car and technology. He also is eligible for bonuses totaling $125,000. , Grier said he planned to work hard through March. , \"Weve got a lot left to do,\" he said. , He pledged to fulfill promises made as part of the districts 2012 bond referendum. His administration recently reported a potential $211 million shortfall that he attributed to inflation in the construction market. , \"Weve had some issues with funding. Thats going be resolved,\" Grier said. \"We are going to build the schools that we promised we were going to build. And when were finished, Houston, Texas, is going to have the finest portfolio of new high schools in any urban city in America.\", The crowd applauded. , Take a closer look at Griers time and office and how HISD fared under his leadership on HoustonChronicle.com.]", "Date": "20150911", "Title": "[Grier out as Houston ISD superintendent]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/education/article/Grier-out-as-Houston-ISD-superintendent-6496621.php", "Author": "[By Ericka Mellon]"}

While critics say about 6 percent of the states hourly wage earners in 2013 got minimum wage or less, fifth highest in the nation, Perry counters that this figure has fallen three straight years since 2010, when Texas rate peaked at a national high 9.5 percent. , Perry credits the gangbusters state economy to low taxes, restrained regulation and caps on civil litigation damage awards, as well as improving high school graduation rates.

(Bryon Houlgrave/The Des Moines Register via AP) , MAGS OUT, TV OUT, MANDATORY CREDIT, JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP)  While Congress remains stalled on a long-term plan for funding highways, state lawmakers and governors arent waiting around. , Nearly one-third of the states have approved measures this year that could collectively raise billions of dollars through higher fuel taxes, vehicle fees and bonds to repair old bridges and roads and relieve traffic congestion, according to an analysis by The Associated Press. , The surge of activity means at least half of the states  from coast to coast, in both Republican and Democratic areas  now have passed transportation funding measures since 2013. , And the movement may not be done yet. , Tennessees governor is in the midst of a 15-city tour highlighting the states transportation needs. North Carolina lawmakers are debating a road-bonding proposal. And legislators are returning to work this week in California and Michigan with transportation funding on the agenda. , \"I dont know of a state thats not having the conversation\" about raising revenue for transportation, said Iowa Transportation Director Paul Trombino III, who is vice president of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials and whose home state recently raised fuel taxes by 10 cents a gallon. , The widespread focus on transportation funding comes as state officials are becoming frustrated by federal inaction in helping to repair roads and bridges described as crumbling, aging and unsafe. , About 20 percent of the nations 900,000 miles of interstates and major roads need resurfacing or reconstruction, according to one analysis of federal data. A quarter of the 600,000 bridges are considered structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. That doesnt necessarily mean they are about to fall; it means they are showing worrisome problems or are no longer adequate for todays traffic. , \"Theres a lot of voices that say lets push this off,\" said Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, whose call for more transportation funding has been opposed by some fellow Republicans. \"But the need is not going to go away. Were going to have to do something to address this.\", In many states, the new money is going primarily toward repairing old infrastructure, though some projects  such as a new four-lane U.S. 20 across Iowa  are designed to ease congestion so that commerce can flow more freely. , Congress has yet to agree on long-term funding to supplement the states efforts. Instead, it recently passed its 34th short-term extension of the nations transportation program since 2009, ensuring only that states will continue to receive federal highway funding through Oct. 29. , Federal dollars, on average, cover about half of a states capital expenditures for roads and bridges, according to the American Road & Transportation Builders Association. But the money available from the Federal Highway Trust Fund declined 3.5 percent during the five-year period ending in 2013, the latest year for which numbers are available, because of improved fuel economy and other factors. The fund receives money from federal taxes on gasoline and diesel. , Regardless of what Congress ultimately does, some state officials say more taxpayer money will be required to update their aging infrastructure for the modern economy. The newly passed measures put only a dent in a backlog of projects. , In Connecticut, for example, legislators recently approved $2.8 billion of additional transportation bonding over the next five years. But thats just the start of what Democratic Gov. Dannel Malloy hopes will be a 30-year, $100 billion overhaul of the states transportation system. , Idaho Gov. C.L. \"Butch\" Otter, a Republican, signed a law this spring raising the fuel tax by 7 cents a gallon and increasing vehicle registration fees. Thats projected to raise $95 million a year, barely a third of the $262 million annual shortfall in the transportation system. , Legislators in Kentucky and North Carolina where tax rates are linked to the price of fuel  passed measures to avert large cuts caused by falling fuel prices. But those bills didnt generate any additional money. , Though politicians often talk about coming up with creative ways of funding roads, many states have resorted to the traditional means of taxing and borrowing. Thats caused consternation for some Republicans who have campaigned against such things. But it helps that 2015 isnt an election year. , Nebraskas single-house legislature, which is dominated by Republicans, overrode Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts veto to enact a 6-cent-a-gallon fuel tax increase. , \"I had to do a great deal of soul-searching\" on a fuel tax increase, said sponsor Sen. Jim Smith, a conservative Republican. But he added: \"The magnitude of the (transportation) backlog was so large that we would not be able to tackle that with gains and efficiencies alone.\", Transportation economist George Hoffer of the University of Richmond in Virginia said many politicians find it more palatable to raise the fuel tax than other taxes because \"its considered equitable  the more you use, the more you pay.\", Also, because fuel prices regularly fluctuate, its sometimes harder for motorists to notice the added tax. , \"If its infrastructure-related, thats a legitimate reason to raise it,\" said motorist Lauren Sharkey of Spokane, Washington, where the state gasoline tax increased by 7 cents on Aug. 1 as part of a new 16-year, $16 billion transportation plan. , In states that havent raised road taxes, some local governments are forging ahead on their own.

{"Content": "[ Caption, Close, In this Aug. 14, 2015 photo, Republican presidential candidate, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, speaks at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines, Iowa. Bushs powerfully funded super political action committee will spend at least $10 million on Aug. 17 to buy television advertising in several early voting states. Its the first salvo of whats expected to become a massive television ad campaign to back the former Florida governors presidential bid. , DES MOINES, Iowa (AP)  The heavily funded super PAC backing Republican Jeb Bush will spend at least $10 million on television time in the earliest voting presidential primary states, the first salvo in a massive TV ad campaign to support the former Florida governors bid for the Republican nomination. , Officials with Right to Rise USA say they will buy time in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina TV markets and on cable television in the three states. Ads are scheduled to begin in Iowa and New Hampshire on Sept. 15, in South Carolina a week later and then run continuously through the end of the year. , The plan, shared by the group with The Associated Press prior to Mondays buy, is the first evidence of Right to Rise USAs  major strategic spending of the roughly $100 million it had on hand last month. Its also the first major move by the group, which was developed by longtime Bush adviser and California ad maker Mike Murphy, to run alongside Bushs own campaign organization, which is bound by federal fundraising limits. , \"We believe Jeb Bush has the strongest record of conservative accomplishments in the race, and we plan to tell that story,\" Paul Lindsay, communication director for Right to Rise USA, told the AP. , The first ads will be positive spots promoting Bush in a field that includes 16 other major GOP candidates. They will resemble videos on the groups website, promoting Bush and his accomplishments as Florida governor from 1999 to 2007. One piece was taken from clips of Bush from the Aug. 6 Republican debate in Cleveland, Lindsay said. , That does not mean the groups ads wont turn to criticizing Republican rivals once the first contests draw near. The group has already aired one online ad that points to Bushs release of decades of tax returns and publication of thousands of emails sent during his time as governor, to draw comparisons with Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton, who recently turned over her private email server to the FBI under pressure. , To date, the group, based in southern California, has spent roughly $200,000 on online advertising. , The new expenditure, which Lindsay described as an \"eight-figure\" buy, is significant because its the first big expense for the group that Bush helped raise more than $103 million to finance, and which is expected to perform other campaign functions in support of the former governor. , Under Federal Election Commission rules, Bush, having declared his candidacy on June 15, is now forbidden as a candidate from directly soliciting money for the group or advising how to spend it. However, before declaring his candidacy, Bush was involved in fundraising for Right to Rise USA, while Murphy planned a long-term strategy where the super PAC would complement the campaign, which is bound by fundraising restrictions that dont apply to super PACs. , The idea of a parallel outside group that can raise unlimited sums from individuals, corporations and groups is not new. Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee, attempted it later in his campaign. And other GOP candidates for the 2016 GOP nomination have formed super PACs and have begun buying advertising time in early states. , However, none has combined the planning strategy with the sums of money Bushs super PAC has been able to raise, making it a pioneering effort in the super PAC era of presidential campaigning. , In June, the group announced it had met its ambitious goal of raising more than $100 million, taking full advantage of the nations campaign finance laws to collect $103 million over the first six months of 2015. In June, the group had a balance of $98 million. , No candidate for president has benefited from so much money so early in a campaign. , Aides to the super PAC noted that similar groups supporting other candidates have purchased advertising time in early states. Some have also aired spots aimed at bumping up a candidates national poll numbers to help them gain entry into debates that require top-10 standing. , Right to Rise USA aides said their strategy is long-term, aimed at building sustained name identification and support heading into the Iowa caucuses, which begin the 2016 voting on Feb. 1, followed by the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries. , ", "Date": "20150819", "Title": "[Pro-Bush super PAC spending $10M-plus on initial TV campaign]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Pro-Bush-super-PAC-spending-10M-plus-on-initial-6447099.php", "Author": "[Thomas Beaumont, Associated Press]"}

From a small urban clinic guarded by a team of armed police, Paul joined six eye surgeons who restored vision to dozens of impoverished Haitians, many living for years in blindness because of ailments such as cataracts that are easily treated in the United States. , The trip offered the tea party firebrand a brief respite from a presidential campaign in which his standing has slipped substantially in recent weeks. Yet the 2016 election  especially Trump  was a regular topic of conversation when Paul wasnt in the operating room. , \"His candidacy is an insult to the intellectual movement that has called for small government for decades,\" said Paul, wearing operating room scrubs, in an interview with The Associated Press shortly before returning to surgery Tuesday morning. He described the reality TV stars candidacy as \"buffoonery\" and promised to continue leading the anti-Trump charge \"until he fades away.\", This weeks Haiti trip was organized by the University of Utahs Moran Eye Center, an institution that organizes regular missions to combat \"curable blindness\" in developing nations around the world. Paul participated in a similar mission with the same group last summer in Guatemala. , While the trip was not technically part of Pauls presidential campaign, he invited a small number of political journalists and at least one prominent donor to join him. Due to security concerns, his team asked that reporting of the trip be restricted until Paul left the country. , His team helped raise at least $70,000 for the eye center before the trip. One of the benefactors was Trump himself, who donated $10,000 to the university at Pauls request roughly two months ago. That was shortly before Paul began aggressively challenging Trumps conservative credentials. , \"No one is pure evil,\" Paul said of Trump when asked about his contribution. \"He has some redeeming qualities.\", Paul arrived in Haiti on Sunday aboard the private jet of Republican donor Gary Heavin, the Texas-based founder of the Curves fitness center franchise. He and his wife were at Pauls side for much of the week. , Heavin, who has been active in Haitian charity work since a 2010 earthquake devastated the capital city, said hes yet to decide whether to support Paul formally, but hes already ruled out the other candidates. , \"If I support anyone in the Republican Party, its him,\" Heavin said in an interview on a bustling street outside the eye clinic. He said he has the capacity to donate more than $10 million and would back Paul if Heavin is \"confident in his ability to influence the process.\", Paul, meanwhile, is betting that he can influence the process best by being aggressive. , He condemned Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose family foundation has raised more than $30 million for Haiti since the 2010 earthquake. , \"To me the most disgusting thing about the Clinton foundation is almost none of their money went to charity,\" Paul said, suggesting that only 6 percent of the Clinton Global Initiatives revenue went to charitable grants. A spokesman for the organization didnt respond to a request for comment. The group previously said grants make up only a small fraction of its charitable work, which is largely handled by staff. , Asked about Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walkers recent criticism of Washington-based Republicans, Paul charged, \"Part of problem we have is career politicians like Scott Walker.\", \"Has he ever had a job outside of politics?\" Paul went on. \"He was running for office when he was in college. Im not going to be lectured by a career politician, thats for sure.\", And on Chris Christie, Paul said that the New Jersey governor exaggerated his role in the response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks during the recent GOP debate. \"People wrap themselves in tragedy so they dont have to argue the point,\" Paul said. , Paul said he had little choice but to go on the attack to stand out in the crowded race. , \"Right now, people are choosing theatrics over substance,\" he said. \"And so, you just have to compete in the arena the way the arena is arranged.\"]", "Date": "20150823", "Title": "[Rand Paul: a humanitarian in Haiti, a pit bull in 2016 race]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Rand-Paul-a-humanitarian-in-Haiti-a-pit-bull-in-6454659.php", "Author": "[Steve Peoples, Associated Press]"}

But here in the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, \"curable blindness\" from common ailments such as cataracts is normal. , \"If Jesus can give me back my vision, I will be happy,\" said Saint Fleur, who would soon have a cataract almost the size of a dime removed from his left eye. The aging man, who balances himself with a worn walking stick, said he wanted his vision back simply to see his family again. , He was among scores of Haitians  adults and children  who streamed through the hallways of Vision Plus Clinique, a nondescript, two-story building set in the heart of Haitis largest north-coast city and guarded by a team of armed police and a private security detail for the mission. , Despite the humanitarian focus, Pauls precarious place in the 2016 presidential contest was never quite forgotten. , Considered a formidable White House contender for much of the last year, the first-term senators standing in the GOP field has suffered following billionaire businessman Donald Trumps sharp rise. Declining poll numbers could jeopardize Pauls place in next months prime-time debate as he struggles to attract major donors to fund a national network borrowed from his fathers passionate following. , Paul acknowledged his recent struggle during an interview at a Cap-Haitien hotel, where razor-wire protects the outer walls and raw sewage flows into the nearby ocean. , \"Its sort of like a schoolyard. Once you got em down, everybody piles on,\" Paul said of the 2016 contest. \"And Ive been under a dog pile for a couple of weeks.\", There may be cause for optimism, however, in the face of Gary Heavin, a cigar-chomping billionaire and Republican donor who was at Pauls side much of the week, having arrived with the senator and some of the other doctors on his private jet. , Heavin, the Texas-based founder of the Curves health club franchise, has been active in Haitian charity work since a 2010 earthquake left more than 100,000 dead and millions homeless in the nations capital, Port-au-Prince.

He said he has the capacity to donate more than $10 million and would back Paul if \"confident in his ability to influence the process.\", Paul has worked aggressively to broaden his support beyond the small, but passionate group of his fathers loyal supporters. Yet many prominent donors and GOP establishment figures have balked, largely because of the younger Pauls foreign policy views. , Like his father, former Rep. Ron Paul, Rand Paul favors a dramatically smaller footprint in the world. He has proposed federal budgets that would eliminate virtually all U.S. funding to foreign governments. , He didnt back off such positions while in Haiti. , \"The U.S. has had a big role for many, many years here,\" said Paul, who also is seeking re-election to the Senate. \"It hasnt fixed things.\", \"We borrow it from China to give it to Haiti. Thats not charity, thats just bad policy,\" he added, encouraging private donations instead of government support. He didnt rule out government aid altogether, however, particularly for food and water \"in an immediate disaster.\", At the eye center, at least, it was easy to find evidence that Pauls privately-funded mission made a difference. , The trip was organized by the University of Utahs Moran Eye Center, which regularly leads trips designed to train local doctors and address \"curable blindness\" in poor areas around the world. Cataract surgeries often take no longer than 20 minutes, allowing teams of volunteer surgeons to perform dozens in a single day. The Haiti group completed 109 surgeries on the three days Paul was on hand and expected to finish nearly 200 by the time the full group left the country on Saturday. , On Tuesday morning, the day after his surgery, Saint Fleur sat in a room crowded with patients quietly waiting for the bandages to come off. , He was speechless for a few moments after the white gauze was peeled away. Then he began to smile. , \"I see! I see!\" he said, joy spreading across his face. And with shaking hands, he began reaching out for nearby medical staff, hugging anyone he could and affectionately touching their faces. , \"I love you,\" he told a nurse. \"Yesterday I couldnt see!\", Saint Fleur then spoke directly to Paul: \"If its for money, I could not do this.

And she shrugged off questions about her server being wiped clean, asking facetiously in Nevada, \"Like a cloth or something?\", \"I dont think the campaign has handled it very well,\" Florida Sen. Bill Nelson told The Associated Press on Thursday. \"I think the advice to her of making a joke out of it  I think that was not good advice.\", Nelson said if Clinton had received information that should have been labeled classified or top secret, the person sending the email would bear the responsibility of making that clear on the email. \"If she is receiving something on a private email account and it has no designation, then how would she know that it is classified?\" he asked. , In Republican-leaning Kentucky, Democratic Rep. John Yarmuth warned in an interview with WHAS-TV in Louisville, \"I still think there is a chance that this could upend her campaign.\", \"I just never feel like I have a grasp of what the facts are,\" Yarmuth said Wednesday. \"Clearly she has handled it poorly from the first day. And theres the appearance of dishonesty, if its not dishonest.\", The new concerns follow Clintons decision to turn over her server to federal investigators who are trying to determine if the data on it was secure. , Democratic California Gov. Jerry Brown compared the controversy to a \"vampire\" in an interview Friday with NBC News \"Meet the Press,\" saying it has \"some kind of dark energy that gets everybody excited.\", \"Shes going to have to find a stake and put it right through the heart of these emails in some way,\" Brown said. , Clinton holds a wide but narrowing lead in the Democratic field against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has picked up ground on her in New Hampshire and Iowa. Former Maryland Gov.

Rick Perry, waves to the crowd as he steps to the podium to speak at the RedState Gathering in Atlanta. Perry has stopped paying his presidential campaign staff amid slow fundraising that has left his 2016 bid cash-starved after barely two months. , AUSTIN, Texas (AP)  Rick Perry has raised so little money for his second-chance presidential bid that hes stopped paying his campaign staffers, the kind of cash crisis that could normally sink a candidate. , But the former Texas governor has well-funded super PACs that say theyre ready to step in and keep his message afloat at least through the Feb. 1 caucuses in Iowa, where Perry has spent more time than any other White House hopeful. , Its the latest sign of how influential outside groups  armed with small cadres of million-dollar donors  are reshaping presidential politics. , Perry raised only about $1 million in his first month of campaigning, a sum that isnt enough to cover his payroll. A pair of pro-Perry outside groups, each with \"Opportunity and Freedom\" in its name, amassed almost $17 million over the same period. , Those groups, both super political action committees, are barred by federal rules from talking directly to the candidate they support. , But it became apparent recently to Austin Barbour, the Republican operative who leads them, how important their role would have to become. The groups began spending money not just on advertisements, but also on employees who can fill roles normally left to the traditional campaign. , They hired an Iowa director and deputy director, who now are putting together a super PAC-run ground game in the state that weighs in first in the presidential nominating season. Barbour said hes prepared to hire staff in other early primary states, if necessary. , \"We saw in the campaign finance reports that they didnt raise as much as anyone would have liked, and we knew what that meant  that they were going to have to go lean and mean while we would need to diversify what we were doing to help the governor,\" Barbour said. \"Were building Perrys Iowa team. Theres nothing in the playbook that says we cant do that as a super PAC.\", Even with so much outside help, money problems plaguing Perrys campaign this early could leave future donors  as well as potential primary voters  wondering whether he can survive for the long haul in the crowded a GOP field. Another potential fundraising blow came last week when Perrys low national polling numbers kept him off the prime-time debate stage, which reached 24 million Fox News viewers. , \"Its the deterioration of the campaign, and theres no pretty face, no makeup you can put on it,\" said Bill Miller, a Texas-based GOP strategist. \"Its like a NASCAR race. He doesnt have the pole position, and now he doesnt even have a full tank of gas.\", Yet reports on Tuesday of Perrys money troubles prompted a longtime friend of the former governor to give the super PACs $100,000, Barbour said, declining to name the contributor. , Perrys official campaign is continuing as best it can, said Jeff Miller, his campaign manager. All but one staff member has agreed to continue working without pay, and Perry will be in South Carolina later this week before returning to Iowa next week, Miller said. , \"Are we raising as much money as wed like to? No. Are we still going to continue the governors regular visits every week to early states? Yes,\" Miller said. , The Perry campaigns Iowa state chairman, Sam Clovis, said Tuesday he would continue working as a volunteer. \"I know everything there is to know about running a campaign with very little money,\" Clovis said. , Perrys not alone in relying heavily on super PACs. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former technology executive Carly Fiorina are leaning on outside groups to build their name recognition. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorums ex-campaign manager and two other staff members recently left his financially troubled campaign to form a super PAC supporting him. And former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has a massive super PAC ready to help him with voter outreach. , In 2012, the support of a super PAC helped former House Speaker Newt Gingrich win South Carolinas primary and continue competing for the presidency after traditional campaign money dried up. , Donors can give $2,700 maximum per election to campaigns, but there are no limits on what they can give to super PACs. Dallas businessmen Kelcy Warren and Darwin Deason gave a total of $11 million to the super PACs backing Perry, even though Warren also serves as the finance chairman for Perrys official campaign. , The super PACs would have to wait 120 days to bring aboard anyone currently with the Perry campaign. Barbour said the groups have hired different people, while refusing to say how many are now on the payroll. , Opportunity and Freedom has spent more than $2 million so far on pro-Perry ads and will continue to provide such messaging. , ", "Date": "20150814", "Title": "[Can super PAC support save cash-strapped Perry bid?]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/texas/article/Perry-s-cash-strapped-2016-campaign-stops-paying-6437600.php", "Author": "[Will Weissert and Julie Bykowicz, Associated Press]"}

The investigation involved filing massive public records requests with the system flagship, which the report said clocked in at 800,000 pages and cost $1 million to compile. , While it decided not to indict the Gov.

They came up with the idea after Emma took this picture with Christie.

The teenagers from Merrimack, N.H. , are attempting to take photos with every presidential candidate campaigning in the state. (Emma Nozell via AP), CONCORD, N.H. (AP)  Addy and Emma Nozell arent the first New Hampshire residents to collect photos of themselves with as many presidential candidates as possible. But the in the age of selfies and social media, the Merrimack sisters are attracting a lot of attention, so much so that candidates now arrive in the state ready for their close-ups with the teens. , Here are five things to know about New Hampshires presidential selfie sisters:, THE FIRST:, It all started on July 2, when 15-year-old Emma decided she wanted to snap a photo of herself with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. They caught up with him in Nashua, where Christie stopped at an ice cream stand and later picked up the endorsement of the citys former mayor. , \"I took a selfie with him, and then Addy decided, Why not get em with everyone?\" Emma said. , While that encounter marked their first foray into presidential selfies, the girls are no strangers to the campaign trail. Their parents have made a point of taking them to political events since they were babies, an experience that gave them confidence that theyd accomplish their goal. , \"Since our parents bring us to all these events, we thought it was pretty do-able,\" said Addy. \"We were always in the parades, we were always making signs. We were always helping them with whatever was needed.\", THE WORST:, Of all the selfies so far, the sisters are least happy with their picture with former Texas Gov. Rick Perry because hes not looking at the camera. (Theyve offered him a do-over.) In terms of overall experience, the most difficult meeting was with Dr. Ben Carson, who wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post website criticizing the \"obvious narcissism of endlessly photographing oneself and blasting it over social networks for others to admire.\" Though her parents warned her not to be upset if she got turned down, Emma was determined, albeit nervous. , \"I went up to him and said, I know you dont like selfies, I understand that, but Im doing this project with all the other candidates,\" Emma said. \"I was wondering if you could take a selfie with me.\", He said yes. , THE METHOD:, Having honed their skills over several weeks, the sisters have some advice for fellow selfie seekers. , \"We find a hole in the crowd, we make eye contact with them if we can, and we smile,\" Addy said. , Asking permission is a must, but selfie sticks are a no-no, she said, because they are too unwieldy in large crowds. , \"And dont be afraid to get up in there,\" said Emma, who generally is the one snapping the photos. , On Thursday, the girls approached Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker at a crowded diner in Amherst. He demurred at first, saying hed pose with them after his speech. But Emma knew there wouldnt be enough time afterward, and it would be too crowded. , \"I was like, no, we gotta take it now,\" she said. \"Before he said one word.\", THE DONALD:, By the time the girls caught up with Donald Trump at the Weirs Beach Community Center on Thursday, however, something had shifted. Instead of having to push through a crowd, they faced a clear walkway and a candidate who appeared to be waiting for them. , \"When we went up to Trump, his handlers said These are the girls, and he said, Oh, all right, lets get the selfie,\" Addy said. \"We were flabbergasted. Wow. He knew!\", THE FUTURE:, Neither girl will be old enough to vote in New Hampshires first-in-the-nation presidential primary, though Addy will turn 18 before the general election. She said she leans toward Democrats, but is open to Republicans as well, and has liked some of what she has heard on the campaign trail. , \"I probably wont decide until the very last minute,\" she said. , Both sisters said they have learned a lot, not just about the candidates but about the media after having been interviewed numerous times for print, radio, television and online audiences.]", "Date": "20150720", "Title": "['Say 2016!'

The GOPs 2008 nominee, Sen. John McCain, was born in the Panama Canal Zone to American parents. Former Michigan Gov. George Romney was born in Mexico to American parents. In neither case was the country of birth a driving factor in the campaigns, and leaders from both parties cleared the way for the candidacies. , As well, some \"birthers\" contended President Barack Obama was born in Kenya and have clung to that assertion despite proof offered by Obama in 2008 and 2012 that he was born in the U.S.]", "Date": "20150313", "Title": "[Despite Canadian birth, legal duo says Cruz eligible to seek presidency]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Harvard-Law-Review-article-Cruz-eligible-to-seek-6132613.php", "Author": "[Phlip Elliott, The Associated Press]"}

John Kasich, was asked whether he would have a problem with a Muslim in the White House. \"The answer is, at the end of the day, youve got to go through the rigors, and people will look at everything. But, for me, the most important thing about being president is you have leadership skills, you know what youre doing and you can help fix this country and raise this country. Those are the qualifications that matter to me.\", Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who taped Sunday an episode of Iowa Press, an Iowa Public Television program, was asked if he agreed with Carsons statements on Muslims being president. \"The Constitution specifies that there shall be no religious test for public office, and I am a constitutionalist,\" Cruz said. , Carsons comments came amid lingering fallout over Republican Donald Trumps refusal last week to take issue with a man during a campaign event who wrongly called President Barack Obama a Muslim and said Muslims are \"a problem in this country.\", Also speaking on NBC on Sunday, Trump said that a Muslim in the White House is \"something that could happen... Some people have said it already happened, frankly.\", In multiple interviews Sunday, Trump tried to draw a distinction between all American Muslims and extremist Muslims in the U.S. and elsewhere. , \"I have friends that are Muslims theyre great people, amazing people,\" Trump said on CNNs \"State of the Union.\", \"You have extremists Muslims that are in a class by themselves,\" Trump added. \"Its a problem in this country, its a problem throughout this world.... You do have a problem with radical Muslims.\", GOP candidates have been split over whether to criticize Trump, who has been a vocal skeptic of Obamas birthplace and faith. Obama is Christian. , In the NBC interview, Carson said he believes that Obama was born in the U.S. and is Christian, saying he has \"no reason to doubt\" what the president says. , Carson also made a distinction when it came to electing Muslims to Congress, calling it a \"different story\" from the presidency that \"depends on who that Muslim is and what their policies are, just as it depends on what anybody else says.\", Congress has two Muslim members, Democratic Reps. Keith Ellison of Minnesota and Andre Carson of Indiana. , \"If theres somebody whos of any faith, but they say things, and their life has been consistent with things that will elevate this nation and make it possible for everybody to succeed, and bring peace and harmony, then Im with them,\" Carson said. , ", "Date": "20150920", "Title": "[GOP candidate Carson: Muslim shouldn't be elected president]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/GOP-candidate-Carson-Muslims-shouldn-t-be-6517236.php", "Author": "[Hope Yen, Associated Press]"}

And Jeb Bush is still trying to distinguish himself from his famous brother and father. , Donald Trump, meanwhile, is stoking flames over immigration policy that are fueling his campaign for now, but also risk consuming it. And other Republican candidates are finding their own messages knocked off-kilter as theyre forced to respond to Trumps ideas. , The current distractions for Clinton and Bush are inevitable to some extent, but also partly their own making. , For two such well-known candidates, the getting-to-know-you phase of the campaign requires a healthy dose of new ideas, says GOP pollster David Winston. , Absent something new, \"the story line tends to drift to the negative,\" says Winston, and that trend is particularly pronounced in a time of general voter dissatisfaction with political discourse and the direction of the country. Neither candidate was able to keep from drifting off course, he says. , Once news emerged early on that Clinton had used a private email account and server as secretary of state, the not-yet-announced candidate knew shed have to deal with the consequences. But her campaign miscalculated the staying power of the issue and the various investigations it would spawn. , Clintons low-key campaign launch, in which she did more listening than talking, didnt do anything to quell the swirling controversy. And her subsequent attempts to change the subject to topics like her economic and education proposals came too late to contain the damage. , Now, the clearly frustrated candidate is trying everything from humor to fact-checks to put the issue to rest. Shes blaming government bureaucrats, GOP enemies and fixated reporters for what her campaign insists is an overblown emphasis on the matter. , A somewhat cocky Clinton joked during a speech earlier this month about getting a Snapchat account, saying, \"I love it. Those messages disappear all by themselves.\", Four days later, pressed on the email issue by reporters in Las Vegas, Clinton threw up her arms and declared, \"Nobody talks to me about it other than you guys.\", Dan Schnur, director of the University of Southern Californias political institute, says Clinton seemed to be relying, at least initially, on an old playbook. , \"The lesson that the Clintons learned in the 1990s is that its not necessary to immediately make all information available, and if you wait long enough, the tables eventually turn,\" Schnur said. \"So even if there are a lot of smart people sitting at her campaign table telling her otherwise, human nature is going to influence her to try to duplicate a past success.\", Bush, for his part, knew from the beginning that hed need to distinguish himself from his father and brothers presidencies. , He had an \"I-am-my-own-man\" answer practiced and ready to go. , Yet he still managed to fumble questions about whether hed have invaded Iraq as his brother did. And his turns of phrase about \"evil-doers\" and the burdens of presidential decision-making clearly echo those of his brother George W. Bush, undercutting his efforts to distinguish himself. , In both Clinton and Bushs cases, says Schnur, no matter how hard campaigns try to anticipate challenges and be ready for them, \"It always sounds better at campaign headquarters than it does out on the trail.\", \"Its not that hard to sit in a conference room and strategize about how to handle a potential problem,\" Schnur said. \"The problem is the other candidates and the media and the voters dont always react to that strategy the way you want them to.\", While Clinton and Bush keep trying out new tactics to stow their unwanted baggage, Trump shows no inclination to move past the political flashpoint of immigration, even though some of his comments have been criticized by Republicans as well as Democrats. , Trump seems happy to tap into a subset of voter disquiet, and to force GOP rivals to take a stand on proposals such as his call for a giant wall on the southern border and to deny automatic \"birthright citizenship\" to anyone born in the U.S. , For now, thats helping him \"ride a wave having to do with his chutzpah,\" says University of Texas political scientist Bruce Buchanan. But ultimately, Buchanan says, it could be a big problem for his candidacy and Republicans overall. , You can bet the party that vowed to make nice with Hispanics after the GOPs poor showing with Latino voters in 2012 didnt aim for its candidates to spend August talking about \"anchor babies.\", For all of the candidates, much of whats being talked about in August 2015 could well be largely forgotten by the time people cast votes next year. , But this summertime chatter is sure to contribute to the overall impressions of candidates that voters are developing. , \"Its shaping the context for how voters make their decisions,\" says Winston. \"You dont want the initial thought in everybodys mind to be, Wow, they have a lot of baggage.\", ", "Date": "20150824", "Title": "[Top candidates struggle with distractions from the past]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Top-candidates-struggle-with-distractions-from-6461332.php", "Author": "[Nancy Benac, Associated Press]"}

Were in uncharted territory.\", Trump may have had a lackluster performance in Wednesdays debate, but hes proved every prediction of his campaigns demise to be premature. Often, hes emerged from such moments with stronger support. , Even if Trump does falter in the coming weeks, several dozen Republicans interviewed by The Associated Press after the latest debate said no candidate is positioned to seize control if theres a void atop the unruly Republican field. , Jeb Bush cannot escape stubborn and strong skepticism from conservatives. On Friday night, the former Florida governor stuck by his support for the Common Core education standards, and drew boos from a crowd of thousands in South Carolina. , Scott Walker has been knocked from his top-tier status. For the Wisconsin governor, the campaign focus is squarely on Iowa. \"Maybe not enough sizzle,\" said Daniel McCabe, a 65-year-old Republican from Stamford, Connecticut. , Former technology executive Carly Fiorina is emerging after a strong debate performance. But for now, she lacks the money and organization for the lengthy campaign most expect. , \"I think that theres interest in hearing new ideas because the old havent been working,\" said Gwen Ecklund, the GOP head in Iowas Crawford County. \"People are really still all over the board.\", Trumps rivals say the debate, before a television audience of 23 million, did little to reshuffle the 16-candidate field. But they contend it was pivotal in exposing Trumps vulnerabilities, most notably his glaringly undeveloped policy positions. , \"I have big problems with his lack of interest in learning about the job of being president of the United States,\" Bush told Fox News. \"This is a big, serious job and you have to have the skills necessary to lead.\", Steve Munisteri, an adviser to Kentucky Sen. Rand Pauls campaign, likened Trumps debate performance to a long-running television show on the brink of cancellation. , \"He never really gives any specifics, so most of his appeal is kind of reality talk show entertainment,\" Munisteri said. \"Its the same old shtick every time.\", On Friday, Trump released just his second policy paper, posting to his website a statement outlining his support for expansive gun rights. Thats a stand on which there is almost no disagreement in the Republican Party. , With four more debates before the Iowa caucuses Feb. 1, the party establishment wing is banking on Trumps policy gaps becoming more troublesome as the first voting nears. , For Robert Morse, a 67-year-old Republican who attended a Trump town hall meeting Thursday in New Hampshire, the candidates vague prescriptions for addressing the nations problems are cause for concern. , \"Well, he hasnt been real definite about that, has he?\" Morse said. \"If hes going to really be in the running, hes got to start putting down real facts that people want to hear about.\", Trumps rivals were also heartened by signs that the businessman known for his sharp barbs sometimes flinched when criticism came his way. , For some, it validated their decision to engage Trump in the second debate rather than continue with the hands-off approach most took throughout the summer. , In post-debate calls with donors and other supporters, Bush advisers singled out his defense of his brother, former President George W. Bush, when Trump challenged his record. \"You know what? As it relates to my brother, theres one thing I know for sure: he kept us safe,\" Bush said to cheers from the audience at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California on Wednesday night. , After that exchange, Bushs team noted, Trump went silent for 37 straight minutes. , The most blistering onstage rebuke of Trump came from Fiorina, the former CEO at Hewlett-Packard. Asked about Trumps attempt to explain away his insults about her looks, Fiorina said simply, \"I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.\", That Fiorina was even on the stage was a triumph of an establishment eager to showcase the only woman in the GOP race. , With the implicit backing of GOP officials, Fiorinas campaign lobbied debate host CNN to change the participation criteria to allow her to participate despite her low poll numbers. , While many question her ultimate viability, the businesswoman is viewed as a powerful political weapon in the GOPs push to court women, particularly in a 2016 contest that features Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton. , Fiorina, Bush and several other candidates followed the debate with appearances at Republican gatherings in South Carolina and Michigan. Trump was scheduled to attend the South Carolina event, but pulled out Friday, citing a \"significant business transaction.\", It was the second eyebrow-raising moment for Trump on the heels of the debate.

Governor elect Dan Patrick after being sworn in as Speaker of the House during the opening of the 2015 Legislature at the State Capitol on January 13, 2015. , AUSTIN - Just days after state lawmakers signaled they hoped to move past political jockeying and work together on key policy priorities, House Republicans issued a letter directly to the Texas taxpayer arguing their tax relief plan was far better than what the Senate is proposing. , \"Dear Taxpayer,\" reads the letter, which was signed by 90 of the 98 members of the House Republican Caucus. \"As conservative leaders in the Texas House, we write to you today to present to you why we support the House tax cut package authored by Rep. Dennis Bonnen, and why we think it is the most powerful plan for tax relief.\", The Senates $4.4 billion tax plan proposes handing property owners a bigger homestead exemption, while the House has pledged to cut the sales tax rate from 6.25 percent to 5.95 percent. In the Saturday letter, House Republicans argue their plan is the larger than the Senates (at around $4.9 billion) and would be better for all Texans since it would be permanent and would benefit not just property owners. , The letter also argued the sales tax cut plan is the more fiscally conservative choice. , \"Another attractive feature of the House plan is that it shrinks the size of government instead of shifting it. Unlike property tax cuts, which cost the state budget and grow in cost with time, the sales tax reduction simply means the state collects less,\" the letter reads. \"We came to Austin to shrink government, not shift the burden from local government to the state.\", The missive adds House Republicans \"look forward\" to working with Senate leaders on a comprehensive tax cut plan. But the sheer act of issuing the letter serves to once again draw a clear line in the sand between the two chambers, a line that could serve to further inflame tensions and lead to stalled legislative priorities in the last few weeks of the 2015 session. , Eight Republicans did not sign the letter: House Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio, Gary Elkins of Houston, GilbertPea of Pasadena, Matt Rinaldi of Irving, Mike Schofield of Katy, David Simpson of Longview, Jonathan Stickland of Bedford and John Smithee of Amarillo. , While there is always a competitive relationship between the House and the Senate, tensions are running especially high this year with Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick seeking to cement his leadership and live up to his promise to bring a \"new day\" to Texas. , This political wrangling reached a boiling point last Wednesday, when Gov. Greg Abbott had words with Patrick at a weekly leadership breakfast also attended by Straus. Abbott was upset his \"quality pre-kindergarten\" legislation - a House bill thats already passed the lower chamber - was called \"socialistic\" and \"godless\" by a group of tea party leaders Patrick appointed to advise him on policy. , By weeks end, Patrick insisted the Senate was working with the House to address differences of opinion. The pre-K bill, and a number of other House proposals, was referred to Senate committees and detente seemed imminent, at least from the upper chamber. , But Saturdays letter served to bring to an end this brief kumbaya moment, forecasting a stormy last few weeks before sine die.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay), AUSTIN - State senators are likely to pass Gov. Greg Abbotts \"gold standard\" pre-kindergarten legislation into law, but not before the chambers far-right conservatives make clear they question its necessity. , On Thursday, the Senate Public Education Committee approved House Bill 4 by Dan Huberty, R-Houston, an Abbott-backed bill that would funnel $130 million to certain pre-K programs that meet additional quality benchmarks based on teacher training levels, child improvement measures and more. , The legislation sailed through the House, passing unanimously in committee and by an overwhelming marginon the floor. The legislation has received a chillier reception in the Senate, especially from lawmakers and activists who align themselves with the tea party. , On Thursday, Sen. Donna Campbell, R-New Braunfels, succeeded in touting the Abbott bill, as well as ripping the concept of full-day pre-K as untested and lacking in fiscal responsibility. As a sophomore lawmaker who once advocated for shifting pre-K money to K-12 education, Campbell seemed an unlikely choice to shepherd the bill through the Senate. , In fact, veteran lawmaker Judith Zaffirini was the odds-on choice for the job - and, she said, the governors choice - before Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick chose Campbell to be the Senate sponsor. Patrick already has a fraught history with the bill, however, having had to distance himself from a scathing review his \"grass-roots\" advisors released calling it \"socialistic\" and \"Godless.\", Educators who spoke before the Senate panel on Thursday were much more positive. , Houston Independent School District Superintendent Terry Grier said \"I cant think of anything youve done since Ive been in this state that is this important,\" while Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo in written testimony called high-quality pre-K \"one of our most most important crime prevention tools.\", HB4 does not expand existing state-sponsored pre-k, which is offered currently just to four-year-olds from homeless, military and non-native English speaking families. In the House committee, most lawmakers discussed the positive impact full-day pre-K would have in Texas, if not for insurmountable political and fiscal barriers. , The bill was approved by a vote of 9-2.

Todd Courser and Cindy Gamrat said Monday that he was rebuffed when he confronted them about having an \"inappropriate physical relationship.\", Joshua Cline said at a news conference in the Detroit suburb of Royal Oak that during a late-night staff meeting in January, he confronted the two first-term lawmakers, who shared staffers in an unusual arrangement. , \"I began to suspect ... they were having an inappropriate physical relationship (and said) they should stop and enforce personal boundaries,\" Cline said. \"They quickly dismissed my concerns. They said such a suggestion was not my place.\", The Republican lawmakers, who took office with tea party backing, have apologized for having an extramarital affair with one another. Courser admitted that he orchestrated a smear campaign against himself in which he had an email sent to Republican supporters from an anonymous account accusing him of having had sex with a male prostitute. Courser said he did so to distract attention from the actual affair, which he feared was about to become public. , In a long audio statement Courser recently released, he said Cline, who quit in April, and other former aides tried to \"blackmail\" him to resign. He said the self-directed smear campaign also was an attempt to try and disrupt those who were blackmailing him. , Courser, 43, and Gamrat, 42, are the subjects of a state House investigation into whether they misused public resources to hide their relationship and fired another aide for refusing to help. Neither lawmaker plans to quit and Gamrat has denied a role in the cover-up. , Cline said Courser and Gamrat spent \"inordinate amounts of time going for walks,\" and \"greeted with long, personal embraces.\" He added that Courser often would take naps on Gamrats office floor, and \"upon seeing him, Gamrat would tuck him in with a pillow and blanket.\", Cline, who described Courser as a \"close, personal\" friend from before his 2014 election, said he shared his concerns with the office of GOP House Speaker Kevin Cotter \"when I felt there was no relief coming.\", \"I respect ... the state legislative branch,\" Cline said. \"I hope to help them discover all of the details of this unfortunate circumstance.\", The Detroit News broke the story earlier this month, citing secret audio recordings and texts provided by former staffer Ben Graham, as well as interviews with Graham, Cline and others. The newspaper documented at least one meeting at Gamrats official office in which she, Courser and Graham discussed the affair, and it noted that Courser missed a committee meeting during that time. , The Michigan State Police opened an investigation Friday after Courser, on his own accord, visited the Lapeer post to speak with an investigator. \"We have not detailed what we are investigating,\" spokeswoman Shanon Banner said. , ", "Date": "20150818", "Title": "[Embattled lawmakers' ex-aide: I confronted them about affair]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Embattled-lawmakers-ex-aide-I-confronted-them-6449168.php", "Author": "[Jeff Karoub, Associated Press]"}

Harper blamed low oil prices for the slumping economy. , Analysts say the election is a toss-up and Harpers Conservative party faces an uphill battle to form another majority government in Parliament.  The election is Oct. 19. , Analysts say Mulcair and the opposition New Democrats have a chance to gain power for the first time after the party won control of the legislature in Alberta, Canadas most conservative province, a few months ago. , Trudeau has trailed in third place in recent polls after Harpers Conservatives have run repeated attack ads saying the 43-year-old is not ready for the job. , The vote on the left may split between the New Democrats and Liberals. The first televised debate was seen as a key test for Trudeau, the son of the man whose legacy Harper is trying to erase. , Former colleagues of Harper say his long-term goals are to kill the once widely entrenched notion that the Liberals  the party of long-time leaders Pierre Trudeau and Jean Chretien  are the natural party of government in Canada, and to redefine what it means to be Canadian. , Harper has managed to nudge a traditionally center-left country to the right since coming to power in 2006. He has gradually lowered sales and corporate taxes, avoided climate change legislation, supported the oil industry against the environmental lobby and increased military spending. He has also been a staunch supporter of Israel. , Nelson Wiseman, a University of Toronto political science professor, said Harper performed well in the debate despite repeated attacks and will hold onto his base support. , Few Canadians likely watched the debate. It wasnt broadcast on the major networks and was held just five days into the campaign. Harper called the election in the dead of summer last Sunday, triggering an unusual 11-week federal campaign rather than the usual five-week campaign. The campaign will be the longest in Canada since 1872, but each party has been unofficially campaigning for months.]", "Date": "20150807", "Title": "[PM admits Canada may be in recession in election debate]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/article/PM-admits-Canada-may-be-in-recession-in-election-6430296.php", "Author": "[Rob Gillies, Associated Press]"}

Parker had instead argued it was proper to vote for or against repealing the measure, and the council approved language with that approach Aug. 5. , \"Though the ordinance is controversial, the law governing the City Councils duties is clear.

{"Content": "[ Caption, Close, More than 60 percent of Texans support an online voter registration system, according to recent polling by the Pew Charitable Trusts. ( J. Patric Schneider / For the Chronicle ), If you want to know the priorities of Harris County Tax Assessor-Collector Mike Sullivan, just go to his 2012 campaign website and click the issues tab. The first item on his list: \"Bring the office into the 21st century by embracing new technology.\", We have no reason to doubt Sullivan, but were perplexed as to why he has opposed a bill that would allow online voter registration in the state of Texas (\"Online voter registration bill derailed,\" Page B1, Monday). Twenty other states currently allow registering online, and six others recently approved laws that have not yet taken effect. At this point it is hardly a new technology. Tested time and again across the nation, in red states and blue, the results of online registration have been overwhelmingly positive. Online systems save money, reduce fraud and make it easier for citizens to register before elections. , Maricopa County, Ariz. , which is home to Phoenix and Mesa, reported back in 2008 that online voter registration saved data entry costs equivalent to eight full-time employees. And the California Secretary of State reported in 2013 that online voter registration saved the states taxpayers about $2 million. Texans should be joining these states. Instead, were stuck funding an outdated, inefficient system. , Like a leery grandmother who doesnt trust email, Sullivan testified in Austin that Texas simply isnt ready for online registration. This circumspect attitude hasnt stopped his office from accepting payments online, nor has it prevented the state of Texas from allowing people to use the Internet to renew drivers licenses or apply for and renew concealed handgun licenses. , Perhaps if folks punched their ballots with a bullet, Sullivan would get onboard. Instead, he raises the evidence-free specter of potential fraud, despite the fact that there have been zero reported instances of fraud due to online registration in other states. In fact, online systems can actually help catch errors by fixing the problems of illegible handwriting and incomplete forms. , Theres a reason why online voter registration is supported by groups like Houston Young Republicans, Harris County Young Democrats, the Texas Association of Election Administration, the National Republican Lawyers Association and the Tax Assessor-Collectors Association of Texas. , If Sullivan can see problems on the road to implementing this system, then he should step up as Tax Assessor-Collector and fix them. , \"We have a responsibility to register people,\" Sullivan told the Houston Chronicle editorial board during the 2012 Republican Party primary. \"Voter registration is really what its all about.\", It was that sort of can-do attitude that won him that primary race over Don Sumners, who had been criticized for his lackluster management and conflicts with the League of Women Voters. , \"The customers always right,\" Sullivan said at the time, drawing a contrast with the incumbent. , Today those customers want online voter registration.

The National Labor Relations Board on Monday, Aug. 17, 2015, overturned a historic ruling that gave Northwestern University football players the go-ahead to form the nations first college athletes union, saying the prospect of union and non-union teams could throw off the competitive balance in college football. , SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP)  With or without a union, more rights and benefits are coming for college athletes. , Whether the NCAA schools that compete in big-time athletics can provide enough to keep at bay more ominous threats to college sports remains to be seen. Even the failed attempt to unionize the Northwestern University football players could be viewed as progress for those still pushing reform. , \"I certainly dont think this is the end of this type of discussion,\" said David Ridpath, a professor of sports administration at Ohio University and president-elect of the Drake Group, a watchdog group for college sports. \"And certainly regardless of what happens, this has energized the athletes rights movement for years to come.\", The National Labor Relations Board on Monday blocked a historic bid by Northwestern football players to form the nations first college athletes union. , In a unanimous decision, the board said the prospect of union and nonunion teams in college could lead to different standards at schools  from how much money players receive to how much time they practice  and create competitive imbalances on the field. , The new ruling annuls a 2014 decision by a regional NLRB director in Chicago who said scholarship football players are employees under U.S. law and thus entitled to organize. But Mondays decision did not directly address the question of whether the players are employees, which allowed the organizers of the movement to claim it was only a setback and not a total defeat. , \"The doors not closed,\" said Ramogi Huma, a former UCLA football player and executive director of the advocacy group, the National College Players Association. , In explaining its ruling, the board said the biggest factor was the NLRBs jurisdiction, which extends only to private schools such as Northwestern and Notre Dame. The board repeatedly cited the need for standardized rules and policies in sports. Collective bargaining rights for one team would disrupt that uniformity. Public universities are subject to state labor laws. , Huma and former Northwestern quarterback Kain Colter, who became the face of the union movement, said the bid to unionize helped advance NCAA reforms such as extended long-term health coverage for athletes, guaranteed four-year scholarships and the removal of restrictions on meals for athletes. Starting this school year, universities can begin paying stipends worth several thousands of dollars to college athletes to cover cost-of-attendance expenses beyond tuition, books and room and board. , Many in college sports have been pushing these reforms for years. , \"Some of the changes that have been adopted were items that were on the Southeastern Conference agenda before the unionization effort was identified,\" SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey told The Associated Press by phone. \"But certainly as weve dealt with the external issues, the litigation and this, its increased awareness to the extent there is an interest or desire in sharing credit. OK, but were going to continue to focus on how we improve the support for our student-athletes. , \"Thats really been our focus from the beginning of the conversation, probably going back to 2010 or so.\", Conference leaders have said they would like to decrease the time demands on athletes, give them more flexibility when making the decision to turn professional and provide more continuing education and health care. Some administrators have suggested that compensating athletes for the use of their names, images and likenesses would be reasonable. , Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick told the AP he never felt unionization was a serious threat to college sports, especially compared to the legal challenges facing the NCAA and its member schools. , \"Well never know, but I would have thought it likely that if the ballots were ever opened we would have found out the unionization effort probably failed,\" he said. , Last years ruling against the NCAA in the Ed OBannon case, which would allow schools to pay athletes thousands of dollars for the use of their likenesses, is in the process of being appealed. Another case working its way through the court system challenges the rights of schools to cap compensation at the cost of a scholarship. The NCAA and individual member schools are facing numerous lawsuits by former college athletes over treatment of concussions. There is also the possibility of congressional intervention in college sports. , Oklahoma offensive lineman Ty Darlington, who was part of a new student delegation that voted on NCAA legislation at the last convention, said he doesnt believe the majority of athletes want to unionize  but that wont stop reform. , \"I feel like we need to work within the system that we have to get the changes accomplished that we need to get accomplished,\" he said. , ", "Date": "20150819", "Title": "[Failed union bid won't stop reforms in college athletics]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/article/Failed-union-bid-won-t-stop-reforms-in-college-6449988.php", "Author": "[Ralph D.

City Council approved sending the equal rights ordinance to voters on Wednesday, under order from the Texas Supreme Court to either repeal the law or affirm it and place it on the November ballot. , Then, City Council tackled the ballot language. Attorney Andy Taylor, who represents the opponents, told City Council he believed City Charter does not allow for a suspended ordinance -- the law has been tabled, under court order -- to be voted on by repeal. , The current ballot language asks \"shall the city of Houston repeal the Equal Rights Ordinance\" -- so a supporter of the law would vote against it, and an opponent would vote in favor. , In a press release, Taylor said the \"Mayor decided to play games with the language in an effort to confuse voters on the effect of a Yes or No vote.\", Taylor has submitted an emergency mandamus relief request to the Texas Supreme Court. In order to meet a late August deadline for ballot items, City Council has only one meeting left to re-vote on the language if ordered to do so. , Mayor Annise Parker did not respond to a request for comment but on the Houston Matters radio show Friday afternoon she said the lawsuit lacked merit. The language, she noted, was taken from a repeal referendum petition opponents submitted last summer. , \"They apparently dont trust the voters to figure out how to read do you want to repeal, yes or no,\" Parker said. \"This is a frustrating situation for me but I know that we are following the law in the city of Houston.\", The equal rights ordinance bans discrimination based not just on sexual orientation and gender identity - the flash points for opponents - but also, as federal laws do, sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status. , The ordinance applies to businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting. Religious institutions are exempt. Violators can be fined up to $5,000. , Conservative opponents submitted a petition to send the law to voters last summer, but city officials rejected it, saying it was riddled with errors and did not contain the needed 17,269 valid signatures from Houston residents. That triggered a lawsuit from opponents and the subsequent district court and Supreme Court rulings. , On Monday, opponents again filed suit against Parker, seeking unspecified court costs and other damages associated with the earlier lawsuit. Three pastors also are suing Parker for damages and legal costs incurred when the city, as part of a broad discovery request, issued subpoenas that included a demand for certain sermons. Those subpoenas eventually were pulled down amid significant backlash.]", "Date": "20150807", "Title": "[Equal rights ordinance foes sue mayor over ballot language]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/houston/article/Equal-rights-ordinance-opponents-sue-mayor-over-6431037.php", "Author": "[By Katherine Driessen]"}

Meanwhile, people waiting for trial lose their jobs, government budgets swell and society suffers. ( Johnny Hanson / Houston Chronicle ), Want to know the best way to stay out of Harris County Jail? Dont be poor. , Our criminal justice system is supposed to presume that people are innocent until proven guilty, yet being free of a criminal conviction wont keep you out of Harris County Jail. About 6,600 people, or 75 percent of inmates, in that fetid tower of cold concrete are merely biding time before trial. The problem isnt that theyre criminals, the problem is that cant afford a bail bond. So rather than going home to their families and jobs, folks accused of crimes have to sit behind bars until their day in court. , This system doesnt make anyone safer, but it does cost a pretty penny. As Chronicle reporter Brian Rogers wrote last week, each one of those inmates costs taxpayers about $45 a day. , It is a problem practically unique to Harris County. Courthouses throughout Texas and across the nation routinely grant personal recognizance bonds for folks accused of nonviolent crimes. These so-called signature bonds allow people to go about their normal lives while they wait for their trial date. The courthouses Pretrial Services already has the ability to determine which people wont be flight risks - folks with regular employment or community ties, for example. In fact, according to University of Houston law professor Sandra Guerra Thompson, we could reduce the jail population by 67 percent overnight simply by implementing this well-tested personal recognizance policy. , Criminal court judges have the ability to implement this change today, but they likely wont. Why?, \"I can only assume they are receiving pressure from bond companies,\" state Sen. John Whitmire, chair of the Senate Criminal Justice Committee, told the Chronicle editorial board. , Bail bondsmen are some of the few interested parties who have a direct stake in judicial elections, and the notoriously low turnout for those bottom of the ballot races makes them easy to influence. More bail bonds means more business for these criminal justice profiteers, and elections provide plenty of opportunities to reward friendly judges. So while they rake it in, taxpayers get the bill. , Now, due to jail overcrowding, taxpayers also have to fund profiteers of another kind - a private jail in Beaumont (\"Sheriff shipping inmates from jail,\" Page A1, Wednesday). It is a mystery why recently appointed Sheriff Ron Hickman chose to put inmates on a bus heading east instead of working with the Harris County Criminal Justice Coordinating Committee to find available beds in the public system. Hickman blamed the lack of space on recent floods, but it looks to us more like a management problem. Rather than focusing on the underlying problems that cause jail overcrowding, our new sheriff seems content going back to the bad, old days, when we routinely sent inmates and money into the private prison industry. , People who are in jail simply because they cant afford a bond become commodities for these prisons, which lobby long and hard to make sure that their beds are filled with publicly-funded bodies. Meanwhile, people waiting for trial lose their jobs, government budgets swell and society suffers. , It is the job of our courts to distinguish the guilty from the innocent, but right now were doing a better job of separating the wealthy from the poor.]", "Date": "20150703", "Title": "[Editorial: Jailing the poor]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/editorials/article/Jailing-the-poor-6364295.php", "Author": "[Copyright 2015: Houston Chronicle]"}

The government has offered a $3.8 million reward for Guzmans capture, double the amount it usually offers for the countrys most wanted criminals. AFP PHOTO/ Yuri CORTEZYURI CORTEZ/AFP/Getty Images, Less than two months after the PRI gained a marginal victory in Mexicos midterm elections, the administration of Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto has been hit by two stinging setbacks. , First was the humiliating escape of Joaqun \"El Chapo\" Guzman, the head of the infamous Sinaloa Cartel, and soon after was the energy reforms less than stellar first bidding round. All is not lost on either front, but moving forward will require a dramatic change of tone and direction on security measures, and serious recalibration on the energy side. , On July 11, El Chapo slipped through a tunnel in his maximum-security cell and emerged as a free man some 1.5 kilometers away. The shocking escape rocked the country (and the world) and underscored the extent to which corruption permeates even the top and supposedly most secure parts of Mexicos security establishment. It also brings to light the issue of why El Chapo was sitting in that prison in the first place. Especially as U.S. officials had formally filed an extradition request less than three weeks before his escape. , Carin Zissis of the Americas Society/Council of the Americas recently wrote about how extradition may be the Mexican governments most effective tool for fighting the cartels. Yet, since El Chapos capture 18 months ago, the bilateral cooperation on this front has waned. Of course, the security relationship between the United States and Mexico extends well beyond this singular issue. That said, the escape threatens to put our bilateral collaboration on less certain ground. , As the nation reeled from El Chapos disappearing act, the government turned in an underwhelming performance in the countrys first energy auction. July 14 marked the bidding day for 14 shallow-water blocks up for exploration, and while interest among major energy companies had been high in the lead-up, only six of the blocks received any bids at all. Of these, two fields received bids that surpassed the governments minimum fiscal requirements. This meant that only two fields were assigned (a 14 percent success rate), falling short of the governments own 30 to 50 percent benchmark for measuring success. , The reasons behind this lackluster performance are likely a combination of low global oil prices, concern over elements of the governments production-sharing contracts, the fields small size and geological considerations. On a positive note, the bidding round itself was highly transparent and efficient and the actual process of running a tender went off without a hitch. The government will certainly want to repeat this smooth process for future rounds, but it will need to aggressively review all commercial terms to make sure they are as attractive as possible for future investors. , Since El Chapos quick apprehension and extradition is unlikely, what the government should do is immediately shift toward a serious, long-term and sustained commitment to building the countrys rule of law. Even bold steps and a strong policy agenda may very well be too little too late for regaining Mexicans frayed trust in their government, but are absolutely critical to maintaining investor confidence going forward. At this point this is not only the best path, but also the only one worth pursuing. , , Garza (@aogarza) is a former U.S. Ambassador to Mexico and is counsel in the Mexico City office of White & Case.]", "Date": "20150727", "Title": "[Garza: Wanted: Bold Steps and Rule of Law]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Garza-Wanted-Bold-Steps-and-Rule-of-Law-6408373.php", "Author": "[By Antonio Garza]"}

The president is returning to Washington after he and his family spent more than two weeks vacationing on the Massachusetts island of Marthas Vineyard. , WASHINGTON (AP)  President Barack Obama may have finally shed his summer curse  just in time for a daunting fall. , Unlike past summers, this years has been among the most productive stretches of Obamas presidency. Late June victories in the Supreme Court on health care and gay marriage, along with a win for his trade agenda on Capitol Hill, were followed by the landmark Iran nuclear deal in July and the raising of the U.S. flag over a new embassy in Cuba in August. , Instead of being overshadowed by the 2016 presidential campaign, Obamas agenda has often been driving the debate among the candidates running to replace him. , And yet to the president, one of his summers biggest successes may simply be making it through his annual vacation on the tony Massachusetts island of Marthas Vineyard largely uninterrupted. While his summer troubles have often trailed him on previous vacations, he closed out this years trip Sunday without any statements to the press or public appearances, beyond a few glimpses of him on the golf course and biking with his family. , \"The president has absolutely appreciated the opportunity to take these two weeks outside of the hustle and bustle of Washington and spend some time with family and friends,\" White House spokesman Eric Schultz said. \"Once we return to Washington, our agenda is packed, so the president is grateful for some rest and relaxation in advance of what will be a very busy fall.\", Indeed, the president returned to Washington Sunday with a full schedule and confrontations with Congress that will help determine whether his summer momentum is sustained or sputters. , Atop the presidents priorities is preventing Congress from blocking the Iran deal, which curbs Tehrans nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars in sanctions relief. Obama will likely have to veto a resolution of disapproval by lawmakers, blemishing his signature foreign policy initiative, but he appears on track to garner enough support from Democrats to hold off Republican override efforts. , Obama is also hoping to avoid the second government shutdown of his presidency. Some conservative Republicans have threatened to hold up funding bills to keep the government open after Oct. 1 unless federal money for Planned Parenthood is cut. , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. , has dismissed the prospect of a shutdown, saying \"Weve been down this path before.\" Still, the issue has spilled into the 2016 presidential campaign, which will likely intensify the debate over linking government funding to the womens health organization. , Seeking to bolster his legacy abroad, Obama will also be pushing for a global climate treaty and finalization of a free trade agreement with Asia-Pacific nations. His string of summer successes began with Congress agreeing to a fast-track approval process for the trade pact when negotiations are complete. , September also holds a White House meeting with Pope Francis, a state visit for Chinese President Xi Jinping, where Beijings high-profile hacking will be on the agenda, and the presidents annual trip to New York for the United Nations General Assembly. , For Obama, now deep in his second term, a busy, high-stakes agenda sure beats the alternative. His presidency appeared to be quickly slipping into lame-duck territory last year, but began to rebound after Democrats defeats in the midterm election and picked up momentum this summer. , Summer has previously been Obamas cruelest season: the hostile health care town halls in 2009, the debt ceiling crisis in 2011, the presidents waffling on Syrias chemical weapons use in 2013. Last summer was consumed by the swift rise of the Islamic State and the groups gruesome beheading of Americans, as well as tensions in Ferguson, Missouri, after a white police officer fatally shot an 18-year-old black man. , Free this year from an all-consuming crisis, the president spent most of the two-week summer vacation on the golf course, at the beach and dining out with his family. He also attended a party on the island thrown by Democratic power broker Vernon Jordan, who also hosted an event last year where Obama was spotted on the dance floor. , But there were no images of Obama dancing this year. Perhaps in a sign that even a president riding high in his second term has a short shelf life, the band instead posted a video of a dancing Hillary Rodham Clinton, the top contender to be the next Democratic president. , ", "Date": "20150824", "Title": "[Obama sheds summer curse, just in time for daunting fall]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Obama-sheds-summer-curse-just-in-time-for-6461368.php", "Author": "[Julie Pace, Ap White House Correspondent]"}

He was especially blistering on immigration, an emotional issue that has roiled the GOP. , \"This whole anti-immigrant sentiment thats out there in our politics right now is contrary to who we are,\" Obama said during a town hall at Des Moines North High School. , Officially, Obama came to Iowa to announce plans to let aspiring college students apply for federal financial aid earlier. But from the start of his question-and-answer session, it was clear the election was on his mind. , \"I know you guys are all about to be flooded with ads and calls from a bunch of folks who want this job,\" Obama said in his opening remarks. He jokingly added, \"I just cant imagine what kind of person would put themselves through something like that.\", Asked by one participant for his views on the 2016 candidates education policies, Obama said he wouldnt tell anyone who to vote for  \"at least not right now; later I will.\", Still, he criticized congressional Republicans for wanting to keep broad domestic budget cuts in place and urged voters not to back candidates who blame teachers for problems in education, a slap at Republicans who have fought teachers unions, A young woman volunteering for Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, tried to pull Obama into his own partys primary fight. She asked the president whether he thought a proposal from Clintons top challenger, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, to make education at public universities free was realistic. , Without mentioning Sanders, Obama plugged his own proposal for free tuition at two-year community colleges. If that can be accomplished, Obama said, \"then I think we can start building from there.\", The presidents comments on immigration came in response to a student who asked whether young people in the U.S. illegally qualified for financial aid. Obama said the idea that young people brought to the U.S. illegally should not be welcome if they want to contribute to their communities makes no sense. , Most Republicans running for president oppose providing a path to citizenship to those living in the U.S. illegally.

Iowa voters carried Obama to a surprise victory over Hillary Rodham Clinton in the 2008 Democratic caucuses. He returned to the state on the eve of the 2012 election for his final rally as a candidate, an emotional event that drew 20,000 supporters. , Even in a state flooded with candidates seeking to carve out their own legacy, Obamas advisers know that a presidential visit  with the spectacle of an Air Force One arrival and a big motorcade speeding through the city  still garners attention. , Republicans hoping to replace Obama certainly noticed. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio wrote an op-ed article in Mondays Des Moines Register about his own higher education plans, saying he would reform the college accreditation system and bring down tuition costs by allowing new schools to compete with traditional institutions. , Rubio said Obamas education policies, including his proposal for free community college, only \"double-down on Washingtons failed strategy of spending more taxpayer money on the same outdated model.\", The president didnt meet with any presidential candidates while in Iowa. Still, he was joined by White House political strategy director David Simas, who typically joins Obama on travel involving campaign fundraisers or other overtly political events. , For Obama, keeping a Democrat in the White House could be crucial to the longevity of many of the actions hes taken while in office. Stymied by Congress, hes wielded his executive power to implement changes to immigration and energy policies, among other issues. He also acted alone to re-establish diplomatic relations with Cuba and will leave the next president a non-binding nuclear agreement with Iran. , By acting on his own authority so often, hes risked having many of his policies wiped away or reversed by a future president. Several candidates vying for the Republican nomination have vowed to pull out of the Iran deal, upend the Affordable Care Act and end some Obama immigration policies. , Obama hasnt endorsed any of the Democratic contenders, though hes said Clinton  his former rival-turned ally  would make an excellent president.

The president is mandating even steeper greenhouse gas cuts from U.S. power plants than previously expected, while granting states more time and broader options to comply. , WASHINGTON (AP)  President Barack Obamas sweeping new power plant regulations are thrusting the divisive debate over climate change into the race for the White House, with candidates in both parties seeing an opportunity to capitalize. , To Democrats, rallying around global climate change is a way to energize liberal supporters and paint Republicans as out of touch with the majority of Americans. To the GOP, Obamas executive actions to curb greenhouse gas emissions are burdensome to business and block job creation, an argument targeting Americans worries about the economy. , The president unveiled the plan at the White House Monday, calling it the \"single most important step\" the U.S. has taken to combat a major global threat. , Broad support for the rules by Democratic candidates and universal opposition from Republicans puts the parties eventual nominees on a general-election collision course. Most of the changes Obama outlined would have to be implemented by the next president, if the rules survive court challenges. , Republicans gave little indication of what they would do differently to curb emissions from U.S. power plants, if anything at all. They cast the measure requiring states to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 32 percent by 2030 as unnecessary and costly White House overreach that will raise energy costs for Americans. , The Obama administration itself estimated the emissions limits will cost $8.4 billion annually by 2030, though the actual price wont be clear until states decide how they would reach their targets. , Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, said the regulations would be an economic \"buzz saw\" that would \"cost hard-working Americans jobs and raise their energy rates.\" Jeb Bush, the former GOP governor of Florida, said the rules \"run over state governments, will throw countless people out of work and increases everyones energy prices.\", Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz questioned whether climate change is really occurring. , \"Im saying the data and facts dont support it,\" Cruz said at a retreat sponsored by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, heavily courted donors who strongly oppose Obamas climate change agenda. , The issue has also fueled the fundraising race for Democrats. Billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer dropped $74 million into the 2014 midterm elections for candidates who support policies to curb climate change. Despite such spending, Democrats gave up control of the Senate, lost seats in the House and suffered embarrassing defeats in gubernatorial races. , Steyer hosted a fundraiser earlier this year for Hillary Rodham Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. Clinton called Obamas power plant measure a \"significant step forward\" and said she would defend it if elected president. Her Democratic challengers were similarly supportive. , Power plants account for roughly one-third of all U.S. emissions of the heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming, making them the largest single source. Obama has already used executive actions to curb greenhouse gas emissions from other major sources, including cars and trucks. , Building on Obamas aggressive actions, Democrats have cast climate change as one in a long list of issues  along with gay marriage, immigration and diplomatic relations with Cuba  where Republicans are out of step with the majority of Americans. A Washington Post/ABC News poll conducted in March showed 59 percent of Americans said theyd like the next president to be someone who favors government action to address climate change, while 31 percent would prefer someone who opposes it. , Dan Pfeiffer, a longtime Obama adviser, said climate change is also a \"litmus test\" for many of the young voters who backed the president in the 2008 and 2012 elections. Some Democrats fear Clinton, if she wins the nomination, will struggle to replicate the high turnout among young people and minorities that helped propel Obama into the White House. , \"They see candidates who deny the science as relics from the past not worthy of their support,\" said Pfeiffer, who left the White House earlier this year. \"Motivating the younger voters that were core to the Obama coalition will be one of the biggest tasks for the Democrats in 2016 and climate change is one the best issues to get them to the polls.\", According to the Washington Post/ABC News poll, 64 percent of adults between ages 18-39 said theyd prefer the next president to favor action to address climate change, compared with 49 percent of those over 65. However, an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs and Yale University poll late last year found that younger Americans didnt hold significantly different views from older Americans on government regulation of carbon dioxide emissions. , ", "Date": "20150806", "Title": "[Obama power plant rules spark 2016 fight over climate change]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/business/energy/article/Obama-power-plant-rules-spark-2016-fight-over-6422347.php", "Author": "[Julie Pace, Ap White House Correspondent]"}

Obama will sign an Executive Order requiring federal contractors to offer their employees up to seven days of paid sick leave per year. , BOSTON (AP)  Courting unions on Labor Day, President Barack Obama denounced Republicans for a \"constant attack on working Americans\" and said he was using his executive power to force federal contractors to give paid sick leave to their employees. , Obama was met with resounding applause at a major union rally and breakfast in Boston on Monday when he said he had signed the executive order aboard Air Force One as he flew in to mark Labor Day. He said Republicans who claim the mantle of middle-class protectors are talking big, but they \"have to walk the walk.\", Obama said opponents of his economic policies \"wont let facts or evidence get in their way.\", \"You just wait, you look up at the sky and prosperity will come raining down on us from the top of whatever high-rise in New York City,\" he said sarcastically. \"But thats not how the economy works.\" He added that the GOPs mindset has been \"wrecking the economy for a long, long time.\", The Labor Day gesture to workers groups came as Obama works to smooth over tensions with the labor movement over his trade agenda. Major unions are opposing Obamas push for sweeping new trade deals with Asia and Europe, with some threatening to work against Democrats who voted to support those talks in Congress. Unions have warned that the deals could lead to the widespread job elimination. Obama has signed a law providing money to retrain workers if their jobs get shipped overseas. , Under the executive order, employees working on federal contracts gain the right to a minimum of one hour of paid leave for every 30 hours they work. Stretched out over 12 months, thats up to seven days per year. The order will allow employees to use the leave to care for sick relatives as well, and will affect contracts starting in 2017 - just as Obama leaves office. , Business groups said Obamas order would make it harder for small businesses to retain federal contractors and could hinder economic growth. , \"Once again President Obama is using the federal procurement system to do something it was never been designed to do: usurp the legislative authority of Congress to determine appropriate workplace policies,\" said Randy Johnson, senior vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. , The White House wouldnt specify the cost to federal contractors to implement the executive order. The Labor Department said any costs would be offset by savings that contractors would see as a result of lower attrition rates and increased worker loyalty, but produced nothing to back that up. , Vice President Joe Biden echoed Obamas theme in a march with an influential labor leader, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who introduced Biden in Pittsburgh as a \"brother\" and \"a champion of working men and working women.\" A few along the parade route chanted \"run, Biden, run,\" in a reference to Bidens ongoing deliberations about whether to run for president in 2016. , In Boston, Obama was flanked by prominent Democrats such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren and a giant banner reading \"Workers and Community\" in red, white and blue. Labor leaders Randi Weingarten and Mary Kay Henry joined Obama for the flight on Air Force One. In the corridors of the hotel hosting the breakfast, boxes of campaign signs could be spotted bearing the name of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who opposes the trade deals. , Obama chose Labor Day to announce the executive order as he works to enact what workplace policies he can before his presidency ends despite resistance in Congress to laws hes proposed. The push has reverberated on the 2016 campaign trail, with Democrats seeking a distinction with Republicans on whos most supportive of the middle class. , The president didnt mention any of the 2016 candidates by name, but invoked a number of their policies to challenge claims that they care about workers. In a reference to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, he remarked incredulously that one GOP candidate had \"said busting unions prepared him to fight ISIL,\" an acronym for the Islamic State group. , Obama chose Massachusetts as the backdrop for his Labor Day message because voters in the state approved a similar paid leave policy state-wide. The law took effect July 1 and is expected to affect 900,000 workers who previously received no paid leave, the White House said. , Roughly 44 million American private sector workers dont get paid sick leave, the administration said. The White House said it couldnt estimate how many federal contractors dont offer paid leave. , ", "Date": "20150910", "Title": "[Courting unions on Labor Day, Obama pushes paid sick leave]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Obama-observes-Labor-Day-extends-contractors-6488929.php", "Author": "[Josh Lederman, Associated Press]"}
{"Content": "[ Caption, Close, President Barack Obama traveled to Puerto Rico in 2011, marking the first visit to the country by a sitting U.S. president since John F. Kennedy. , In his sixth State of the Union address, President Barack Obama rightly touted his decision to do what other administrations have been unwilling or too afraid to do: end the U.S. embargo on Cuba. Now that the U.S. is closing the books on some historical anachronisms in the Caribbean, its time to address another one: Americas political relationship with Puerto Rico. , The three countries histories became intertwined after the Spanish-American War of 1898, when America dismantled the remains of Spains overseas empire, asserted the right to intervene in Cuba whenever it saw fit, and claimed Puerto Rico and the Philippines for itself. Cuba has since remained independent, and the Philippines gained its own independence after World War II. But it may surprise some to learn that 116 years after the \"splendid little war,\" Puerto Rico remains a U.S. colony. , Some may quibble with the term  \"colony,\" but the label fits. Although Puerto Ricans elect a governor and legislature, have their own Supreme Court and even a constitution, the island remains an \"unincorporated territory\" of the U.S. The U.S. controls Puerto Ricos defense, monetary system, commercial shipping, air space, territorial waters, national parks, immigration, international relations - the list goes on and on. Puerto Rico is a self-governing territory, but a territory all the same. , If you support independence for Puerto Rico, the drawbacks of this colonial relationship are clear enough. But those who favor closer ties to the U.S. also find this relationship intolerable. Statehood supporters routinely decry the islands lack of voting representatives in Congress - despite having a larger population than 22 states. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens by birth yet cannot vote for president while living on the island. But they can cast that vote if they move to, say, Florida or Texas, as many do. Under the status quo, Puerto Ricans neither fully govern themselves nor fully participate in American democracy. , Puerto Ricans dont agree on much when it comes to politics - as someone who grew up there, I dare anyone who wants to see real polarization to spend an election season on the island - but they agree about the need to dump the status quo. In a 2012 Election Day referendum, 54 percent of voters rejected the current \"commonwealth\" political status. (Nearly two-thirds favored statehood in a second question, but commonwealth supporters argue that low turnout and the lack of a valid alternative to statehood and independence on the ballot invalidate the results.) , A majority coalition composed of supporters of statehood, independence (a small but influential minority), and a sizable portion of commonwealth supporters now favors decolonization. The question is: What relationship is America willing to have with its 4 million Caribbean citizens in the future? Is it willing to accept Puerto Rico as the 51st state, and if so, whats the price of admission? Under what conditions would it grant independence? What kind of noncolonial, intermediate status would it be willing to negotiate with Puerto Rico? Individual decision makers have expressed preferences, but its time for the U.S. government to speak with one voice. , The toxic U.S.-Cuban relationship has left its mark on Puerto Rico. For much of the Cold War, America portrayed Puerto Rico as a successful, democratic-capitalist alternative to Cubas socialist dictatorship, while Cuba loudly denounced Puerto Ricos persistent colonial status and called for full independence. The island also became a battleground between Cuban and American intelligence forces, with Cubans fomenting opposition and violent acts against the U.S. government while American intelligence and law enforcement persecuted independence supporters with real or imagined ties to Cuba. The battleground has cleared since the collapse of the Soviet Union, but Puerto Ricos fate remains unresolved. , Before Obamas announcement, the Cuban embargo and Puerto Ricos status were twin historical relics. America is finally disposing of one of those relics, but it needs to do away with both for good. , , Hestres is an assistant professor of communication at the University of Texas at San Antonio.

(Johnny Hanson / Houston Chronicle), Opponents of Houstons non-discrimination ordinance failed to gather enough valid signatures to force a repeal referendum, a state district judge ruled Friday, validating city officials decision to toss out the petition foes submitted last summer. , After separate rulings from both a jury and state District Judge Robert Schaffer, attorneys for both sides entered dueling counts of the valid signatures, adding and subtracting voters as Schaffer responded to motions. By early this week, the counts were closer together than ever before, fewer than 1,000 signatures apart. , Ultimately, Schaffer on Friday ruled the final count of valid signatures was 16,684, leaving opponents short of the threshold required in the city charter of 17,249 signatures, or 10 percent of the ballots cast in the last mayoral election. , \"The jurys verdict and the judges ruling are a powerful smack-down against the forces of discrimination and intolerance,\" said Geoffrey Harrison, lead attorney for the city, in a statement. \"And maybe, just maybe, theyll reconsider their misguided ways.\", The law, on hold during trial, is now in effect, according to a city spokeswoman. Mayor Annise Parker released a statement celebrating the verdict. , \"I would hope that the plaintiffs would not appeal, they lost during a jury trial and today they also lost with the judges ruling,\" Parker said. \"Now all Houstonians have access to the same protections.\", But opponents, largely conservative activists and pastors whose objections center on the protections the law extends to gay and transgender residents, say they will appeal the decision. , Andy Taylor, attorney for the plaintiffs, said he remains confident they will ultimately take the law to voters. He was particularly upset with rulings that some illegible signatures were disqualified. , \"We intend to appeal and are confident the higher courts will agree that good handwriting is not a valid reason to deny citizens of their constitutional rights to vote,\" Taylor said. , Mayor Annise Parker and her former city attorney rejected the petition last August, triggering the lawsuit. At issue in the case was not the ordinance itself, but whether opponents petition contained enough valid signatures. City officials said the 5,200-page document was riddled with forgery and errors, while opponents said the city sought and falsely found problems with the petition. , Approved last May by the City Council, the ordinance bans discrimination among businesses that serve the public, private employers, in housing and in city employment and city contracting. Enforcement of the ordinance remains on hold while the law is tied up in the courts. , Schaffers ruling reflects a higher but not wildly different tally than the 15,250-signature count former City Attorney David Feldman announced in rejecting the petition last year. Feldman threw out nearly half the petition pages, saying many of those who circulated the pages made serious errors. The court case, with a week of testimony followed by a week of jury deliberations, went into the weeds on these technical issues, often focusing on the validity of the signatures and even the penmanship of individual petition organizers and signers. , Even this week, attorneys on both sides were still seeking to preclude or add signatures as Schaffer put together his finaly tally. On Friday morning, Taylor filed a last-minute plea for a recount, asking Schaffer to order City Secretary Anna Russell to count the number for registered Houston voters that signed the petition.]", "Date": "20150417", "Title": "[Judge sides with city in equal rights case]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/houston/article/Judge-sides-with-city-in-equal-rights-case-6207417.php", "Author": "[By Katherine Driessen]"}

Couples turned away could seek a court order, and a clerk who still refuses to issue a license could be jailed for contempt, Marcosson said. , They also risk criminal official misconduct charges, said Warren County Attorney Ann Milliken, president of the Kentucky County Attorneys Association. The misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail, is committed when a public servant \"refrains from performing a duty imposed upon him by law or clearly inherent in the nature of his office.\", Casey Davis, the clerk in Casey County, Kentucky, says he wont resign and hed rather go to jail than issue a marriage license to a same-sex couple. None have yet come in to get one, he said. , After the Supreme Court declared that marriage is a constitutional right equally held by all Americans, clerks in Arkansas and Mississippi resigned Tuesday rather than be forced to sign the licenses of gays and lesbians. Linda Barnette, the circuit clerk in Grenada County, Mississippi, for 24 years, wrote in her resignation letter that she is a \"follower of Christ\" and that she chooses \"to obey God rather than man.\", Other reluctant Kentucky clerks gave up the fight on Tuesday. , Lawrence County Clerk Chris Jobe, who also serves as president of the Kentucky County Clerks Association, told The Courier-Journal in Louisville that he would resume issuing licenses for fear of being removed from office. Several other Kentucky clerks made similar concessions. , Even in Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana, where governors took the most vigorous stands against Fridays Supreme Courts ruling, clerks were issuing licenses. , But Davis stayed firm in denying one Tuesday to April Miller and Karen Roberts, a couple of 11 years who live in Morehead. , The office of Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway encouraged any couples who are turned away to seek private counsel. Miller and Roberts contacted the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky to represent them. , \"This is where we live; we pay taxes here, we vote here. And we want to get married here,\" said Miller. , Outside Davis office, drivers honked and waved, flew rainbow flags from their windows and shouted \"love must win!\", But a small group also gathered to support Davis, demonstrating the stark divide that remains in the most theologically conservative stretches of the South and Midwest, where state leaders fought hard for years to prevent same-sex marriage. , \"Our country is on the wrong path, we as a people no longer exalt God,\" said Dennis Buschman, who carried a Bible as he led a half-dozen people supporting the clerks defiance. He called homosexuality an \"abomination\" and a \"serious, serious sin.\", Some protesters confronted them. , \"God did not elect her, I did,\" said Kevin Bass, a former police officer who arrived at the courthouse with his wife to support gay couples seeking licenses. \"If she objects to doing her job, she can go.\", As a police officer for 20 years, he said, he could not choose which laws he liked to enforce. , Inside the county building, Davis seemed worried. She showed the AP a curse-laden hate mail she received overnight. When she took her oath of office in January and promised to uphold the state constitution, gay marriage wasnt a part of the deal, she figures. , Davis would not say whether shell quit her job to stand up for her beliefs, but vowed never to issue a marriage license to a gay couple. , \"No man can put a harness on his conscience.

{"Content": "[ Caption, Close, Protestors hold up signs containing slogans and the names of 11 people detained in a demonstration days earlier, as they march to call for the return of 43 missing students and the liberation of the detained, in Mexico City, Tuesday, Nov. 25, 2014. Nearly two months after the students disappeared following an attack by police, protests only continue to multiply, as citizens demand that the government find the missing students alive. (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell), These are dark days in Mexico. While Americans the past few days have been captivated by events in Ferguson, Mo. , Mexicans in huge numbers have been marching, protesting and demanding answers regarding 43 students who are missing and presumed dead in the state of Guerrero in southwestern Mexico. , Their mass disappearance nine weeks ago may not represent a \"breaking point,\" as some have suggested, for a country that has endured more than its share of brutal drug violence. But it could be a breaking point for the government of President Enrique Pea Nieto, and that could have major implications for the United States. , Since his election in 2012 with 38 percent of the vote, the president has tried to shift the focus from pervasive drug violence to ambitious economic reform, and hes had some success. Until now. His governments sluggish response to the students disappearance, along with a scandal involving a $7 million mansion for his wife, has refocused the harsh spotlight on the countrys endemic corruption and security problems. , As Brookings Institution fellow Diana Villiers Negroponte has pointed out, the distinction between the six years of violence against drug cartels under President Felipe Caldern and the current wave of violence - the 43 students and others - is that Mexicos armed forces and its municipal and state police are implicated. The Mexican people, she notes, dont know who to fear the most: the cartels or state officials. , The students in Guerrero were traveling to the rural town of Iguala on Sept. 26 to protest education reforms when they were stopped by police and gunmen thought to belong to a local cartel. Authorities believe the police turned the students over to the cartel, Guerreros Unidos. , The mayor of the town and his wife have been arrested and charged with ordering the police to capture the students out of fear they would disrupt a speech the wife was going to make. Three of the gang members have confessed to murdering the students, burning them and throwing the remains in plastic bags in a nearby river and garbage dump. , This horrific incident could not have come at a worse time for the Pea Nieto government. The president and his supporters have been anxious to assure foreign investors that a new PRI government has transformed Mexico into a safe, reliable and increasingly prosperous business partner. But the incidents of lawlessness and corruption suggest that little if anything has changed. , An increasingly skeptical nation seems fed up with blanket government assurances, and investors, in this country and elsewhere, must surely be apprehensive about the long-term success of the structural and institutional reforms the president has been advocating.  , Revelations of shady dealings surrounding the mansion Pea Nietos wife was building, while not as significant as the students disappearance, also have tarnished the presidents well-crafted image. The house scandal may have led to the cancellation of a $4 billion bullet-train project awarded to a Chinese-led consortium that included a Pea Nieto crony and other firms with ties to Pea Nietos political party. Mexican officials and business executives insist that the cancellation proves that Mexican bidding processes are clean and fair, but its not hard to imagine international investors - Houston energy companies, for example - reconsidering their involvement in Mexico. , Pea Nieto must somehow convince the Mexican people that he will do whatever is within his power to assure a complete and transparent investigation into the disappearance of the students. He also needs to pay as much attention to reforming criminal justice procedures as he has to his bold economic reforms. The endemic corruption in many of Mexicos 2,400 municipalities means that extortion, kidnappings and retail drug trade continue to flourish unimpeded. , Pea Nieto seems to understand that his nation stands at a crossroads. Either Mexico can continue its efforts to become a stronger democracy with a burgeoning middle class and a commitment to the rule of law, or it can allow its immense challenges - violence, illegality, corruption - to overwhelm the advances it has made in recent years. , Mexicos success matters a great deal to its northern neighbor. Its Mexicos task, of course, but given our ties of commerce, culture and community, the U.S. has opportunities to help. , Whether its countering the drug trade in this country, working cooperatively with Mexico on immigration or working together to upgrade border infrastructure, we have can assist our neighbor on its long march toward a secure, peaceful and prosperous future and help ourselves in the process.]", "Date": "20141129", "Title": "[Editorial: Mexico's dark days]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/editorials/article/Mexico-s-dark-days-5923444.php", "Author": "[Copyright 2014: Houston Chronicle]"}

Walker gave a quick \"yes,\" but he declined to address whether he supports deporting children of parents in the country illegally. \"Going forward, the best thing we can do is enforce the law,\" he said. , Walker, who reversed his position in April on allowing a chance for legal status for those in the country illegally, also gave mixed answers on ending birthright citizenship. , Christie said during a CNN interview that a wall or fence along parts of the border, especially in more urban and difficult-to-control areas, was conceivable, but \"not the entire border. Doesnt make any sense.\" Likewise, the New Jersey governor is opposed to requiring Mexico to pay for the construction, saying Trumps suggestion \"makes no sense.\", \"And this is not negotiation of a real estate deal, OK. This is international diplomacy and its different,\" Christie said, noting Trumps line of business. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina called Trumps wall plan, \"completely unrealistic.\", Trump wasnt flinching Monday. , \"The wall will work,\" he said when he arrived for jury duty in New York and a passer-by at the courthouse asked about the idea. He spent much of the day like other prospective jurors, filling out forms and waiting to see if he would be picked. In the end, he wasnt. , Like Trumps early derogatory campaign statements about immigrants, his new plan has lit up angry conservatives. But it also has annoyed Republicans who see the nations growing Latino population as an opportunity to demonstrate sensitivity to minorities who have voted overwhelmingly Democratic in recent presidential elections. , Tea party movement co-founder Mark Meckler said Trumps \"position on deportation generally reflects what likely voters think. Trump is dealing head-on with the difficult issues while more establishment candidates fret over focus groups and polls.\", Trump also is calling for eliminating federal aid to \"sanctuary cities,\" such as San Francisco, where local officials have decided not to use their police to enforce some federal immigration laws. The position is also supported by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. , Like Christie, however, Bush differs sharply with Trump on other aspects of immigration policy. Though he didnt chime in specifically on Trumps new proposal, Bush supports allowing people in the country illegally who have not committed major crimes, who work and follow a course such as learning English and paying fines, to stay in the United States. , In a late July Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, 64 percent of Americans said they support either a path to permanent legal status or citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally. According to the poll, a small majority of Republicans fall into the same category. , South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, also speaking at the fair, called Trumps proposal \"gibberish,\" but warned it also sends a hostile signal toward Latinos voters. , \"Youre not going to get 11 million people and drive them back out of this country,\" he said. \"Thats just not practical. Thats going to kill the Republican Party.\", Though Ohio Gov. John Kasich supports building a wall, he, like Bush supports maintaining birthright citizenship and allowing a pathway to legal status for immigrants. , \"They are a very important part of most of our communities,\" Kasich said in South Carolina. \"For the bulk of them, they are God-fearing, good, hardworking people, and they are a part of our country now.\", Fiorina said to change birthright citizenship would be rigorous. \"It would take passing a constitutional amendment to get that changed. This is part of our 14th Amendment, and so honestly I think we should put all of our energies, all of our political will over finally getting the border secured and fixing the legal immigration system.\", ", "Date": "20150821", "Title": "[Trump immigration proposal divides GOP presidential field]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Trump-immigration-proposal-divides-GOP-6449378.php", "Author": "[Thomas Beaumont, Associated Press]"}

Outlined in a so-called \"autopsy\" of 2012 nominee Mitt Romneys loss to President Barack Obama, it called for passing \"comprehensive immigration reform\"  shorthand for resolving the status of the estimated 11 million people living in the country illegally. , Those plans ran aground in the GOP-controlled House, falling victim to the passionate opposition among conservatives to anything they deem \"amnesty\" for such immigrants. , Some Republicans then hoped candidates with more moderate positions on immigration  such as Jeb Bush, the Spanish-speaking former Florida governor, or Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native and son of Cuban parents  would rise during the 2016 campaign and boost the partys appeal to Hispanic voters. , Instead, its Trump  with his call to deport everyone living in the U.S. illegally and eliminate birthright citizenship  who has surged to the top of the summertime polls, reinforcing the lasting power of white, conservative voters who the GOP has courted for decades and continue to dominate the partys presidential primaries. , \"Donald Trump is telling the truth and people dont always like that,\" Donald Kidd, a 73-year-old retired pipe welder from Mobile, Alabama, said at a weekend rally for Trump. , Kidd added that Trump was \"like George Wallace,\" the former Alabama governor and presidential candidate known for his outspoken conservative rhetoric and segregationist views. , Trumps growing support appears to have pushed some of his rivals to match his hard-line positions on immigration. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker quickly echoed Trumps call for ending birthright citizenship. While Walker later backed off, Cruz has refused to join with those who criticized Trump after he called immigrants from Mexico rapists and criminals. , On Thursday, Cruz and Trump announced plans to appear together at a rally next month in Washington. , \"Other campaigns should look at incorporating what hes saying,\" said South Carolina Rep. Jeff Duncan, who represents the most Republican congressional district in the early-voting state. He said he doesnt know how Trumps proposals are playing with Hispanics, but said his message \"resonates with average Americans.\", Trump mixes his boasts on immigration, including his pledge to build a \"beautiful\" wall on the nations Southern border to stop illegal crossings, with talk about how hell focus on jobs if elected president, which would be a boon for minorities who endure higher rates of unemployment. But Ferrel Guillory, a longtime political observer at the University of North Carolina, said it is rhetoric that nonetheless \"signals to white voters, especially through the immigration issue.\", The billionaire businessman has frequently referred to his supporters as the \"silent majority,\" a phrase used by Richard Nixon as part of his \"Southern strategy\" to bolster support from working class white voters in the 1968 and 1972 elections. At a news conference in South Carolina on Thursday, Trump brushed aside questions about the terms loaded history. , \"Im just bringing it to modern day,\" he said, arguing that his backers are \"a silent majority in this country that feels abused, that feels forgotten, that feels mistreated ... that wants the country to have victories again.\", For decades, Republicans sank their presidential hopes into winning over white working- and middle-class voters. But as the country grows increasingly diverse, winning the majority of white voters  which may yield victories in the GOP primaries  is no longer enough to power a candidate to success in the general election. , That was the stark lesson for Republicans in 2012. GOP nominee Mitt Romney won 59 percent of the white vote in the general election, but garnered just 27 percent from Hispanics, 26 percent from Asians and 6 percent from black voters. , It was the worst performance from a Republican candidate among Hispanic voters in a decade, and Obama swept every competitive state in the nation save North Carolina. , Thats undoubtedly why Hillary Rodham Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, has argued that theres little difference between Trump and the other GOP candidates on immigration. And why Bush, who is married to a Mexican woman and famously said Republican candidates for president must be willing to risk losing in the primaries if they hope to win in the general election, has been among his sharpest critics. , \"Hes appealing to peoples angst and their anger,\" Bush said this week. \"I want to solve problems so we can fix this and turn immigration into what its always been  an economic driver for our country.\", ", "Date": "20150830", "Title": "[Trump proposals risk deepening GOP rift on immigration]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/texas/article/Trump-proposals-risk-deepening-GOP-rift-on-6470703.php", "Author": "[Julie Pace and Bill Barrow, Associated Press]"}

Rick Perry speaks at the Eagle Council XLIV, sponsored by the Eagle Forum in St. Louis Friday, Sept. 11, 2015. During the speech Perry said he is ending his second bid for the Republican presidential nomination, becoming the first major candidate of the 2016 campaign to give up on the White House. , ST. LOUIS (AP)  A growing divide has emerged in the Republican Partys unruly presidential contest, as the race bid farewell to a once-powerful White House contender. On one side stands billionaire businessman Donald Trump and his allies, on the other are those who oppose him. , A day after Rick Perry, Texas longest-serving governor, ended his second Republican presidential run with a whimper, Trump marked the shake-up by embracing his role as his partys 2016 bully on Saturday. , \"Mr. Perry, hes gone. Good luck. He was very nasty to me,\" Trump told Iowa voters. Turning to rival Ben Carson, he questioned whether the retired neurosurgeon had \"the energy\" to negotiate successfully with world leaders. In an interview earlier, Trump touted his tough-talking style as a plus. , \"Its an attitude that our country needs. We get pushed around by everybody,\" he told Fox News, adding, \"We have to push back.\", Perry had all but declared war on the billionaire businessman in July, calling Trump \"a cancer on conservatism\" who could destroy the Republican Party. On Saturday, Trumps campaign was soaring while Perrys White House ambitions were dead. And with the real estate mogul suffocating the rest of the packed field, its likely a matter of time before he helps push another GOP candidate out of the race. , Perry was a leading voice in the anti-Trump movement, a group that has suffered in the polls as Trumps public allies largely avoid backlash from the anti-insider wave that made Trump the unlikeliest of Republican presidential front-runners. , \"There is no play in the playbook for where we are right now,\" said John Jordan, a California winery owner and major Republican fundraiser. \"Donors dont know what to think. Nobody saw the Trump phenomenon coming.\", In still-early polls, the real-estate mogul and reality TV star has more support that the once-top-tier trio of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio combined. In second, by the way, is another political rookie: Carson, who repeatedly refused to criticize Trump in recent days. , Bush has gone the other way in recent weeks, jabbing the businessman repeatedly on the campaign trail and through social media. He was at it again Saturday while meeting with supporters in Miami. , \"Mr. Trump says that I cant speak Spanish,\" Bush told the crowd in Spanish. \"Pobrecito (poor guy).\", Walker, another Trump critic, has also struggled recently, particularly in Iowa, where he was considered a front-runner for much of the year. The Wisconsin governor canceled upcoming appearances in California and Michigan to focus instead on the critical early voting Iowa and South Carolina. , \"Nothing changed for us aside from some scheduling,\" Walker spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said, dismissing any suggestion the campaign was concerned. , On the other end of the spectrum, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, perhaps Trumps biggest ally, declined to address the Trump effect on Perrys exit on Saturday. , \"I recognize that the media enjoys seeing Republicans bicker back and forth with each other and throw rocks at each other. But I think the American people could not care less,\" Cruz told reporters after addressing the same gathering of social conservatives in St. Louis that Perry shocked the night before with his announcement. , A tea party favorite, Cruz has declined to seize on Trumps positions that would normally trigger conservative ire. , Trump favors tax increases on the rich, once supported abortion rights, gave money to Hillary Rodham Clinton and said kind things about government-run health care in other countries. , \"Someone has to bring him down. ... Im not going to sit quietly by and let the disaster that is Donald Trump become the nominee,\" Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul told The Associated Press. \"Do you want someone who appears to still be in grade school to be in charge of the nuclear arsenal?\", Meanwhile, Perrys allies at three well-funded super PACs found they couldnt share the money theyve raised or coordinate their activities with his campaign. Austin Barbour, a leader of the pro-Perry super PACs, said the groups have as much as $13 million in the bank. He planned to talk with lawyers to \"see what the law says we can do with this money.\", Perrys Republican rivals praised him publicly and privately  and began courting his political network. Cruz on Saturday said Perry did \"a remarkable job as governor\" and praised him for running \"an honorable campaign.\", A person close to the Cruz campaign, who was not authorized to speak publicly and requested anonymity, says the fellow Texans camp will be \"immediately\" reaching out to Perry donors and supporters. \"If we dont jump in, other campaigns are going to try to,\" the person said. , ", "Date": "20150915", "Title": "[Trump embraces role as bully, bids Perry a thorny farewell]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/texas/article/Perry-first-to-exit-2016-race-as-Trump-suffocates-6500108.php", "Author": "[Steve Peoples, Associated Press]"}

Bush and the Republican field in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. In 2013, an immigration overhaul seeking to address illegal immigration passed the Senate with strong Republican support, although the House never took it up. And Republican debate about immigration has only intensified in the wake of President Barack Obamas sweeping executive action shielding from deportation millions of immigrants in the U.S. illegally. , ", "Date": "20150807", "Title": "[FACT CHECK: GOP candidates veer from the truth in 1st debate]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/texas/article/FACT-CHECK-GOP-candidates-veer-from-the-truth-in-6430529.php", "Author": "[Josh Lederman, Associated Press]"}
{"Content": "[ Caption, Close, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump takes a photo with a supporter after speaking at a campaign event in Dallas, Monday, Sept. 14, 2015. , WASHINGTON (AP)  Republican presidential candidates not named Donald Trump have raised hundreds of millions of dollars for their campaigns and allied groups. Yet none of that money is being targeted against the celebrity real estate mogul, the partys front-runner through the summer. , Now the first well-funded anti-Trump volley is coming, though not from another candidate. Its from the Club for Growth, a Washington-based tax-cutting advocacy group that just months ago asked Trump for a contribution. , The group said Tuesday it will spend $1 million assailing Trump on TV in the early caucus state of Iowa. Its 30-second commercials, which begin Thursday, call him \"the worst kind of politician,\" highlight some of his most liberal positions and say hes playing voters \"for chumps.\", Trump would seem a ripe target for any conservative organization: Hes said in the past that he identifies \"more as a Democrat.\", For now, though, Club for Growth is going it alone. , Some of the largest pro-Republican political groups  including the Koch brothers-led Americans for Prosperity, GOP strategist Karl Roves Crossroads groups and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce  say they have no immediate plans to swat at him. , Fred Malek, a longtime Republican presidential fundraiser who isnt aligned with a specific candidate, said the approach of many has been to \"let Trump beat Trump.\", \"Im not aware of any organized effort to attack Trump,\" Malek said. \"Rather, the best-informed Republicans feel the American people are smart enough to figure this out and wont nominate Trump.\", Similarly, the candidates themselves, and the super PACs trying to help them win, havent put any money into a Trump-defeating effort on television. Instead, their strategy appears to be to wait for the star of the political summer to fade on his own. , Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who last week became the first candidate to leave the 2016 race, was one of the feistiest Trump combatants, but his super PACs never paid for any ads to amplify that message. , \"Our plan, which I think is where a lot of folks are, was to wait as long as possible to do contrast ads or attacks on Trump,\" said Austin Barbour, leader of a trio of super PACs that supported Perry. \"Theres a feeling that his poll numbers are vastly inflated and will start coming down on their own, so no one wants to spend valuable resources doing what may just happen naturally.\", Club for Growth, which is paying for the ads through its super PAC, is no longer willing to wait. , The clubs resident, David McIntosh, said he at first assumed that Trump wasnt a credible candidate but the candidates continued rise in the polls showed otherwise. , \"Weve realized weve got to take Donald Trump seriously and really show what his record is,\" McIntosh said. , Club for Growth may not seem the perfect Trump-slayer; it unsuccessfully solicited a $1 million contribution from him in June. Indeed, Trump wrote Tuesday on Twitter that the club is \"little respected\" and, having been spurned by him, is \"spending lobbyist and special interest money on ads\" against him. , With the second GOP debate this week and voting in the earliest primary states less than five months away, the candidates and groups helping them are beginning to spend money on TV ads. Through the end of June, donors backing Trumps Republican opponents had given about $300 million, Federal Election Commission reports show. , So far that money is helping the candidates define themselves rather than tear down Trump. , Right to Rise, a super PAC created to help former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, is on the air beginning $24 million worth of ads casting the former Florida governor as a \"proven conservative\" with \"real results.\" The ads are in Iowa and New Hampshire and spread South Carolina next week. , Trumps meteoric rise has come not after a slew of pricey, well-crafted advertisements, but with the benefit of intense media coverage, which costs him nothing. , The Trump phenomenon \"in a weird way is showing the diminishing importance of money in politics,\" said John Jordan, a California winery owner and major Republican donor. \"And because of that, I think the flow of money is slowing to a trickle.\", Through the end of June, Trump had mostly paid his own way, lending his campaign nearly all of the $1.9 million it reported raising. , The billionaire candidate has pledged to spend whatever it takes to win the GOP nomination, meaning that even the best-funded opponents or Republican groups could find themselves financially overmatched. , ", "Date": "20150915", "Title": "[Club for Growth to spend $1M on TV ads going after Trump]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Club-for-Growth-to-spend-1M-on-TV-ads-going-6505541.php", "Author": "[Julie Bykowicz, Associated Press]"}

He said Russian President Vladimir Putin should know that his \"adventurism\" comes with \"a price to pay.\", \"Rather than reacting to the bad behavior, I think we need to be more forward-leaning as it relates to what the consequences will be,\" Bush said. , The remarks were part of Bushs ongoing efforts to pitch an aggressive foreign policy as he struggles to break out of a crowded Republican presidential primary in which businessman and former television reality star Donald Trump has garnered much of the attention. , Pushing a hawkish foreign policy is a staple of Republican presidential politics. The exception is Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, and even the libertarian-leaning senator has refused to take military action off the table as he argues for a reduced American footprint around the world. , Yet for Bush, the discussion comes with particular challenges as he tries to distance himself from former President George W.

We ought to fix the problem rather than take away rights that are constitutionally endowed.\", Bush also opposed Trumps idea of a fence or wall along the border. , \"Its not realistic to create a fence in places where fences cant be built.

Rand Paul has his hands in both, as he runs for president and re-election to the Senate. , The candidate for two offices at once handles questions about the endeavors by saying hes running for re-election by doing a good job in the Senate. He suggests that whichever office he might win next year, hes working for the same policy goals. , \"I continue to be someone who votes against spending, particularly spending money we dont have,\" Paul said. , Pauls seat in Republican-leaning Kentucky is key to holding the new GOP majority next year. But so far Pauls campaign to keep that seat barely exists, overshadowed by his presidential bid. , Since announcing his presidential candidacy in April, Paul has spent at least 26 days campaigning in early primary and caucus states while skipping the Fancy Farm Picnic and the Kentucky Ham Breakfast - essential cattle calls for statewide office seekers in Kentucky. In the last six weeks, he has held public events in Kentucky for four days. , He has transferred $1.4 million from his Senate campaign to his presidential effort, leaving him with $1.5 million in cash for the Senate race. Fellow Kentucky U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, now the Senate majority leader, had nearly $10 million in cash available at the same time during his last re-election bid. , \"I think right now voters are giving him a bit of a pass as he pursues the presidency,\" said Republican state Sen. Damon Thayer, one of Pauls allies. \"I do think there is a limit on it. But I dont know what that limit is.\", It probably helps Paul that he is facing scant pressure back home from Democrats, so far. Popular Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear and Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer have both said they will not run for Senate. , Paul says he doesnt think the presidential campaign had weakened his re-election chances in Kentucky. , \"If you look at most of the polls I think most people in Kentucky approve of what Im trying to do,\" he said. , The Republican Party of Kentucky does. Last week, the partys central committee voted to create a presidential caucus in Kentucky. It allows people to be on the ballot for president on March 5 and be on the ballot again for Senate on May 17 without violating a state law that bans candidates from appearing on the ballot twice in the same election. , Debbie Helton closed her Somewhere in Time antiques shop last week so she could come hear Paul speak in Corbin. For about an hour, Paul discussed concerns about drug addiction, government benefits and President Barack Obamas new emission standards for coal-fired power plants as rules imposed without approval from Congress. , Helton said she doesnt see how Paul can \"concentrate on two areas at one time.\", \"I cant do it myself,\" she said.]", "Date": "20150828", "Title": "[In Kentucky, the other 2016 race plays out for Rand Paul]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/article/In-Kentucky-the-other-2016-race-plays-out-for-6471692.php", "Author": "[Adam Beam, Associated Press]"}

Ted Cruz accused Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of lying, and said he was no better than his Democratic predecessor and couldnt be trusted. , Cruz, a Texan who is running for president but ranks low in early polling, delivered the broadside in a speech on the Senate floor Friday, an extraordinary departure from the norms of Senate behavior that demand courtesy and respect. , \"Not only what he told every Republican senator, but what he told the press over and over and over again, was a simple lie,\" Cruz said. , At issue were assurances Cruz claimed McConnell, R-Ky. , had given that there was no deal to allow a vote to renew the federal Export-Import Bank  a little-known federal agency that has become a rallying cry for conservatives. Cruz rose to deliver his remarks moments after McConnell had lined up a vote on the Export-Import Bank for coming days. , \"It saddens me to say this. I sat in my office, I told my staff the majority leader looked me in the eye and looked 54 Republicans in the eye. I cannot believe he would tell a flat-out lie,\" Cruz said. , \"We now know that when the majority leader looks us in the eyes and makes an explicit commitment that he is willing to say things that he knows are false.\", The majority leader was not on the Senate floor when Cruz issued his attack, and ignored reporters who tried to ask him about it in the Capitols hallways. A spokesman said McConnell would have no response. , McConnell has long indicated he would allow a vote on the Export-Import Bank as an amendment on the highway bill, which is the course hes now following. Senate supporters of the Export-Import Bank have said they got that commitment from McConnell in the course of debate on a separate trade bill, though theres been some dispute about what precisely was agreed to. , No senator rose to defend McConnell on the floor, as some Republicans sought to avoid engaging in the dispute and giving Cruz still more attention. Questioned by reporters later, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, challenged Cruzs criticism of McConnell, telling reporters, \"I think its wrong to disclose private information, especially when the disclosure is not accurate.\", \"Keep in mind, hes running for president,\" Hatch added. \"People who run for president do some very interesting things.\", McConnell and Cruz have never had a thriving relationship. The new majority leaders allies earlier this year derided Cruzs Senate record, complaining that he often speaks out but has missed important developments. After complaining about President Barack Obamas nomination of Loretta Lynch as attorney general, for example, Cruz skipped the final vote on her confirmation. , Some close to McConnell call Cruz \"Mr. 1 percent,\" referring to his share of support in the crowded race for the GOP presidential nomination. Recent polls have him a few points higher among more than a dozen contenders. , Cruz, for his part, has grown increasingly outspoken about his contempt for McConnell and other Republicans, using his newly published book, \"A Time for Truth,\" to attack his colleagues on various fronts and accuse them of failing to stand up for their principles. , On Friday he charged that the Senate under Republican control is no different from when Democrats ran the show before this year and McConnell is behaving like his Democratic predecessor, Harry Reid of Nevada. Republicans accused Reid of shutting down debate and limiting amendments when he ran the Senate. , \"Now the Republican leader is behaving like the senior senator from Nevada,\" Cruz complained. He also derided an announcement from McConnell that the Senate will vote Sunday to repeal Obamas health care law, calling it \"an empty show vote\" and \"exercise in meaningless political theater\" because the legislation will inevitably fail to get the 60 votes needed to advance. , \"We keep winning elections and then we keep getting leaders who dont do anything they promised,\" Cruz said. , The Senates historian, Betty K. Koed, said that it was not a specific breach of Senate rules to call another senator a liar, but pointed to rules cautioning against talking ill of other members or imputing unbecoming conduct or motives. , \"In more recent times theres been very little of this type of behavior,\" Koed said. , ", "Date": "20150727", "Title": "[In stunning attack, Cruz accuses leader McConnell of lying]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/texas/article/Cruz-McConnell-lied-on-Ex-IM-bank-cannot-be-6403318.php", "Author": "[Erica Werner and Laurie Kellman, Associated Press]"}

Scott Walker speaks during a campaign event at a Harley-Davidson dealership Tuesday, July 14, 2015, in Las Vegas. , COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP)  From her public statements of grief to removing the Confederate battle flag from outside her Statehouse office, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has drawn wide praise since the massacre of nine black churchgoers from a historic Charleston congregation. , Now the 43-year-old looks to her next role as the self-described host of a key early presidential primary, with the national attention feeding chatter about her potential as a running mate and as a voice for a Republican Party that needs more votes from women and minorities. , Just how prominent she remains in 2016, though, depends on factors well beyond this latest chapter in Haleys intense, complicated rise from state representative to her tenure as South Carolinas first female and minority governor, a five-year stretch that has rankled many of her fellow Republicans. , \"There are sometimes events in an elected officials life that transcend politics, and this certainly was one for Gov. Haley,\" said Ted Newton, who helped lead the research team that vetted vice presidential prospects for Mitt Romney in 2012. , Newton praised Haleys \"skill and grace\" in recent weeks. Yet, he said, \"The fact that shes in the headlines briefly doesnt guarantee anything. If she stays on a short-list (for vice president), it will be because she survives more intense scrutiny.\", Besides, he said, more often than not, the deciding factor for a nominee picking a running mate is quite simple: personal and political compatibility. , Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker was campaigning Wednesday in South Carolina for the first time since formally launching his bid, the first out-of-state Republican candidate to visit since the Confederate flag came down Friday. , According to her aides, Haley has met in recent months with Walker, Rick Perry, Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Bobby Jindal, Marco Rubio, Rick Santorum, and her hometown senior Sen. Lindsey Graham, fully 10 of the GOPs 15 prominent declared candidates. , Haley refuses to discuss the massacre at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in the context of her future, and she maintains that her change of heart on the battle flag  she had steadfastly sidestepped questions about the banner despite longstanding calls for its removal  was not a political calculation. , \"If people are talking about that, then Im not working hard enough to talk about the (Emanuel) families,\" Haley said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \"I dont want to think about it or talk about it or even acknowledge it at this point.\", South Carolinas place as the first Southern presidential primary next February, weeks after Iowa and New Hampshire open the nominating process, offers a different reality. , \"Everybody was going to covet Nikkis endorsement already,\" said Katon Dawson, a former state Republican Party chairman who backs the White House candidacy of Perry, the former Texas governor. \"Now business is really going to pick up for her.\", Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants, first garnered national attention in 2010, when she won a bruising Republican primary and a competitive general election. , She has sought to define her administration on job creation, primarily through the decisions by BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Boeing and a host of tire makers to establish or expand plants in South Carolina. But shes also had to fend off ethics complaints and routinely battles with her fellow Republicans in the Legislature on tax and budget issues. , In the weeks leading up to 2012 presidential primary, Haley endorsed Romney, who went on to lose South Carolina. The move angered tea party conservatives critical to Haleys 2010 election, but established her as a team player for the national party. , State Rep. Rick Quinn, who has aligned with Haley in her fiscal fights, said the governor faces \"jealousy\" in the Republican-controlled state. But he said presidential candidates should take note of the governing skill she demonstrated in cajoling lawmakers to remove the battle flag. , \"To get 170 politicians to come along with her was a tough task,\" Quinn said, adding, \"She did a lot more than just go have press conferences. She brought us in. ... She showed that shes more than just a talking head or a mouthpiece.\", The decision also helps presidential candidates who now wont have to answer uncomfortable questions about the banner, as candidates have faced in previous election years. , Recalling a conversation she had with Walker about the flag after the church attack, Haley said she told him, \"If you have any uncomfortable things, well help you get through it, but Im going to take care of this.\", ", "Date": "20150718", "Title": "[Charleston massacre, flag debate put Haley in 2016 spotlight]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Charleston-massacre-flag-debate-put-Haley-in-6385496.php", "Author": "[Bill Barrow and Meg Kinnard, Associated Press]"}

Bush won widespread praise, even among critics, for his deft handling of the storms. , During the hurricanes, Bush was ubiquitous around the state, warning Floridians about the approaching storms and offering consolation to those who lost their homes or were displaced from them. , The e-book, \"Reply All,\" is to be released Oct. 30, but Bushs campaign made available a 43-page chapter entitled \"We Will Prevail\" to The Associated Press and other media outlets on Tuesday. The chapter deals with hurricanes Charlie, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, which caused $42 billion in damages. , Bush writes about the hurricanes by including email exchanges he had with everyday Floridians, the media and his staff. Each chapter will delve into each of the eight years Bush spent in office as governor. He served two terms, from 1999-2007. , Amazon is taking pre-sale orders on the e-book starting Wednesday. , On Wednesday, Bush visits Pensacola, where he will talk about his experience during the 2004 storms at a town hall meeting. , The four hurricanes were devastating to Florida, leaving $42 billion in damages at a time when the state budget was only $57 billion. The storms damaged or destroyed 700,000 homes and forced Bush to declare a state of emergency in all 67 counties. , In the e-book chapter about the storms, Bush mainly writes about his administrations response and includes a collection of mostly positive e-mails from people praising his leadership during the crisis. , \"Thanks for being a strong leader in a time of need,\" wrote one woman who noted she was \"a loyal Democrat, but supporter of Jeb Bush.\", Another man wrote about his three-year-old daughter asking him question after question about the storms. He said the little girl then saw Bush on television and asked, \"Is that the Storm Governor, Daddy?\", \"This year, 2004, would test our mettle in Florida  you might even say our souls,\" Bush wrote at the start of the chapter. \"We were gloriously unaware of what was to come.\", He later wrote that he and fellow Floridians \"felt a little like the survivors of a shipwreck\" because the \"worst had happened, and we were still there.\", Quoting a speech he made to mark the end of hurricane season in November 2004, Bush wrote that he had \"never been prouder to be governor of Florida.\", As governor, Bush carried a Blackberry at all times, spending 25 to 30 hours a week emailing and responding to staff and Florida residents.

Jeb Bush, left, is interviewed by Dr. Russell Moore at the Send North America Conference, Tuesday, Aug. 4, 2015, in Nashville, Tenn. , NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP)  Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush vowed Tuesday to cut off federal funding for Planned Parenthood if elected to the White House, but drew immediate fire from Democrats for adding, \"Im not sure we need half a billion dollars for womens health issues.\", Democratic frontrunner Hillary Rodham Clinton replied on Twitter, \"@JebBush: You are absolutely, unequivocally wrong.\", And Planned Parenthood issued a statement saying Bush \"told the rest of America what Florida women have known for years, which is that he doesnt believe womens health is worth much.\", Bush leapt at the chance Tuesday to prove his anti-abortion bona fides before a group of largely conservative Christian voters at a meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention. The former Florida governor was asked during an onstage interview, \"Shouldnt we ... say not one more red cent for Planned Parenthood?\", His response  \"The next president should veto Planned Parenthood\"  drew a loud ovation at the packed Bridgestone Arena. , But his comments about money for womens health left Bush and his campaign cleaning up his remarks just hours later. He issued a statement saying he \"misspoke\" when speaking about womens health funding and was referring only to the \"hard-to-fathom $500 million in federal funding\" for Planned Parenthood. , \"There are countless community health centers, rural clinics and other womens health organizations that need to be fully funded,\" Bush said. \"They provide critical services to all, but particularly low-income women who dont have the access they need.\", An earlier statement sent to reporters lacked Bushs assertion that he had misspoken. The campaign said the first version was a draft. , But the latter statement, too, wasnt quite right. Planned Parenthood says of its $1.3 billion in revenue last year, $528 million came from taxpayers, but not all of it was federal money  some came from state funds that help finance Medicaid. , Bushs campaign also included a statement from Rhonda Medows, the secretary of Floridas Health Care Administration agency during his tenure as governor. , \"I watched his dedication to womens health issues and services first hand,\" Medows said. \"He was intent on improving the quality of care offered to women under our state health programs, and he enhanced access to vital services to women through new access points.\", And Bush shot back at Clinton on Twitter, too, writing, \"whats absolutely, unequivocally wrong is giving taxpayer $ to an org whose practices show no regard for lives of unborn.\", At an organizing event later in Denver, Clinton added, \"Now hes got no problem giving away billions of dollars to super-powerful and wealthy corporations, but I guess womens health just isnt a priority for him.\", Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, whos challenging Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, slammed Bush in a fundraising email Tuesday and said, \"We need to be spending a lot more money on womens health care.\", The question of Planned Parenthoods funding leapt into the 2016 presidential contest this week amid an ongoing row into the release of graphic videos, secretly recorded by anti-abortion activists, that show officials of the group describing how they sometimes provide fetal tissue to medical researchers. , Planned Parenthood provides health services, family planning and abortions in clinics nationwide and is a longtime target of conservatives. While federal money is barred from paying for abortions, except for cases of rape, incest or when a womans life is in peril, Republicans would like to cut off tax dollars for the group entirely. , The Senate on Monday voted 53-46 to advance a GOP-backed bill terminating Planned Parenthoods federal funding, seven short of the 60 votes needed to keep the measure moving toward passage. , Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who spoke in a pre-recorded interview to the conference, said the \"erroneous\" 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade that legalized abortion must be overturned. \"Until that decision is reversed there will be abortion in America,\" he said. , Abortion opponents say the recordings caught Planned Parenthood illegally selling the organs for profit, while Planned Parenthood officials  while apologizing for their workers businesslike words  say theyve abided by laws that let them recoup the procedures costs. , \"What those videos revealed more than anything else is that abortion in America has become a money-making industry,\" Rubio said. , ", "Date": "20150809", "Title": "[Dems hit Bush after comments on funding for women's health]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Bush-Rubio-to-speak-before-Southern-Baptist-6423098.php", "Author": "[Sergio Bustos and Erik Schelzig, Associated Press]"}

He personalizes everything. If youre not totally in agreement with him, youre an idiot, youre stupid, you have low energy, blah, blah, blah. Thats what he does.\", The Bush campaign reports that Tuesdays political assault was not an isolated incident, but part of a broader strategy to engage Trump more directly. While the two have traded jabs before, the approach marks a shift for Bush, who previously preferred to ignore Trumps bombast altogether. , \"Trump has attacked Jebs wife, his mother, hes taken him out of context and lied about his record,\" said Bush spokesman Tim Miller. \"Its incumbent upon us to not just set the record straight about Jebs record, and not just fight back, but also expose Trump as somebody whos completely misrepresenting himself to voters.\", Miller promised the campaign would release \"more digital products,\" such as the video, in the coming days, while Bush would continue to be aggressive on the campaign trail. , Bush, the son of one president and brother of another, is certainly not the first Republican presidential contender to go after Trump, yet he has the highest profile of the critics. The struggles of Trumps other critics offer a pointed reminder of the risks of confronting a man whose business is confrontation. , \"Fighting with Donald Trump is like wrestling in the WWE,\" said Republican pollster Frank Luntz, himself the target of insults from Trump. \"It doesnt get you anywhere, and you know its going to hurt.\", Trump released a Web video of his own later in the day highlighting Bushs praise for the Clinton family. And on Twitter, Trump noted that other presidential contenders have tried to take him on. , He dismissed Bushs video as \"yet another weak hit by a candidate with a failing campaign. Will Jeb sink as low in the polls as the others who have gone after me?\", Indeed, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul have lashed out at Trump at times over the summer. Each man dropped in the polls as Trump grew stronger. , Bush maintains an overwhelming fundraising advantage over much of his Republican competition but he, too, has struggled in recent polls. Quinnipiac University pollster Peter Brown noted that no candidate has suffered more during Trumps rise than Bush. , \"Obviously, Trump has found  at least for now  a strategy that works,\" Brown said, adding that Bush may be trying to pitch himself \"as less of a policy wonk and more of a potential president who can dish it out as well as he can take it.\", Political operatives note that the next phase of the 2016 campaign is just beginning. , After a summer season in which most voters typically dont closely follow national politics, many candidates, Bush among them, will start advertising on television in coming weeks. A pro-Bush super PAC is set to spend $12 million on an advertising campaign to begin running in key states later in the month. , Bush \"knows the contours of this primary will change by late fall and early 2016,\" said Republican operative Leonard Alcivar. \"He also knows his super PAC is weeks away from dropping millions of dollars in positive TV ads and mail highlighting his conservative record as governor.

{"Content": "[ Caption, Close, Republican presidential candidate, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, shown on June 20, said on Thursday: \"Im here to tell you that it is Republicans, not Democrats, who are truly offering black Americans the hope of a better life for themselves and their children.\" Keep clicking to see a timeline of Perrys tenure as governor of Texas. , When Rick Perry departed as Texas governor, after 5,114 days in office, nearly twice as long as anyone else, he insisted he will be remembered for the Lone Star States booming economy that is the envy of other states. And his education initiatives that he said will create a brighter future for Texas children. And tort reform that ensures more doctors are available to provide health care. , Economy: Perrys formula was simple: Low taxes, light regulation and limited services. During Perrys tenure, the state government consistently has spent about 70 percent of the national average per person on services including roads, health care and public education. Texas has an unemployment rate of 5.1 percent and Perry has lured several big companies to move to Texas using the Texas Enterprise Fund. , Schools: To say the outgoing governors record on public education is mixed would be an understatement. Perry started strong, picking up cues from his predecessor and focusing heavily on accountability and outcomes. Critics, however, say many of those gains later were reversed, mostly by budget cuts. Texas fourth graders rank 41st in the nation in reading and their scores have declined by 2 points in 12 years. Eighth graders rank 16th in the nation in mathematics and are in the top 10 for score growth. , Higher Ed: Texas has met many of the higher education goals it set in Closing the Gaps, the long-term higher education plan unveiled in 2000. Last year, Texas public colleges and universities saw enrollment drop by 14,000, a dip that officials blame on rising tuition. Graduation rates have increased 59 percent since 1999, but leaving out Texas top performing schools, UT-Austin and Texas A&M, six-year graduation rates sit around 50 percent. Perrys call for a $10,000 college degree in 2011 has been offered at 13 campuses around the state, as tuition rates have risen elsewhere. The last two years of Perrys tenure have been punctuated by a pitched battle between those who want to fundamentally change the way Texas universities operate, one aspect being the fight between UT Regent Wallace Hall (pictured), who was accused of trying to oust UT President Bill Powers, and the state legislature. ,  Health: In perhaps no other way has Gov. Rick Perrys conservative principles had more impact on Texas than in health and human services. Abortion access has plummeted to historically low levels, medical malpractice lawsuits have become dramatically less common, health insurance rates have remained the lowest in the country and the state agencies overseeing it all have become more consolidated, more politicized and more privatized. , Justice: In 2007, the Texas Legislature, that once employed a lock-em-up-and-throw-away-the-key solution to crime, switched gears to embrace rehabilitation and treatment programs focused on returning criminals to society as productive, taxpaying citizens. These reforms are now touted as a national model, as are changes in police, forensic and prosecutorial procedures designed to curb wrongful convictions, particularly for condemned offenders on death row. Downside on an otherwise upbeat record: Failure to change a juvenile-justice system that still appears to be broken. , Ethics: For a public official currently facing a criminal indictment over the way he vetoed state funding for the states ethics-prosecution unit in June 2013, Perry has drawn national acclaim for signing measures to make state spending more transparent, by making data on state spending available online, and for ordering more accountability over how federal funds are spent. Then, he vetoed a measure last year that would have required greater disclosure about so-called dark money contributed to campaigns. He also received criticism for packing school boards and commissions with big campaign donors and after his campaign donors received grants from a state cancer-research agency that ended up mired in investigations and audits. , Transportation: In, perhaps, Perrys biggest public flop, the Trans Texas Corridor plan he proposed at the start of his tenure as governor was a grandiose scheme to build a 4,000-mile network of transportation links across Texas, incorporating private toll roads, railroads and utility lines into broad lanes of commerce that would take 50 years to build and cost untold billions. Facing strident opposition, Perry ultimately was forced to retreat, signing into law a bill that wiped from state law all references to his grand plan. Texas now has more than 500 miles of toll roads, a majority of which were built during Perrys tenure. More than 6,500 new miles of highway have also been added since Perry took office and Texans have faced no increase in the gas tax since 1993. That good news was tempered by the fact that Texas transportation needs are running about $5 billion short each year, that the oil and gas boom has ruined hundreds of miles of secondary roads in West and South Texas and that traffic congestion in urban areas is at an all-time high. , Environment: Funding for the states environmental watchdog agency has been trimmed 20 percent since 2006, the construction of new coal-fired power plants was fast-tracked and Texas has sued the U.S Environmental Protection Agency 18 times to block additional environmental rules. As Perry departs, Texas leads the nation in emissions of greenhouse gasses: Houston (pictured) and Dallas are still among the most smog-ridden cities in the nation. Nineteen of Texas 254 counties fail to meet federal air-quality standards. , WASHINGTON  Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, struggling to break out of the 2016 GOP presidential primary pack, unleashed a striking speech on race Thursday, saying \"for too long, we Republicans have been content to lose the black vote because we found that we could win elections without it.\", The National Press Club speech, one of the first of his nascent campaign, placed Perry among the more moderate conservatives in the crowded GOP field, confronting issues of race and poverty seldom heard in a contest that has focused on winning over white, blue-collar voters in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. , Facing a media audience lunching on brisket and fried okra, Perry recounted in startling detail the 1916 dismemberment and lynching of Jesse Washington, a 17-year-old mentally disabled youth convicted of rape in Waco. , \"Weve made a lot of progress since 1916,\" Perry said, warming to the theme of racial reconciliation and the importance of mounting fresh Republican proposals to address the lingering problem of black poverty. , Building on his more familiar pitch about the strength of the Texas economy, Perry argued that an economy unleashed from the yoke of government regulations can do more to alleviate poverty than traditional social programs favored by Democrats. , \"Im here to tell you that it is Republicans, not Democrats, who are truly offering black Americans the hope of a better life for themselves and their children,\" he said. , \"I am proud to live in a country with an African-American president,\" Perry added. \"But President Obama cannot be proud of the fact that the prevalence of black poverty has actually increased under his leadership.\", Perry argued that the \"party of Lincoln\" needed to reclaim its legitimacy with African Americans by offering alternatives to anti-poverty programs that he said have failed. Among his proposals were two well-worn Republican ideas: an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit for the working poor, and replacing federal programs with state block grants better tailored to local needs. , One bipartisan proposal: sentencing reforms to help non-violent drug offenders get back on track.Democrats, casting a wary eye on Perrys second-chance campaign, cited Perrys support for stringent voter ID requirements, questioning his appeal to African-American voters. , \"Governor Perry lost moral legitimacy when he signed into law one of the most restrictive voter ID measures in the country that would make it harder for an estimated 600,000 registered Texas voters to vote in person,\" said Michael Tyler, director of African American media for the Democratic National Committee. , Democrats also attacked Perry for his opposition to a federal minimum wage and the expansion of Medicaid in Texas, the state with the highest percentage of uninsured people. , \"Reminding black voters that Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation isnt going to erase Rick Perrys record,\" Tyler said. , Pointing to his record, Perry argued that the poverty rate for blacks in Texas is lower than it is in traditionally Democratic states like New York and California. And he could stand on a recent statistic showing Texas has the nations best graduation rate for black high school students. , More critical to Perrys fortunes will be how his remarks resonate with conservative voters who play an outsized role in the early GOP primaries. \"I am running for president,\" Perry said, \"because I want to make life better for all people, even those who dont vote Republican.\", To Brandon Rottinghaus, associate professor of political science at the University of Houston, Perrys plan appears to be \"more like a wish list than a strategy list.\", \"I think Rick Perry is trying to rebrand the Republican Party in a way that the Party would like to be rebranded,\" Rottinghaus said, \"but that is in political terms very difficult to accomplish. This is especially true for African Americans where they are the most reliable group who vote for Democrats in history.\", Perry nodded to that history. He acknowledged Barry Goldwaters opposition to civil rights as a 1964 Republican presidential candidate, as well as the widespread support for \"states rights\" in the South \"as justification for keeping blacks from the voting booth and the dinner table.\", But he suggested that \"black poverty remains stagnant\" and that Democrats are out of ideas. He cited Obamas recent regulations on overtime pay, which Perry said will cost jobs and hurt African Americans at the bottom of the economic ladder. , Whether the gambit will as a work as a campaign strategy remains to be seen. , \"Its strategically smart for Perry to try to appear to appeal to a new group, but I think its difficult for him because it would imply that he feels he has some segment of the Republican vote locked up, and I dont think thats true,\" Rottinghaus said. \"I think theres no chance that theyre focusing on African American or the minority vote instead of trying to figure out how to appeal more directly to Christian conservatives or small business conservatives.\", Reporter Jennifer Reiley contributed.]", "Date": "20150706", "Title": "[Perry says Republicans are best hope for black prosperity]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Perry-says-Republicans-are-best-hope-for-black-6363602.php", "Author": "[By Kevin Diaz]"}

(Carlos Giusti/El Vocero via AP Photo) PUERTO RICO OUT, SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP)  Puerto Ricos financial crisis loomed over dueling Friday campaign appearances by Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton and Republican Marco Rubio, two presidential contenders with sharply different positions on a key issue for Puerto Rican voters whose influence is growing in U.S. politics. , In a speech delivered entirely in Spanish, Rubio blamed Clinton supporters for the U.S. territorys economic problems as he railed against giving Puerto Rico bankruptcy protection to resolve a staggering $72 billion debt. , \"The people who are rallying behind her today are the people who put Puerto Rico in this fiscal mess to begin with,\" the young Florida senator told about 150 people crammed into an open-air restaurant in San Juans gritty neighborhood of Santurce. , Clinton, who won Puerto Ricos 2008 Democratic primary election, defended her support for giving Puerto Rico bankruptcy protection during a round-table discussion focused on the islands health-care problems. She took an indirect shot at Rubio, charging, \"You cant fix your economy through austerity.\", \"Not a single Republican in Washington has stepped up to support Puerto Rico,\" she told an invitation-only crowd gathered in the islands largest hospital. , Some Republicans describe Clintons policy prescription as a bailout, although others  among them former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush  share her position. , Rubio said the island faces multiple challenges, but remained firm that allowing its municipalities and agencies to declare bankruptcy is not the answer. , \"I dont believe Chapter 9 would solve Puerto Ricos problems,\" he said, adding that the island has spent more money than it had available. \"Ultimately, if there is no other option left, Chapter 9 is a viable option at that point.\", Asked about Clinton at a brief news conference after his speech, Rubio said he didnt have details about her plan for Puerto Rico. , \"I think it was on her server, and it was wiped clean,\" he jabbed, a reference to the Clinton email server that is now the subject of a federal investigation. , The debate could have 2016 implications, even though Puerto Rican residents cant vote for president despite being U.S. citizens. The U.S. territory holds primary contests for both parties that give candidates a chance to connect with Hispanic voters across the nation. , Five million Puerto Ricans live on the U.S. mainland, including nearly 1 million in the key swing state of Florida, and they care about what happens back on the island. , Bush visited in April before announcing his Republican presidential campaign and was warmly received as he praised the contributions of immigrants and endorsed statehood, a long-running issue for generations of Puerto Ricans, many of whom feel like second-class citizens because of their limited voting rights. , Martin OMalley, a Democrat and former Maryland governor who visited last month, pledged to fight for equal treatment, noting that Puerto Rico gets lower Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement rates than the mainland, an issue also on Clintons agenda. , At the round-table discussion, Clinton, with pen and notepad in hand, said she came to \"listen\" and asked questions about reimbursement rates under Medicaid and Medicare, the exodus of doctors from the island and the lack of access Puerto Rican veterans have to full health-care coverage. , \"You cant solve the health care crisis without addressing the economic crisis,\" she said. , The parade of presidential hopefuls to the territory speaks to the growing power of Puerto Rican voters on the mainland, especially in Florida, the top destination for those fleeing the islands 12 percent unemployment rate and nine-year economic slump. The governor declared the massive public debt unpayable and said it needs restructuring. , Historically, Puerto Ricans have sided with Democrats. But Republicans say they do see an opening, at least with recent arrivals, and have been going into Puerto Rican communities for several years to woo potential voters. , Gregorio Matias, a 43-year-old police sergeant, said he decided to fully support Rubio on Friday after reading the Florida senators op-ed opposing bankruptcy protection in the islands largest newspaper. , \"Im going to call all my relatives and tell them to vote for Rubio,\" he said, adding that they live in Florida, New York, New Jersey and Wisconsin. \"Rubio offers what Puerto Rico has been waiting for: that we be treated as equals, not as third-class citizens.\"]", "Date": "20150906", "Title": "[Clinton, Rubio court Puerto Rico voters as crisis looms]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Puerto-Rican-voters-prized-by-Democrats-6484653.php", "Author": "[Sergio Bustos and Danica Coto, Associated Press]"}

John Kasich (KAY-sik) in his own home state, criticizing him for accepting federal Medicaid dollars under President Barack Obamas health care law. , Without ever mentioning Kasich by name, Perry boasted Saturday that as governor of Texas he had refused to take federal dollars, whether Race to the Top education grants or money to expand Medicaid. , \"See, the idea that Washington has this federal pot of Ohio Medicaid money that would have gone to some other state is just nonsense,\" Perry told thousands of activists at the Americans for Prosperity summit in Columbus. \"That money doesnt come from an endless vault of money in Washington. It is borrowed from bankers in China and children in Cleveland and Columbus.\", Kasich was one of the initial Republican governors who expanded Medicaid under the health law, arguing it was Christian to help the poor and his state sends more to Washington than it gets back. The move infuriated conservatives, and though Kasichs office is just down the street he was not invited to the two-day summit. , Kasichs campaign contended in response that one of Perrys budgets was balanced using federal stimulus dollars. ,  Julie Carr Smyth, Columbus, 3:30 p.m. , Florida Sen.

Rubios slow-go campaign strategy is puzzling party operatives in Iowa and New Hampshire, states where voters are used to candidates showering them with attention early and often. , MIAMI (AP)  Republican presidential hopeful Marco Rubios slow-go campaign strategy is puzzling party operatives in Iowa and New Hampshire, states where voters are used to candidates showering them with attention early and often. , While some GOP hopefuls are already highlighting their progress toward visiting all of Iowas 99 counties, Rubios return to the state this week marks his first stop in the caucus battleground in a month. The Florida senator hasnt traveled to New Hampshire, home to the first-in-the-nation primary, since July 4, though he is expected to return before the end of August. , \"Youve had some of the others who have worked it a lot harder,\" said Richard Schwarm, a former Iowa GOP chairman who is uncommitted in the 2016 race. \"I dont think its too late. But I think he should step up the appearances here because we are wide open.\", Fergus Cullen, a former New Hampshire GOP chairman who has yet to back a candidate, said that while Rubio benefits from \"goodwill and interest,\" his infrequent appearances in the state have cost him early endorsements. , \"He would have more if he spent more time here,\" Cullen said. , Rubio has visited New Hampshire just three times since announcing his campaign in early April. His stop in Iowa this week marks his fifth trip to the caucus state as a candidate. , The senators advisers say they see little reason to worry about early state grumbling at this juncture in the campaign. Even after a burst of momentum following his campaign launch and a strong performance in the first GOP debate, Rubios team has said it doesnt expect the young senator to surge until fall or even winter, when voters start paying more attention to the White House race. , On Tuesday, Rubio told reporters his Senate duties and fundraising absorb chunks of his time. But he also suggested it was too early for voters to worry, saying he would be in Iowa often, \"especially as we get closer to the caucuses.\", \"When this election becomes about what it should become about, and that is whats next for America ... I feel very confident about our message,\" Rubio said after speaking to more than 100 people at the Iowa State Fairs political soapbox, a common stop for White House candidates in the early voting state. , But even Rubios return to Iowa was literally dampened by off-and-on downpours, and the umbrella-covered crowd who attended his appearance at the fair was far smaller than those that gathered a day earlier for former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. , Early polling shows Rubio has lost ground this summer while billionaire businessman-turned-presidential candidate Donald Trump has surged, in part by tapping into the publics anger with Washington. , Like some of his rivals, Rubio has spent much of the summer rounding up enough campaign cash to stay competitive in a lengthy primary. Rubios campaign and outside groups supporting him raised a combined $45 million through the second quarter, a strong number but well below the massive haul from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who brought in more than $100 million. , \"We dont expect to have the most money, but we will be competing in all 50 states,\" said Alex Conant, the campaigns spokesman. , Rubio, a first-term senator, has also eschewed the campaign trail at times for hearings and votes on Capitol Hill, where hes taken heat for being absent since launching his White House run in April. , He returned to Washington the day after his campaign launch for a vote on giving Congress a say on President Barack Obamas Iran deal. He also skipped an in-person appearance at a New Hampshire candidate forum earlier this month to vote on legislation to defund Planned Parenthood. He participated in the forum via video instead. , Rubio, a 44-year-old son of Cuban immigrants, is seen by some Republicans as a bright hope for a party desperate to attract younger, more diverse voters. His optimistic, future-focused campaign message already has some Democrats worried that he would be a formidable general election opponent for front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton. , \"I think hes a rising star in the Republican Party,\" Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said. \"I think it would be worth his time to spend a significant amount of time in the state of Iowa.\", Some of Rubios rivals have devoted more time to the early voting states this summer. , Bush, who is counting on a strong performance in New Hampshire to propel his White House hopes, has made six trips to the state since announcing his campaign in mid-June. Ohio Gov. John Kasich has only officially been in the race for a month, but he has already matched Rubios travel to New Hampshire. , Rubio was returning to Iowa this week for an appearance at the state fair Tuesday and the opening of his campaign headquarters in Des Moines on Wednesday. Conant said Rubio would also make stops in New Hampshire, as well as South Carolina and Nevada, by the end of the month. , ", "Date": "20150818", "Title": "[Rubio's slow start in Iowa, New Hampshire puzzles GOP]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Rubio-s-slow-start-in-Iowa-New-Hampshire-puzzles-6450056.php", "Author": "[Julie Pace and Sergio Bustos, Associated Press]"}

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, greets supporters after speaking at the Defending the American Dream summit hosted by Americans for Prosperity at the Greater Columbus Convention Center in Columbus, Ohio, Saturday, Aug. 22, 2015. , COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP)  Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was the hands-down favorite of the Americans for Prosperity annual summit in Columbus, Ohio, this weekend, if the number and volume of ovations during the speeches of five presidential candidates who addressed the annual convention of tea party activists was the measure. , At the other end of the spectrum was former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a newcomer to events financed by conservative industrialists Charles and David Koch. Bush was attending his first national conference of Americans for Prosperity and was greeted with respectful but restrained applause by a group that rose essentially out of Republican dissatisfaction with federal spending under his brother, former President George W. Bush. , Cruz, a tea party favorite since his 2012 election, sparked deafening cheers in the Columbus Convention Center auditorium even before he took the stage, entering to the 1980s power anthem \"Eye of the Tiger.\" During his speech Saturday, he went on to promise to \"repeal every word of Obamacare,\" and\" rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal.\", Each of Cruzs lines was met with applause and cheers from the more than 3,000 activists. Bush, who spoke a day earlier, earned far fewer cheers, and mostly polite applause, from the anti-tax, economic conservative audience from around the country. , David White of Marietta, Ohio, was unimpressed with Bush. , \"He did not articulate any plan for what he intends to do as president,\" said White, of southeastern Ohio. \"He used his time to try and rearrange perception of his record in Florida.\", Bush did stress his experience during eight years as Florida governor, noting tax cuts, reduction in the state government workforce and an overhaul in the states education system. , Cruz, on the other hand, laid out an agenda that consisted entirely of undoing actions taken by Democratic President Barack Obama. , The event is significant because its an opportunity for presidential candidates to impress the conservative group, which spent more than $30 million in advertising against Obamas re-election in 2012 and has activists, donors and organizers in 36 states and an operating budget for 2016 of roughly $125 million. , Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who can trace his 2010 Senate election to tea party support, received hearty cheers, but less robust than Cruz, while taking a more policy-focused approach than Cruzs more political speech. , \"The first thing we must do is become globally competitive again,\" Rubio said, describing the fast-moving economy of the future. \"Thats why we talk about tax reform. Thats why we talk about regulatory reform.\", The two-day conference was also an opportunity for exposure for lesser-known candidates such as Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who rank low in national polls among the field of 17 candidates. The extra exposure could help them rise in national polls, which kept the two from participating in the Aug. 6 debate in Cleveland. , Jindal used much of his speech Friday afternoon to rail against political correctness that he says has diluted the meaning of being American. , Jindals parents immigrated to the United States from India before he was born, and he rallied the vastly white crowd in Columbus to standing cheers with a call for assimilation. , \"I am done with hyphenated Americans,\" Jindal said, using the term to describe African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Asian-Americans. \"Were all Americans, united as one.\", And while Perry was animated and emphatic, he was also the last speaker during the two-day conference. Attendees trying to make their flights home began leaving during Perrys speech, despite impassioned, patriotic rhetoric. , \"America is in desperate need of leadership again,\" Perry said. \"Theyre desperate for a president whose actions speak louder than his words.\", ", "Date": "20150822", "Title": "[Cruz outshines Bush at Americans for Prosperity summit]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/texas/article/Cruz-outshines-Bush-at-Americans-for-Prosperity-6459848.php", "Author": "[Thomas Beaumont, Associated Press]"}

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, speaks to supporters in Oklahoma City, Thursday, Aug. 13, 2015. Cruz is on the final day of a seven-day bus tour through seven southern states. , LITTLE ROCK, Arkansas (AP)  Ted Cruz sees his way to the White House, and it runs between the hedges, through waters patrolled by the \"Volunteer Navy\" and a spot on the Mississippi River nicknamed Death Valley. , Confused? Not if youre one of the voters the Texas senator is counting on to carry him to the Republican presidential nomination. , Theyll know thats all part of college football lore in the Southeastern Conference, whose make-up roughly matches the states that will hold primaries next March  right after the kickoff contests in the four early voting states. , \"The role of Arkansas and the other states throughout the SEC is to make sure the next Republican nominee for president is a real and genuine conservative,\" Cruz told backers this week in Little Rock. , Cruz assures his supporters he is \"all in\" on the early states, which include South Carolina  an SEC state thats accustomed to its prominent role in picking the president. But the \"SEC primary\" is a new phenomenon, with Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas and others moving up their contests to join Georgia for a Southern-tinged Super Tuesday on March 1. , Louisiana and Mississippi host primaries the following week. , The tight turnaround, Cruz said in an interview this week, will make it impossible for second-tier candidates to focus exclusively on Iowa or New Hampshire with hopes that an \"unexpected victory\" can translate into national momentum. , \"Theres so little time ... to raise money, no time to build infrastructure ... no time to energize the grassroots,\" he said. \"Thats why our strategy is very deliberately playing the long game.\", The Southern stretch is unlikely to put any candidate over the top, since the Republican Party requires that delegates selected in contests held before March 15 be split proportionally among leading vote-getters. Only afterward can a state party opt to award all of its delegates to the top vote-getter. , Cruz certainly has competition. Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum won Southern primaries in their previous White House bids, and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and businessman Donald Trump boast notable followings. And Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is from Baton Rouge  the home of Louisiana State. , But Cruz and his aides argue the early March primaries will cull the field ahead of the winner-take-all states, and a strong performance there could pit Cruz as conservative standard-bearer against one or two establishment favorites  defined by the Cruz camp as Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker. , And so Cruz spent his week following the first GOP debate making that pitch at more than a dozen stops on a multi-state bus tour through the South, where he quoted scripture, asked supporters to pray for him and delighted big crowds with his usual broadsides against President Barack Obama, Democratic 2016 favorite Hillary Rodham Clinton and the federal government in general. , \"Theres no doubt its a total package,\" said Arkansas state Rep. Bob Ballinger, a Cruz supporter. \"Hes also a fiscal conservative. He also just understands the people and is willing to vote and work for the people, which is what excites me about him.\", Cruz started his tour in South Carolina and concluded Thursday in Oklahoma, talking college football and tailoring his rallies to local culture: \"Sweet Tea with Sen. Cruz\" in Memphis and a \"Boots and BBQ\" lunch in Oklahoma City. , \"Hes down-the-line everything we stand for, and hes passionate about it,\" said 84-year-old Mary Lou McCoy of Jacksonville, Arkansas. Her husband, 87-year-old Lowell McCoy, stood by in a T-shirt that read: \"liberalism: moochers electing leeches to steal from producers.\", The first-term senator, who built his national profile as a tea party favorite in his 2012 election and subsequent role in partially shuttering the federal government the following year, fills his rallies with humorous takedowns of Obama and Clinton and even GOP leaders. , He takes aim at 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, who publicly chided Cruz for hammering Obama as a \"state-sponsor of radical Islamic terrorism\" because of the administrations nuclear deal with Iran. , \"If we nominate Democrat-lite, we will lose again,\" Cruz said, a line that drew approval from voters at every stop. , ", "Date": "20150813", "Title": "[Ted Cruz sees path to White House running through the South]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/texas/article/Ted-Cruz-sees-path-to-White-House-running-through-6442995.php", "Author": "[Bill Barrow, Associated Press]"}

Ted Cruz enlisted the help of the legislator behind Arkansas religious objections law on Wednesday as the Republican presidential hopeful tried to rally support in rival Mike Huckabees home state. , Cruzs Arkansas campaign is being co-chaired by state Rep. Bob Ballinger, who sponsored a state law aimed at preventing government from infringing on someones religious beliefs without a compelling reason. The measure was quickly rewritten in the final days of the legislative session over concerns an initial version was anti-gay. , Cruz and the other GOP hopefuls defended Arkansas and Indiana, which both faced a backlash over their religious protection measures. Ballinger said Cruzs support for the measure wasnt the main reason for his support, \"Theres no doubt its a total package,\" Ballinger said. \"Hes got that, hes also a fiscal conservative. He also just understands the people and is willing to vote and work for the people, which is what excites me about him.\", The Texas senator touted Arkansas role in the 2016 presidential contest, noting it had joined other southeastern states in moving up their nominating contests to early March. , \"Arkansas is going to play a critical role in the 2016 Republican presidential nomination,\" Cruz told a crowd of hundreds gathered outside the state Republican Partys headquarters in downtown Little Rock. , Touting himself as a \"real and genuine conservative,\" Cruz called for the repeal of the federal health care overhaul and said he would scrap the Common Core education standards that have come under fire from many in his party. , Huckabee, who served 10 years as Arkansas governor, launched his campaign in his hometown of Hope in May. But Republicans hope moving the states primary up to March from May will draw more presidential hopefuls to the state. Billionaire and Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump headlined a fundraiser for the state GOP last month, the day before Democratic hopeful Hillary Rodham Clinton  who served as the states first lady for 12 years  spoke at a state party fundraiser. , Huckabee has won endorsements from most of the states top Republicans, including Gov. Asa Hutchinson and nearly all of the states congressional delegation. But Cruzs \"leadership team\" announced this week includes some former allies of the governor, including Curtis Coleman, who managed Huckabees unsuccessful U.S. Senate bid in 1992. , Cruz also planned stops in Russellville and Van Buren, where he was set to headline the Crawford County Republican Partys Lincoln Day Dinner. The Family Council Action Committee, a conservative group, initially said it planned at the dinner to give \"Power of Courage\" awards to Republican Reps. Charlene Fite and Justin Harris at Wednesdays dinner in honor of legislation they sponsored during this years session. , But later Wednesday, Committee President Jerry Cox said the awards wouldnt be presented to the two lawmakers at the event at the request of the dinners organizers. Crawford County Republican Party Chairman Mark Shaffer said the awards presentation was never part of the dinners program. , Harris earlier this year admitted he gave his adopted daughters to a man who later admitted to sexually abusing one of them, which prompted the Legislature to ban the \"re-homing\" of adopted children. Harris has since announced he wont seek re-election this year. , ", "Date": "20150812", "Title": "[Cruz enlists help of religious objections law's sponsor]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/texas/article/Cruz-enlists-help-of-religious-objections-law-s-6440366.php", "Author": "[Andrew Demillo, Associated Press]"}

From left: Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina, Lindsey Graham, Bobby Jindal, John Kasich, George Pataki, Rick Perry, Rick Santorum, and Scott Walker. (AP Photo/Bill Sikes), Its fight night in America. OK, that might be a bit too much, but it can easily feel that way for anyone who has watched the early machinations of the 2016 race for the White House. After months of staged candidate announcements and prepared speeches before sympathetic crowds, the Republican presidential hopefuls will have their first prolonged unscripted moment. , The Fox debates tonight -- the first at 4 p.m. and the main one at 8 p.m. -- in Cleveland are the official start of the partys attempt to re-take the White House after years of devastating defeats (the 2010 midterm elections notwithstanding). Here are a few things to keep in mind: , * Insider Edition. The many millions who will eventually vote in the general election will likely not be watching. Tonight is not for them. Its for the people who can actually name each person on stage. Bonus points if you know who Jim Gilmore is. Hell be standing on the far left, at the last podium to be exact, on the 4 p.m. debate stage. All of that to say that while political reporters and campaign operatives will be watching the debate closely, and itll give them something to talk about until the next debate, itll be another Thursday night for most Americans. And yet, the non-politicos who do tune in will be hearing the candidates stump speeches and crowd-pleasing zingers for the first time tonight. That also matters. , * Dont blink.This might not actually be a bloodbath, but if it does turn into one, then itll likely happen in an instant. There has been constant chatter since Donald Trumps rise in the Republican field that tonights debate is all but certain to be a free-for-all for attention, a nasty brawl between the bombastic, insult-hurling Trump and his rivals who will have no choice but to respond with force. Should they respond in kind or should they act like the adult in the room? For some of them, who desperately need a good report card after the debate, it might seem appealing to get in a few punches -- if they have to. But Trump might not even go there. Nobody, not even his close advisers, knows what he is going to do tonight. \"Id prefer no conflict, no infighting,\" he told The Washington Post. \"But if they hit me, Ill hit them harder. Its all going to depend on the moment.\" Trump will be at the center podium, perhaps fittingly, like the teacher in a crowded classroom, overshadowing the moderators and ready at a moments notice to give his rivals detention if he feels theyve earned it. , * Its Perrys time to shine. How fitting that the former Texas governor will take the same place on stage at the 4 p.m. debate as Donald Trump will take at the 8 p.m. debate.After weeks of their back-and-forth, both men will arrive in Cleveland with enough pent up energy to set the room on fire. For Perry, this might very well be a blessing, a theory his advisers had shopped around after news broke that he would not make the prime-time debate. More than anyone else, Perry has been willing to attack Trump at every campaign stop. At first, it was an attempt to rise in the polls and get into the debate, but now that thats all settled, Perry has the opportunity to take a different tack. Its unquestionably a time for Perry to pivot. Tonight, he doesnt have to feel obligated to go after Trump in the same way, or at all. Out of sight, out of mind. The former governor presumably knows he cant keep up with The Donald, the GOPs summer entertainer-in-chief, so dont do it anymore. It was fun while it lasted, though. , * What will Texans say? For a Texas angle, look for the debate reaction from elected officials. The incessant comparisons in recent weeks between Rick Perry and Ted Cruzs presidential campaigns have fueled the narrative that they are battling it out for the states major endorsements. Cruz, who will be at the 8 p.m. debate, has some major backing from the states tea party crowd, and they dont seem to be going anywhere. They most certainly wont back Perry, ever. Still, the former governor has tried to boost his endorsements by pursuing blessings from people who still very much animate the Republican Partys base. There was a reason Perrys announcement was heavy on military references, which included shout-outs to Marcus Luttrell, a veteran who survived an attack in Afghanistan, and Taya Kyle, the widow of Chris Kyle, the Texas veteran whose story was immortalized in the film \"American Sniper.\" The Texas contingent will matter much more as the process goes on, and especially when the candidates come here before the March 1 primary. But tonights debate could be a major turning point in how Texas Republicans, several of them well-connected and influential, view the viability of Cruz and Perrys candidacy. , ]", "Date": "20150806", "Title": "[2016's pre-season ends tonight]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/politics/texas-take/article/2016-s-pre-season-ends-tonight-6428894.php", "Author": "[By Bobby Cervantes]"}

Pat Toomey speaks while announcing that he is running for a second six-year term in office, Sunday, Sept. 13, 2015, in King of Prussia, Pa. , KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa. (AP)  Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey is preparing to face what could be his biggest political test yet as he runs for another term in 2016, a presidential election year, when Democrats tend to have more success getting elected in the primarily Democratic state. , Toomeys announcement Sunday at a suburban Philadelphia hotel that he is running for a second term was a formality. His campaign has been up and running for months, raising millions of dollars and airing a TV ad to tout his work on legislation to make it more difficult for would-be child predators to get jobs in schools. , The event, with endorsements from people in law enforcement, business and child protection advocacy, gave a look at how Toomey will characterize his four and a half years in office. As a campaign video played at the event put it, Toomey is \"getting things done for Pennsylvania\" and often working with Democrats to do it. , Toomey told a crowd of more than 100 people in the hotel ballroom about his experience in the Senate, saying hes learned its difficult to get things done in Washington partly because of a polarized political environment. , \"Its a challenging environment for all of us,\" he said. \"But Ive learned that it is possible to get things done if youre willing to stick to your principles but look for common ground at the same time.\", Accomplishments, according to the campaign, include working with Democrats on a package of 2012 legislation that relaxed regulations on small- and medium-size businesses to help them raise capital and grow. , Toomey, 53, is popular with business, anti-tax and free-market advocacy groups. Hes framing his fiscal conservatism as a populist and bipartisan fight against wasteful spending of tax dollars and corporate welfare. , That will compete with the Democrats version of a fiscal conservative who has opposed their efforts to increase the federal minimum wage and backed Republican plans in Congress to halt federal dollars for Planned Parenthood and overhaul traditional Medicare coverage into a subsidy-based health insurance option on the open market. , The American Conservative Union gives Toomey a lifetime 94 rating through 2014, ranking him the second-most conservative Pennsylvania member of Congress in office last year, after U.S. Rep. Joe Pitts. , After Toomeys 20-minute speech, he downplayed the notion that 2016 will be markedly more difficult for him than 2010. In 2010, Toomey narrowly won his first term, beating Democratic former U.S. Rep. Joe Sestak by 2 percentage points, when a midterm Republican wave helped the GOP pick up 69 seats in Congress. , \"This is Pennsylvania, so I assume this is going to be a very competitive race,\" Toomey said. \"But we will be prepared for it. We will run strong, and Im confident were going to win.\", In a presidential election year, more registered voters turn out at the polls, and Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 4-3 ratio in Pennsylvania. Democrats believe the higher voter turnout means a better shot at winning for their candidates. The state has supported Democratic candidates for president in six straight elections. , Toomey, who lives in the Allentown area, is unopposed for the Republican nomination and has a unified party behind him. A Quinnipiac University poll in June showed him leading Sestak, 47 percent to 36 percent. , Including Sestak, Democrats have a field of at least three challengers seeking the partys nomination in the April 26 primary election. , Sestak, a former Navy vice admiral, declared in March that he would seek a rematch with Toomey. Katie McGinty, who has held high-level posts in state and federal government, joined the hunt in August. Braddock Mayor John Fetterman said Friday that he will run. , Before joining the Senate, the Harvard University-educated Toomey helped start a restaurant chain, worked in investment banking and headed the Washington, D.C.-based Club for Growth, which advocates for free markets, less government regulation and lower taxes. He also served three terms in the U.S. House, representing the Allentown area, and ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate in 2004, losing narrowly in the GOP primary to the late Arlen Specter.]", "Date": "20150913", "Title": "[Toomey's 1st re-election bid could be his biggest test yet]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/article/Toomey-s-first-re-election-bid-could-be-his-6502021.php", "Author": "[Marc Levy, Associated Press]"}

Rick Perry is advocating a crack-down on so-called \"sanctuary cities\"places in the United States where local law enforcement dont scrutinize the immigration status of criminal suspects. , On Thursday, Perry released a statement calling for blocks on certain federal grants and revocation of certain federal funding from sanctuary cities. Subsequent reports show hes taking his call to the campaign trail. , \"Federal taxpayers shouldnt be forced to subsidize the irresponsible behavior of these governments,\" he said in a statement. , A July 2015 analysis by the right-leaning think tank Center for Immigration Studies named just one Texas sanctuary: Travis County  home to Austin. Other voices, notably Perry before his previous presidential bid, put the label on Houston, where police department policy prohibits officers from inquiring on suspects immigration status. , But it remains unclear just what constitutes a sanctuary city. On one far side of the spectrum are the jurisdictions that have denied federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement requests to turn over suspected illegal immigrants. An October 2014 release from the Department of Homeland Security said 270 jurisdictions had done so. , On the other side is the State of Arizona, which in 2012 enacted legislation requiring police to check the immigration status of suspected illegal immigrants. , The threshold of a sanctuary city lies somewhere between those two extremes. , In March, state Sen. Charles Perry (R-Lubbock) introduced legislation reflective of Perrys pushit would have cut off certain state funding from local governments that adopted sanctuary city policies. And it mirrors the 2010 race for Texas governor, when Perry alleged that his democratic opponent, former Houston Mayor Bill White, ran a sanctuary in the Bayou City. , But White, as well as current mayor Annise Parker, contested that claim. , \"Houston is not a sanctuary city,\" Parker told the Texas Tribune in 2010. \"If you break a law in Houston, we will arrest you, we will take you to jail, and if youre in this country illegally, we will turn you over to the appropriate federal agency, generally ICE.\", In that way, Houston does not mesh with the American jurisdictions that decline to turn immigrants over to federal authorities. But Houston police are also forbidden from inquiring the immigration status of a suspect who has not yet been charged with a crime, a Houston Police Department spokesman said. , Supporters of sanctuary city policies call them good for business, which in many states relies heavily on immigrant labor, and also allege that requiring local police to enforce federal immigration policy would encourage immigrants to hide from local police and not to come forward with crime reports. , Opponents say holding non-citizens in U.S. jails puts an unfair burden on American taxpayers, clogs the immigration system for those pursuing a legal route to immigration and allows individuals with criminal records in other countries to wander freely and dangerously in the United States. , Under Perrys proposal, sanctuary cities would lose federal State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, which helps cities cover the costs of jailing undocumented immigrants. States with sanctuary cities would also lost some SCAAP funding based on the number of sanctuary cities in their borders. , He did not specify how a sanctuary city would be defined.]", "Date": "20150714", "Title": "[Perry proposes cutting federal funding to sanctuary cities  like Houston, Austin?]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/texas/article/Perry-proposes-cutting-federal-funding-to-6384247.php", "Author": "[Dylan Baddour, Houston Chronicle]"}

{"Content": "[ Caption, Close, San Antonio Mayor Ivy Taylor  (Photo by Rick Kern/Getty Images for HISTORY), Our big-city neighbor to the west elected a mayor last Saturday. Appointed Mayor Ivy Taylor became San Antonios first-ever elected African-American mayor, defeating in a runoff former state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte. , Van de Putte, who also was the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor last fall, won the general election with about 1,700 more votes than Taylor, with neither reaching the 50 percent margin to avoid a runoff. On Saturday, Taylor prevailed with 52 percent of the votes. , A number of factors unique to San Antonio helps explain Taylors solid victory, and yet as Houston begins to pay attention to its own mayors race, some potential similarities are worth noting. The most obvious is turnout, or the lack thereof, particularly when it comes to Hispanic voters. , In its general election, San Antonio fielded four capable and experienced candidates who represented a fairly broad demographic spectrum - an African-American woman with City Council and mayoral experience; a Mexican-American woman with 20 years of experience in the Texas Legislature; a Mexican-American male who, like Van de Putte, has held leadership positions in the Legislature; an Anglo male with years of experience in county government. ,  Although San Antonios municipal elections are officially nonpartisan, all four candidates in the race were Democrats at various points on the conservative-to-liberal spectrum. Taylor, a Yale-educated urban planning professor, was arguably the most conservative of the four. , Despite a decent quartet of candidates from which to choose, only 12 percent of registered voters in a city of 1.3 million chose to exercise their vote in the general election, 14 percent in the runoff. That pathetic percentage means that roughly 9 out of 10 registered voters found something better to do than participate in self-government for their city. , Low voter turnout is a problem Houston also has had in its own municipal elections and is likely to have again despite a diverse and interesting cadre of candidates. Except for the unfortunate fact that no female is running this time, the Houston mayoral candidates include an experienced City Council member; a former sheriff; a longtime leader in the Texas Legislature; a former small-town mayor and newspaper columnist; a former congressman and gubernatorial candidate; a former city attorney, and a businessman. Candidates include two African-Americans and one Hispanic. , In San Antonio, a majority Hispanic city, turnout among Hispanic voters was particularly dismal. Taylor relied on North Side conservatives and evangelical voters who approved of her 2013 vote against a controversial nondiscrimination ordinance protecting the citys gay community, as well as her vote against a downtown street car system. Van de Puttes campaign manager said thousands of new voters participated in the runoff election, many of them Republicans who werent voting for Taylor as much as they were voting against her opponent. , Van de Putte, who would have been the citys first Latina mayor, relied on Hispanic voters, who tend to vote 3-1 Democratic in San Antonio. They let her down. , That pattern of Hispanic non-participation is a statewide problem. In fact, Hispanic turnout in Texas tends to be lower than elsewhere in the country. Its likely to continue in Houston too, unless some candidate or some issue galvanizes the electorate. Its hard to see who or what that might be, even though they probably could elect a candidate of their choosing, in Houston and elsewhere, if they voted in percentages comparable to African-Americans and Anglos. , Meanwhile, in the words of San Antonio Express-News columnist O. Ricardo Pimentel, we have \"a government elected by the minority, their elections funded by an even tinier sliver of a wealthy minority and all allowed by the non-voting majority.\", Pimentel is talking about America in general, not just San Antonio. Regardless of who won last Saturday in the Alamo City, thats not the way democracy is supposed to work. ]", "Date": "20150617", "Title": "[What will it take?]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/editorials/article/What-will-it-take-6333872.php", "Author": "[Copyright 2015: Houston Chronicle]"}

The first will encompass areas in which rapid progress is expected, such as cooperation on naval matters, climate change and the environment. The second will tackle more complex topics like the establishment of direct airline flights and U.S. telecommunications deals with Cuba. The last will take on the toughest problems, including the embargo, human rights and each countrys desire to have fugitives returned by the other. , While the three tracks will proceed simultaneously, Kerry said, Cuban leaders should not expect to see progress on the embargo without improvements in civil liberties in Cuba, which does not allow independent media, political parties other than the ruling communist party or direct election of anything but low-level municipal posts. , \"There is no way Congress will lift the embargo if we are not making progress on issues of conscience,\" he said. , Kerry began the day with a nationally broadcast call for democratic change on the island, saying that \"we remain convinced the people of Cuba would be best served by a genuine democracy, where people are free to choose their leaders, express their ideas, practice their faith.\", Hundreds of Cubans mixed with American tourists outside the former U.S. Interests Section, newly rechristened with a sign announcing \"Embassy of the United States of America.\" They cheered as Kerry spoke, the United States Army Brass Quintet played \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and U.S. Marines raised the flag outside the building, which overlooks the famous Malecon seaside promenade. , Addressing reporters with Kerry after the ceremony, Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez responded by indignantly opening his remarks with complaints of U.S. human rights transgressions  from police shootings of black men to mistreatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, the U.S. naval base on Cuba that the government says must be returned. , \"Cuba isnt a place where theres racial discrimination, police brutality or deaths resulting from those problems,\" Rodriguez said. \"The territory where torture occurs and people are held in legal limbo isnt under Cuban jurisdiction.\", Many Cubans disagree with that assessment, including Afro-Cubans who say discrimination is still rampant despite the revolutions egalitarian ideals. Human rights groups say regular, short-term arrests and beatings of the governments critics seek to intimidate dissent. , President Barack Obama also called for change in Cuba when he announced the new U.S. policy of engagement in December, but his words were less pointed than Kerrys on Friday. , Cuba formally reopened its Washington embassy last month. The U.S. raised its flag in Havana then, too, though saving the formal ceremony for Kerrys visit.

Hes making it clear that regardless of the cases outcome, hell keep pressing the issue. , \"I believe 2016 will be the religious liberty election,\" Cruz said at a gathering of faith activists in Washington last week. \"Religious liberty has never been more threatened in America than right now today.\", Cruz has legislative, political and fund-raising motivation. In the Senate, hes sponsoring a constitutional amendment shielding states that still bar gay marriage, and hes already attacking his competitors. In his speech last week, he derided Republicans who werent supportive of religious liberty laws in Indiana and Arkansas that opponents said would allow businesses to discriminate against gay customers. , \"Ill tell you what was saddest, just how many Republicans ran for the hills,\" Cruz said, adding that Indiana was \"a time for choosing.\", Cruzs legislative challenge is going nowhere fast, given that it requires a two-thirds majority of both chambers of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the state legislatures to amend the Constitution. But by using his power to sponsor legislation, he can distinguish himself from other conservatives in the crowded 2016 presidential field. That may help him with the partys coveted evangelical base. , In the process, Cruz can also create headaches for more centrist (and more front-of-the-pack) candidates such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who need to get through the nominating process without having to take stands that could hurt them in a general election. , Underlining the concerns of some party strategists, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, also among the Republican fields top-polling candidates, recently threw his support behind a constitutional amendment to allow states to ban gay marriage. , Congressional Republican leaders are using megaphones to blast President Barack Obamas health care law, which also figures in a major case the court will decide by the end of June. By contrast, theyve been practically silent on gay marriage. , The same goes for Bush and Rubio. Its a reflection of the partys desire to downplay a matter on which polls show they are at odds with the public. A Gallup poll in May found that a record 60 percent of Americans support gay marriage. , \"The reality is the ground is shifting on this issue because of people getting to know more about the fact that, for the vast majority of people, this is not a choice, this is who they are,\" Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican whose son is gay and who supports gay marriage, said in an interview. \"Most of the candidates are not talking about it, which is different than it would have been eight years ago.\", On the other side of the debate, Gary Bauer, president of American Values and one of the nations most vocal social conservatives, agrees that \"the party establishment and some of the donor base is very uncomfortable with these issues.\", \"What they need to ponder is the very real chance of demoralization among voters that care about these issues that would suppress voter turnout,\" Bauer said. , As a senator, Cruz can introduce legislation on gay marriage, but there are other Republican candidates who are competing for the evangelical vote and who are eager to make an issue of gay marriage. , In May, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal signed a religious freedom executive order. Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, is promising to fight \"judicial tyranny\" and calling on his fellow candidates to join him. , \"If you lack the backbone to reject judicial tyranny and fight for religious liberty, you have no business serving our nation as president of the United States,\" Huckabee said in a letter last week to more than 100 conservative leaders and organizations. , Cruz and the others are backed by activists who say the gay marriage debate is a part of a broader assault on religious liberty that will eventually strip them of their ability to openly practice their beliefs. , Religious leaders are concerned the ruling will force Catholic and other religious-based adoption services to give same-sex couples equal preference, Bauer said. \"The battle is morphing away from just the question of the definition of marriage,\" he said. \"Thats going to be a huge battle that is likely to be very divisive.\", Iowa Rep. Steve King, a Republican who is heavily courted by Republican presidential candidates because hes from the state where the first ballots of the presidential election will be cast, has called for \"civil disobedience\" if the court rules in favor of same-sex marriages. The National Organization for Marriage is urging all the Republican candidates for the 2016 presidential nomination to sign a pledge promising to support a constitutional amendment similar to what Cruz has proposed defining marriage as between one man and one woman. And the Southern Baptist Convention says it will reject any ruling affirming gay marriage. , Meanwhile, other Republicans are making clear its a fight theyd rather not have. During last weeks Faith & Freedom Coalition meeting in Washington, D.C. , Cruz was the only 2016 candidate to aggressively address the gay marriage issue. , Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican facing a tough reelection battle, said his priorities are addressing the nations debt and deficit and turning back Obamacare. , Once the court rules, \"I would move on,\" he said in an interview. \"The Supreme Court rulings are pretty definitive. They just are.\", That wont be easy to do for the 2016 field of Republicans because of voters like Linda Cleaver of Cochranville, Pa. , a member of the Faith & Freedom Coalition. , \"It will go everywhere and affect everything,\" she said of the ruling. \"Its Bill of Rights time,\" she said in rejecting the argument that forcing Bush, Rubio and Walker into an aggressive posture against gay marriage will hurt them if they become the partys nominee. , \"I dont care what they think,\" she said of Republican strategists who argue the party has a better chance of winning the White House if it avoids divisive social issues. \"They have their opinion, but theyre out of touch.\", , 2015 Bloomberg News]", "Date": "20150624", "Title": "[Why Ted Cruz isnt giving up the gay marriage fight]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/article/Why-Ted-Cruz-isn-t-giving-up-the-gay-marriage-6347456.php", "Author": "[Heidi Przybyla, Bloomberg News (TNS)]"}

Randy Neugebauer of Lubbock, donated $10 million to \"Keep the Promise II,\" one of four PACs by the same name that back Cruz. , Another PAC, \"Keep the Promise III,\" received $15 million from a single family made up of energy executives Farris and Daniel Wilks and their wives. , \"Keep the Promise I\" received $11 million from hedge fund investor Robert Mercer. , Between them, the six wealthy donors accounted for $36 million of the $37 million raised by PACs supporting Cruz in the last six months. The sum stands in contrast to Cruzs campaign, which raised $14.3 million through 175,000 contributions, averaging $81 a piece. , Neugebauer is the co-founder of Quantum Energy Partners, a Houston-based private equity firm in the energy industry. According to Bloomberg News, the firm has managed more than $7 billion in contracts since 1998. Neugebauer is heavily involved in the energy industry, serving as an investment banker or director for a number of companies including Meritage Energy Partners, LLC, QR Energy and Texoil, Inc. , He has been referred to in the past by Cruz as a \"key moneyman in the super PACs.\" Cruz is not the first GOP candidate Neugebauer has supported. According to Texans for Public Justice, he donated $110,000 to Rick Perry sometime between 2001 and 2010. , The Wilks brothers, from Cisco, Texas, are co-founders of Frac Tech. The hydraulic fracturing company started in 2002 and was then sold by the brothers in 2011 for $3.5 billion. Worth about $1.35 billion each, the brothers started as masons in 1995 but switched to the energy business during the fracking boom. Now they are in the process of buying ranches, including the 62,000-acre N Bar Ranch in Montana for $45 million, according to Forbes. , Farris Wilks, a pastor in Cisco, told CNN in a statement last week that Ted Cruz is a strong conservative leader. , \"Unless we elect a principled conservative leader ready to stand up for our values, well look back on what once was the land of opportunity and pass on a less prosperous nation to our children and grandchildren,\" Farris Wilks said. \"Thats why we need Ted Cruz.\", Outside of Texas, New York resident Mercer started at IBM as a programmer, and then worked at Renaissance Technologies, an investment management company. He became rich by using computer patterns to \"outsmart the stock market,\" according to the New York Times. He has been a longtime supporter of Republican candidates, funding attack ads against Democratic candidates. , Last year, Neugebauer moved to Puerto Rico, which according to public reports drew some questions as the U.S. territory requires minimal taxes for American citizens. Neugebauer said the move was for the benefit of his sons education. , \"I wouldnt have moved for the taxes, but it is an interesting proposition,\" he told Bloomberg in 2014.]", "Date": "20150731", "Title": "[A few wealthy donors boost PACs backing Cruz]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Houston-investor-donates-almost-a-third-of-Cruz-6417505.php", "Author": "[Jennifer Reiley, Houston Chronicle]"}

A few weeks later, Congress likely will need to vote to raise the debt ceiling so that the government can borrow money to meet its existing financial commitments. , The White House, in a statement Thursday evening, said Obama \"reiterated that threats by some Republicans to shut down the government and eliminate access to health care for men, women and families across the country is a game of chicken with our economy that we cannot accept.\", Obamas meeting with Sen. Harry Reid and Rep. Nancy Pelosi occurred as the Senates top Republican, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, is promising there will be no government shutdown. McConnell reiterated Wednesday that there will be a negotiation with the White House over easing cuts to both the Pentagon and domestic programs, a key demand of Obamas. And he predicted for the first time that they would \"crack\" budget caps set by a 2011 budget-cutting law. , The White House has repeatedly threatened to veto any spending bill that keeps the automatic spending curbs, also referred to as sequestration. In a speech to business leaders Wednesday, Obama told Congress to aim higher than just passing a budget. , \"If we dont reverse the cuts that are currently in place, a lot of the drivers of growth that your companies depend on  research, job training, infrastructure, education for our workforce  they are going to be reduced effectively at a time when other countries around the world are racing to get ahead of us,\" Obama told members of the Business Roundtable, a group of CEOs from large companies. , Obama made clear in his speech to the Business Roundtable that he will blame Republicans for any impasse that results in a government shutdown or leads to the impression there will be one, creating stress in the markets. , \"Youll recall two years ago Republicans shut down the government because they didnt like Obamacare. Today, some are suggesting the government should be shut down because they dont like Planned Parenthood,\" Obama said. \"Thats not good sense, and its not good business.\", The president followed up his speech with a fundraising email to Democratic supporters Thursday. In it, he urged contributions to help elect Democrats to \"a Congress that wont play politics with peoples lives,\" and called the current budget standoff \"unacceptable.\", To reach a deal, the GOP-led Congress must take steps that include overcoming opposition from some lawmakers who want to block federal funding for Planned Parenthood, amid controversy about the organization providing fetal tissue from abortions for research. Some conservatives also face pressure to keep government spending within the levels agreed to through the 2011 legislation. , \"Hard-working Americans deserve to have their policymakers live up to their promises on spending,\" said a letter to members of Congress signed by numerous conservative groups, including the Club for Growth, Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce and Americans for Tax Reform. , The letter said that \"even with these modest spending limits, discretionary spending will still increase in 2016 and every year thereafter.\", Going into the budget showdown, Obama is trying to make the case that the economy has greatly improved and that Congress shouldnt do anything that would jeopardize economic growth. , \"Americas winning right now.

The CIAs insistence that it did not spy on its Senate overseers collapsed July 31 with the release of a stark report by the agencys internal watchdog documenting improper computer surveillance and obstructionist behavior by CIA officers. Feinstein said in a statement: \"The investigation confirmed what I said on the Senate floor in March  CIA personnel inappropriately searched Senate intelligence committee computers in violation of an agreement we had reached, and I believe in violation of the constitutional separation of powers.\" (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File), The outcome of a handful of too-close-to-call Senate races in November  including one where the Democratic Party isnt even fielding a candidate  will determine whether Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer are still shaping the national debate on terrorism and climate change next year. , After more than two decades in office, Californias veteran Democratic senators have reached the top rungs of the seniority ladder, and with that the leadership of powerful committees  positions they would lose if Republicans win control of Congress upper chamber. , Boxer, a key backer of the administrations controversial plan to cut carbon emissions from power plants, would cede the helm of the Environment and Public Works Committee to climate-change denier Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma. , Feinstein would lose the chairmanship of the Intelligence Committee, where she has spearheaded a multiyear fight against the CIA to expose torture practices during the George W. Bush administration  a campaign that Republicans have boycotted. , Feinstein, who long has played a central role in Californias water fights, would also cede the chairmanship of the energy and water panel of the Appropriations Committee, which has given her outsize clout on water issues. The panel controls spending on every water project in the country. , Boxer speculation, The possibility that Republicans will gain control of the Senate has fueled speculation that Boxer, 73, wont run for re-election in 2016. Boxer has said only that shell decide next year. , I have served half the time in the majority and half the time in the minority, said Boxer, who was first elected to the Senate in 1992. I really like the majority much better. Much, much better. , Feinstein, who like Boxer was first elected in 1992, is 81 and isnt due to run for re-election until 2018. , Its hard to believe at the end of your career you want to go back into opposition again, said Stanford University political scientist Bruce Cain, especially for someone like Dianne Feinstein, who has such a critical role in security matters and has been at center of debates about national security and surveillance. , President Obamas unpopularity is causing problems for Democrats nationwide, troubles that are compounded by a Senate election map that tilts sharply toward Republicans. Democrats are defending 21 seats in November, almost half of them in states that GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney carried in 2012. Republicans are defending just 15 seats, all but one of them in states Romney won. , Democrats now have a 55-seat working majority, with two independents, Sens. Angus King of Maine and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, allied with them. Political handicappers are predicting a GOP gain of between five and eight seats. , With a five-seat loss, Democrats could retain Senate control with Vice President Joe Biden, the titular Senate president, able to cast a tie-breaking vote. That would also allow Feinstein and Boxer to keep their committee leadership posts. , Things were looking grim for Democrats until, paradoxically, their Senate candidate in Kansas dropped out  leaving 78-year-old GOP Sen. Pat Roberts, a 33-year veteran, facing an independent centrist in what has become the most fascinating contest in the country. , After making a hard-right swing to fend off a Tea Party primary challenge, Roberts now faces Greg Orman, a wealthy self-made businessman who is leading by six to 10 points in the latest polls. Roberts has summoned Kansas legend Bob Dole, a former GOP presidential nominee and Senate majority leader who is now 91 and in a wheelchair, to reinforce his flagging campaign. , North Carolina Dem leading, In red-leaning North Carolina, which Obama won in 2008 but lost in the last election, Democratic incumbent freshman Sen. Kay Hagan is holding a surprisingly strong lead. Boxer cites the race in estimating that the Democrats have a 55 percent chance of keeping their majority. , Iowa has been in a dead heat but is now trending Republican. Contests in Georgia, Alaska, Arkansas and Colorado are very close. Republicans look set to pick up open seats in West Virginia, Montana and South Dakota, where Democrats retired, and Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu is in a tough re-election fight in deep-red Louisiana. , Potential runoffs in Louisiana and Georgia, and a question about which party Orman would caucus with should he win in Kansas, could leave the question of Senate control hanging until December. , As far as legislation goes, however, party control has less meaning than it used to before filibusters became routine, requiring a 60-vote supermajority on most bills. If they return to the minority, Democrats could use the filibuster to block Republican legislation. But if the Democrats hang on, its doubtful theyll be able to push through more than they can now on such Obama priorities as climate-change reforms. , Its fair to say that whoever takes control in the next few years, Congress is not going to be passing landmark, controversial environmental legislation, said Jack Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College. , Even in the minority, Boxer and Feinstein would still have big voices. , Theres no question when you lose control of the House, it sucks completely, Cain said. At least in the Senate, youve got the talk shows, youre one of a smaller number of people, you can get more media attention, youve got longer terms of office, so you dont have to raise money every single cycle. , The main change from committee control would be to give Republicans the power to make trouble for the Obama administration. Instead of Boxers frequent hearings calling attention to the threat of climate change, for example, Republicans could be expected to attack the administrations new rule to require power plants to reduce carbon emissions. , Its not like Democrats are able right now to promote an active legislative agenda, said UC Berkeley political scientist Eric Schickler. Its more in terms of steering the public agenda and the public conversation, and deciding what gets investigated and what doesnt. , GOPs focus on presidency, Republicans are widely expected to use a new Senate majority, should they get it, to focus on the 2016 presidential race rather than any lawmaking. That will be especially true on Boxers Environment and Public Works Committee, said Jim Manley, a former top aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. , given that climate change is among the areas of starkest differences between the parties. , Republicans are going to have the megaphone, the platform, the ability to call witnesses, to set the legislative agenda, Manley said. Theyll be looking, on that committee in particular, try to do what they can to protect their presidential nominees as we move toward 2016. , Carolyn Lochhead is The San Francisco Chronicles Washington correspondent.

{"Content": "[ Caption, Close, Senator John Cornyn speaks during an interview at the Houston Chronicle, Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2014, in Houston. (Cody Duty / Houston Chronicle), The story of U.S. Sen. John Cornyn is one of a slow and steady ascension to power. From district judge in San Antonio to minority whip in the U.S. Senate, Texas senior senator now has his eye on majority leader. That position has a special significance to Texans - it was once held by Lyndon B. Johnson - and Cornyn isnt afraid to name drop that former president along the way. , This election isnt likely to serve as a road bump to any grand plans. Democratic challenger David Alameel, a multimillionaire dentist and investor, has a lot of money, a biography straight out of Horatio Alger and an anachronistic opposition to free trade. The incumbent earns an endorsement almost by default. Telegenic and well-spoken, Cornyn, 62, is practically a casting call model for a third-term senator, which he will become upon re-election. Polls show Republicans on the verge of taking the Senate, and Cornyns seniority stands to help promote Texas interests in our nations capital. , But voters should know that Cornyn is a Republican first and a Texan second. For a man who has served in elected office since 1986, Cornyn remains unfocused on issues of importance to Houston and the Gulf Coast. , Meeting with the Chronicle editorial board, it seemed as if coastal storm surge protection was a new topic for Texas senior senator. When asked about his position on the Ike Dike, Cornyn responded, \"I dont even know what that is.\" , Discussing the nuances of exporting crude, Cornyn admitted, \"I dont pretend to understand these things.\", Houston is the energy capital of the world and our representatives should bring that expertise to Washington. Instead, the authority is yielded to senators from Louisiana and Alaska. , When pushed by the editorial board to name Texas-specific accomplishments, Cornyn had to reach back to his days as the state attorney general. Twelve years in our nations capital should merit at least one notable win. Former Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison sat on the Appropriations Committee with the specific intent of pulling down federal resources to support Texas needs. There are ways to serve Texas in the Senate besides returning our tax dollars, but Cornyn seems more comfortable hammering wedge issues like abortion than fighting for NASA, the Texas Medical Center, the Port of Houston and other jewels of the Texas economy. He pointed to the national debt as a reason for his lackluster performance - it is hard to bring down dollars when you want to cut spending. But after raising that challenge of routine budget deficits, he offered no solutions to balancing the budget beyond a milquetoast reference to another senators plan. , It isnt all bad. Cornyn found himself at Houstons City Hall this week to tout his role in reducing the backlog of untested DNA in rape test kits - a problem that Houston faced for far too long. , In the realm of international relations, Cornyn co-founded the Senate India Caucus back in 2004 and serves as its co-chair today, working to strengthen ties with the worlds largest democracy. Texas has a surprisingly high stake in those bilateral relationships, given Indias hunger for U.S. natural gas. , Cornyn has also maintained a steady position as a moderate Republican voice on immigration issues, seeking solutions over grandstanding. There is no secret about Cornyns disdain for the attention-getting antics of his junior Senate colleague - Sen. Ted Cruz - and he is the first to recognize that Congress is unpopular for a reason. , But if Cornyn wants to offer a real alternative to The Party of No, he will have to step up his game. Power is on the horizon for Cornyn; we hope he uses it wisely.]", "Date": "20141008", "Title": "[For U.S. Senate: Cornyn]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/recommendations/article/For-U-S-Senate-Cornyn-5807713.php", "Author": "[Copyright 2014: Houston Chronicle]"}

He was 75. , ATLANTA (AP)  Julian Bonds life traced the arc of the civil rights movement, from his efforts as a militant young man to start a student protest group all the way to the top leadership post at the NAACP. , Year after year, the calm, telegenic Bond was one of the nations most poetic voices for equality, inspiring fellow activists with his words in the 1960s and sharing the movements vision with succeeding generations as a speaker and academic. He died Saturday at 75. , Former Ambassador Andrew Young said Bonds legacy would be as a \"lifetime struggler.\", \"He started when he was about 17 and he went to 75,\" Young said. \"And I dont know a single time when he was not involved in some phase of the civil rights movement.\", Bond died in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, after a brief illness, according to a statement issued Sunday by the Southern Poverty Law Center, an advocacy group that he founded in 1971 and helped oversee for the rest of his life. His wife, Pamela Horowitz, said Bond suffered from vascular disease. , Her husband, she said, \"never took his eyes off the prize and that was always racial equality.\", The son of a college president burst into the national consciousness after helping to start the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, where he rubbed shoulders with committee leaders Stokely Carmichael and John Lewis. As the committee grew into one of the movements most important groups, the young Bond dropped out of Morehouse College in Atlanta to serve as communications director. He later returned and completed his degree in 1971. , Bond was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1965, but fellow lawmakers, many of them white, refused to let him take his seat because of his anti-war stance on Vietnam. The case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in his favor. Bond finally took office in 1967. , \"If this was another movement, they would call him the PR man, because he was the one who wrote the best, who framed the issues the best. He was called upon time and again to write it, to express it,\" said Eleanor Holmes Norton, who was Bonds colleague on the student committee and later wrote a friend-of-the-court brief for the American Civil Liberties Union when Bonds case was before the high court. , President Barack Obama called Bond \"a hero.\", \"Justice and equality was the mission that spanned his life,\" Obama said in a statement. \"Julian Bond helped change this country for the better.\", In 1968, he led a delegation to the Democratic National Convention, where his name was placed in nomination for the vice presidency, but he declined because he was too young. , He served in the Georgia House until 1975 and then served six terms in the Georgia Senate until 1986. He also served as president of the law center from its founding until 1979 and was later on its board of directors. , Bond was elected board chairman of the NAACP in 1998 and served for 10 years. , He was known for his intellect and his even keel, even in the most emotional situations, Young said. , \"When everybody else was getting worked up, I could find in Julian a cool serious analysis of what was going on,\" Young said. , In the most intense debates, Bond was \"always a gentleman\" and never mean, his wife said. , Bond was often at the forefront of protests. In 1960, he helped organize a sit-in involving Atlanta college students at the city hall cafeteria. , \"We never thought that he really would participate and be arrested because he was always so laid back and cool, but he joined in with us,\" recalled Carolyn Long Banks, now 74, who said Bond never sought much recognition in those early years. , Bond was \"a thinker as well as a doer. He was a writer as well as a young philosopher,\" said Charlayne Hunter-Gault, a journalist who struck up a friendship with Bond in the early 1960s, when she was one of the first two black students to attend the University of Georgia. At the time, Bond was an activist in Atlanta with the newly formed committee. , His eloquence and sense of humor \"really helped sustain the young people in the civil rights movement.\", Hunter-Gault said she hopes a new generation of activists draws lessons from Bonds life and work as they embrace the Black Lives Matter movement. , \"Everybody is not going to be out there in the street with their hands up or shouting,\" she said. \"Thereve got to be people like Julian who participate and observe and combine those two things for action and change that make a difference.\", Morris Dees, co-founder of the law center, said the nation lost one of its most passionate voices for justice. , \"He advocated not just for African-Americans but for every group, indeed every person subject to oppression and discrimination, because he recognized the common humanity in us all,\" Dees said. , After leading the NAACP, Bond stayed active in Democratic politics. He also made regular appearances on the lecture circuit and on television and taught at several universities. , Horace Julian Bond was born Jan. 14, 1940, in Nashville, Tennessee.

Greg Abbott on Thursday appointed home schooling advocate and former Dan Patrick campaign manager Donna Bahorich to chair the State Board of Education. , The choice already is sowing dissent among the boards Republican factions as the 15-member panel enters a period in which it could be making a number of contentious policy decisions, including reviewing sex education standards. , \"I take the responsibility very seriously knowing just how many Texas children are depending on the board to do a great job for them,\" Bahorich said in statement late Thursday. \"I look forward to working alongside the governor, legislators, fellow board members, education stakeholders and parents as we dedicate ourselves anew to serving the 5.2 million public school students of Texas.\", Fellow board member Ken Mercer called the appointment an \"excellent choice\" and highlighted her conservative bona fides. , \"Youve got to stand for something and Donna stands for a lot of great things,\" said Mercer, R-San Antonio. \"Shes a rock-solid conservative.\", Barbara Cargill, R-The Woodlands, the boards outgoing chairman, added, \"She is a tireless advocate for our schoolchildren and is well respected by board members, legislators and other stakeholders in education.

The chair steers the focus and moderates discussion during the boards meetings, which usually occur bimonthly in Austin. , Ratliff said he thinks Bahorichs appointment will move the board back toward the fractious infighting of those years. , \"This is not personal.

Noting her long tenure working with the Legislature, she added, \"I feel like Im a pretty quick study and I kind of have a proven track record.\", Mercer, meanwhile, said he was \"very disappointed\" with Ratliffs statements about the new chair. , \"Shes not a registered lobbyist,\" Mercer said, referring to Ratliff, who lobbies for the likes of Microsoft and T-Mobile. \"She understands her job is to do whats best for the children of Texas.\", Bahorich has served on the board since 2013.

Dan Patrick, acting as his campaign manager when he first was elected to the state senate and as his treasurer. , She has also been active in the home schooling movement. In 1998 she helped fund Home Ed Plus, an online nonprofit that offers home schooling parents classwork help and tips to \"provide a Christian environmentin which their student may learn and participate with other students.\", Ratliff said he is concerned she has not experienced the public school environment personally with her own children, and said her history of advocating for charter schools at the state Legislature - and with her former boss are concerning. , Mercer shrugged off his concerns: \"We all have our opinions.

(AP)  Only two months after a difficult budget-balancing session, Louisiana lawmakers Friday got their first official glimpse of the shortfall they already face for next year: $713 million. , News of a horizon filled with future budget gaps wasnt unexpected for the Joint Legislative Committee on the Budget. , The $25 billion budget for the fiscal year that began July 1 contains $542 million in patchwork financing that isnt expected to be available a year later, accounting for much of the projected gap forecast for the 2016-17 budget year. , The shortfall also assumes inflationary increases in health care, retirement and salary costs that lawmakers dont always choose to fund. , Senate Finance Committee Chairman Jack Donahue said use of the piecemeal financing from a tax amnesty program, state surplus and agency reserve accounts helps keep the state from having to make deep cuts to public health care services and colleges. , \"I think using one-time money under those circumstances is the right way to go,\" said Donahue, R-Mandeville. , Though the shortfall projection was steep, legislative leaders noted it was smaller than the $1.6 billion gap they closed this year. Lawmakers were more immediately worried that this years budget will have to be slashed, to account for oil prices falling below state forecast. , Only one month into the budget year, lawmakers Friday already had to trim $4.6 million in planned spending because a package of recently-approved tax and fee bills arent expected to generate all the money used in the budget. Nearly $3.8 million of the cut will fall on public colleges, despite efforts from lawmakers to shield campuses from reductions. , Commissioner of Administration Kristy Nichols, Gov. Bobby Jindals chief budget adviser, said the dollars will be restored if income forecasts improve, rather than drop. , But lawmakers expect they could face more bad news in the coming months. , While oil price declines are good for drivers at the gas pump, large dips in per-barrel price can wreak havoc on Louisianas budget, which gets money from severance taxes and mineral royalties tied to energy production. Every dollar drop in the annual oil price for income projections represents an estimated $11 million hit to the state general fund. , This years budget is built on a nearly $62 per barrel oil price. , \"The price of oil is a whole lot less than that,\" said Sen. Ed Murray, D-New Orleans. \"That puts the budget significantly out of balance.\", Oil prices have recently hovered around the low-$40 range per barrel. Decisions on adjusting oil and gas revenue projections, however, arent expected to be made until economists gather more data. , The states income forecasting panel, the Revenue Estimating Conference, met Friday but didnt rework projections to address oil price changes. , Economists are awaiting more information across the states various tax types to see if income taxes, sales tax or other revenue sources are performing better than expected and can make up the gap for sliding oil prices. , The income forecasting panel instead gathered to adjust the states revenue projections to account for millions of dollars from fee hikes, tax increases and tax break scale-backs approved by lawmakers in the last legislative session to raise money for the state treasury. , Nearly $767 million in new revenue from the tax and fee changes was added to this years forecast. The budget hole forecast for the following year comes even after assuming that $653 million will continue to be generated from those taxes and fees next year.]", "Date": "20150814", "Title": "[Next year's Louisiana budget shortfall projected at $713M]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/business/energy/article/Next-year-s-state-budget-shortfall-projected-at-6444483.php", "Author": "[Melinda Deslatte, Associated Press]"}

My goal will be to stand up to the status quo and fight to make the tough decisions that career politicians wont make.\", Grisham will continue to advocate for more permissive gun laws in Texas and traditional values and against \"federal overreach,\" according to his new campaign website. He also believes in drug tests for welfare recipients, the death penalty, tough-on-crime legislation and bolstering Texas agriculture. , He is opposed to Obamacare and said he \"will support good pay for teachers, appropriate local funding of schools, high standards and less red tape.\", One of the most prominent activists at the Capitol this year, Grisham threw his support behind the push to end Texas 125-year ban on the open carry of handguns. The Legislature did vote to lift the ban, but only for those Texans with concealed handgun licenses. , Grisham, who lost his Texas CHL after a 2013 arrest but continues to carry concealed using another states permit, was not happy with the legislative compromise, advocating for so-called unlicensed, or \"constitutional,\" carry. , But Grisham, a law-and-order Republican, disagreed with the tactics of fellow open carry activist Kory Watkins and his group, who are notorious among police officers in north Texas for shadowing law enforcement during their shifts. , \"Kory is not the face of open carry. He is the ass,\" Grisham told the Chronicle in February. , In March 2013, Grisham was arrested while carrying a rifle on a hike with his son, which is legal under Texas law. A dashcam video showing the two being stopped by a police officer went viral. Grisham was convicted of interfering with official police duties and fined $2,000, which he paid in nickels as a slight to Bell County District Attorney Jim Nichols. , \"I figured if he was going to run me on a bogus charge, he was going to be paid in nickels,\" said Grisham, who has turned around and sued the officer for violating his 2nd and 4th Amendment rights, unlawful arrest, assault and battery and abuse of authority. , In June, Fraser announced he would not be seeking reelection, ending a nearly 30-year stint in the state Legislature. , Multiple other people have announced or also are thinking about a run for the seat, including former San Antonio City Councilman Reed Williams, state Rep. Susan King, R-Abilene and Austin ophthalmologist Dawn Buckingham, according to the Texas Tribune. , Grisham has enlisted Charles Byrn, who ran unsuccessfully for theAbilene Independent School District Board of Trustees in 2012, as his campaign director.]", "Date": "20150812", "Title": "[Open carry activist announces run for state senate]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/texas/article/Open-carry-activist-announces-run-for-Austin-San-6440523.php", "Author": "[By Lauren McGaughy]"}

She  said lawmakers had placed an advisory measure on the ballot once before -  in 1892, backing the direct election of U.S. senators - and said Prop  49 was a legitimate effort to let lawmakers know \"where the voters stand  on theissue.\", The state Supreme Court has removed from the November ballot a measure calling for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United, the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that allowed unlimited corporate spending in federal elections. , The measure, Proposition 49, was placed on the ballot by Democrats who control both houses of the Legislature. If approved by the voters, it would have asked Congress to submit a constitutional amendment to the states that would authorize federal lawmakers to limit campaign spending and would specify that only people, not corporations, have the right of political free speech. , A lawsuit by the conservative Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association argued that Prop. 49 was invalid because it was only an advisory measure that would not change state law. On Monday, five of the six justices signed an order striking the measure from the Nov. 4 ballot and expressing doubt about whether California voters, who have the power to enact state laws, can consider questions that are purely advisory. , Prop. 49s \"validity is uncertain,\" the justices said, and \"substantial harm can occur if an invalid measure is permitted to remain on the ballot.\" They said they couldnt decide the issue by November, but could have it resolved in time for the next statewide elections in 2016. , Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye cast the lone dissenting vote. She said lawmakers had placed an advisory measure on the ballot once before - in 1892, backing the direct election of U.S. senators - and said Prop 49 was a legitimate effort to let lawmakers know \"where the voters stand on the issue.\", But Justice Goodwin Liu, in an opinion endorsing the courts order, said allowing an advisory measure on the ballot \"blurs accountability for legislative choices.\" He noted that the court had removed an initiative from the ballot in 1984 because it merely asked Congress to draft a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget. , In the 2010 Citizens United ruling, a 5-4 majority of the nations high court said federal laws that limit spending by corporations or labor unions on political causes violate freedom of speech. The ruling affected only spending by independent political organizations and preserved limits on contributions to individual candidates. , Earlier this year, the California Legislature passed a resolution calling for a national constitutional convention to draft an amendment that would overturn the ruling. Prop. 49, approved by the same state lawmakers, would ask Congress to adopt such an amendment and submit it to the states. , Jon Coupal, president of the Jarvis organization - named for the sponsor of the Prop. 13 tax cut of 1978 - said Monday that Prop. 49 was a glorified opinion poll that would damage the electoral process. , \"In an era where voter turnout in California is at an all-time low, why would we want to do something that fosters the notion that votes are meaningless?\" he asked. , Derek Cressman, spokesman for the Prop. 49 campaign, countered that the court had \"canceled an election that (was) meant to check and balance the judicial branch,\" which issued the Citizens United ruling. \"Its pretty chilling.\", The case is Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association vs. Bowen, S220289. , Bob Egelko is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

{"Content": "[ Caption, Close, Students from around the country celebrate in front of the Supreme Court in Washington after the justices upheld a key provision of the Affordable Care Act. (Bill OLeary / Washington Post), Dont let the angry press releases fool you. Republicans have plenty to celebrate now that the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a challenge to the Affordable Care Act. Not only will candidates be able to continue using the law as a political whipping-boy for the 2016 election, but the party also wont have to come up with any viable alternative. Perhaps theyll even start calling it SCOTUScare. At least thats what Justice Antonin Scalia recommended in his dissent. , The issue raised by the case, King v. Burwell, wasnt a question of whether the law itself is constitutional - the court settled that question three years ago when it held that the individual mandate to buy insurance was enforceable as a tax. , In this case the court was asked to address whether the law prohibited policyholders who purchased their insurance through federal exchanges from receiving the subsidies that make insurance affordable. In Texas, more than 832,000 people receive these subsidies to help purchase health insurance through the federal exchange. , The problem rests with four words out of a 900-page document, which states that those subsidies are for people who purchased their plans through exchanges \"established by the state.\", On their own, those words seem like a death knell - to use the words of Gov. Greg Abbott - for Obamacare insurance plans in the 34 states that refused to establish their own exchanges, such as Texas. But those four words dont exist in a vacuum, and it isnt the job of the Supreme Court to presume that Congress would write a law that fails to accomplish what it was created to do. Looking at those words in context, as Chief Justice John Roberts did in his majority opinion, it is implausible to think that Congress would write a law that effectively self-destructs. This is the smart decision of a justice who refuses to play politics. , Yet while the court has settled these legal questions, the Obamacare fight continues. Texas Republicans wasted no time in releasing the usual harangues against the healthcare law. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick called the Affordable Care Act \"broken and a burden.\" U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz called it a \"disaster.\", Theres no denying problems with the rollout of Obamacare, but as time passes the laws actual impact is growing clearer. Health care costs are rising slower, the uninsured rate has hit a record low at 12.9 percent and the law itself saves taxpayers $353 billion over 10 years. Hospitals are also in a better financial position because of these new ranks of insured patients, according to Ted Shaw, president of the Texas Hospital Association. Overall, the law helps people take responsibility for their own health insurance. , If there is a disaster, we dont see it. But that hasnt stopped Abbott from calling for a \"President who will repeal Obamacare and enact real healthcare reforms.\", What exactly \"real healthcare reform\" means is a mystery. It isnt as if Obamacare sprung spontaneously from the presidents forehead in 2009. As the Supreme Court documents in the King decision, the United States has a long history of failed health insurance reform, and the Affordable Care Act serves as a national adaptation of the one successful state plan - Massachusetts 2006 health care reform, which was proposed, signed and implemented by then-Gov. Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate for president in 2012. , At this point, fights over Obamacare smack more of politics than policy, and the poorest Texans are getting caught in the crossfire. Texas political leaders have refused to accept $100 billion in federal funds that would expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Those dollars would cover 90 percent of the programs cost and provide health insurance for the 1.4 million Texans who are too poor to receive subsidies on the federal health care exchange. Without insurance, those Texans rely either on charity or county taxpayers to cover their bills. , For the time being, Texans will have to pay twice for public health care, with federal and local taxes, while the people who need help the most get left behind. Expanding Medicaid would help everyone, but were not optimistic. After all, it is hard to send out an angry press release when people are happy.]", "Date": "20150625", "Title": "[Editorial: Obamacare stands]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/editorials/article/Obamacare-stands-6350038.php", "Author": "[Copyright 2015: Houston Chronicle]"}

A large crowd of nearly 300 members, was a traditional caucus-style event, with all of the progressive mayoral candidates present. , Mayoral candidate Sylvester Turner unveiled a plan Thursday to add 540 officers to the Houston Police Department by 2020, an effort he said is necessary to enable officers to better engage the communities they serve and to improve trust between some neighborhoods and police. , Turner said he would pay for the estimated $85 million \"Partners in Safety\" plan by seeking, \"as quickly as I can,\" voter approval to alter the citys decade-old revenue cap to allow more public safety spending. , The cap, which the city hit for the first time last year, limits the revenue Houston can collect from property taxes, its main source of revenue. , The longtime state representatives announcement is the second policing proposal released by a mayoral candidate this week, after Ben Halls call for fully funding HPDs $8 million request for officer body cameras, and for giving the citys citizen oversight board subpoena power. , Turner said he seeks \"community policing,\" a term used by many leaders, including current Police Chief Charles McClelland. Turner did not criticize McClelland or term-limited Mayor Annise Parkers management, but said the citys police officers today are stretched too thin to exit their patrol cars and do the sort of engagement that is needed. , \"In the last several years, the enemy to community policing has been the lack of resources,\" Turner said. \"When you have 5,300 police officers and that number has remained stagnant over the last 10 years, more people coming into the city the citys even more diverse, its very difficult to have effective and adequate community policing.\", Turners proposal also includes fully funding the body camera initiative, the first phase of which will launch this year, along with enhanced cultural and de-escalation training for officers, greater public input and more youth outreach efforts.

And, standing on a stage in front of the giant Boeing 707 that flew as Reagans Air Force One, comparing themselves to their party icon was even harder to resist. , Yet amid that scramble to claim Reagans legacy, the 2016 candidates sometimes obscure the actual record of the man who won two landslide elections a generation ago. , Reagan was a champion of cutting taxes, but he also raised them. He called the Soviet Union \"the evil empire\" but forged a productive relationship with his counterpart in Moscow, Mikhail Gorbachev. He appointed conservative Antonin Scalia to the Supreme Court but also tapped Sandra Day OConnor and Anthony Kennedy  swing votes who protected abortion rights and helped legalize same-sex marriage. , \"The more you knew Ronald Reagan, the less you want to speak for him. Its the people who didnt know him who find it so easy to say exactly what he would do,\" says Sal Russo, a Republican strategist and tea party mastermind who worked as Reagans personal aide during his tenure as California governor in the 1960s and 1970s. , The complexities of Reagans history went on-air this week when a conservative, pro-immigration group called the National Immigration Forum starting running an ad nationally to chide Trump and others for their positions on illegal immigration. , The ad cited Reagans farewell address, in which he described the country as \"shining city ... God-blessed and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace.\", Before taking his place in the Oval Office, Reagan became the face of outsider conservatism when he nearly toppled President Gerald Ford in the 1976 primaries. Russo said its amusing to see Reagan, \"who really rocked the boat\" in 1976, become \"the lodestar even for Republicans who always support the establishment.\", Author Will Bunch said its \"all part of this canonization process\" Republicans have employed for more than two decades to build Reagan into a utopian conservative, while avoiding inconvenient details. , \"What we hear going into 2016 is often the mythical Reagan, not the real Reagan,\" argues the senior writer at the Philadelphia Daily News and the author of a Reagan analysis, \"Tear Down This Myth.\", Take taxes, for example. For much of Reagans tenure, several marginal personal income tax brackets had rates higher than todays top rate of 39.6 percent. The national debt roughly tripled during his two terms. , On foreign policy, several 2016 contenders cite Reagans credo of \"peace through strength\" as they accuse President Barack Obama of capitulating to U.S. enemies. Walker, for example, has urged Obama to cancel the upcoming visit of Chinas president and declares that \"Iran is not a place we should do business.\", Left unmentioned is how Reagan sold arms to Iranians as part of a plan to aid rebel forces in Nicaragua, and Reagans famous summits with Gorbachev. , Russo, even as he, too, criticizes Obama, said Reagans philosophy gets twisted. \"You have too many candidates who talk about strength so we can go out and win wars,\" he said. Reagan \"had a bitter hatred of communism,\" Russo said, but \"was dreadfully fearful ... of ending the world with a nuclear holocaust.\", Whats clear is that todays voters endorse Reagans legacy, however they see it. , In a 2014 Quinnipiac University poll, 35 percent of voters nationally chose Reagan as the best president the United States has had since World War II  well ahead of Bill Clinton (18 percent) and John Kennedy (15 percent). , Among Republicans, Reagan was the runaway favorite, with 66 percent picking him as the top president in recent history. , Thats perhaps why opponents of the GOP White House hopefuls are also sometimes eager to stand the candidates up next to Reagan. , In an online ad posted Wednesday, the super PAC backing Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clintons campaign spliced some of the GOP contenders comments into Reagans famous \"Morning in America\" TV ad from his 1984 campaign. , After the narrator from the original ad says, \"Its morning again in America,\" the ad cuts to Trump at a podium saying, \"Sadly, the American dream is dead.\", ", "Date": "20150916", "Title": "[Reagan a certain star at GOP debate, whoever else does well]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Reagan-a-certain-star-at-GOP-debate-whoever-else-6508741.php", "Author": "[Bill Barrow, Associated Press]"}

Abbott is again vowing to sue the Obama administration for lifting the threat of deportation from millions of immigrants living illegally in the United States. (AP Photo/Austin American-Statesman, Jay Janner), Heading into what could be another consequential week for Barack Obamas immigration policy, Gov. Greg Abbott continued to voice confidence Sunday that Texas would ultimately prevail in its high-profile legal challenge to the presidents executive action. , In two interviews broadcast from the nations capital, the former attorney general reiterated his belief Texas will fight Obamas move all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, where the state \"should win unanimously.\" Abbott also predicted the odds are \"close to zero\" of the Obama administration securing a stay of a federal judges order last week to halt the implementation of the action, which would shield up to 5 million illegal immigrants from deportation. , \"It shows how dangerous this president is to the Constitution. He feels like there are no guardrails to his limits,\" Abbott said during an interview on Fox News, hours before he was due at the White House to have dinner with Obama and other governors. , The federal governments response to the ruling further came into focus Sunday as Jeh Johnson, secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said it would likely appeal the decision Monday. The White House said Friday it expected to seek a stay of the ruling \"by Monday at the latest,\" effectively asking for the program to proceed while the lawsuit plays out. , \"We will appeal and we will seek a stay so that we can go back to implementation of our efforts to build accountability in the non-documented community,\" Johnson said on CNNs \"State of the Union.\", Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said he expects the courts involved to act quickly, potentially providing the Supreme Court the opportunity to rule on the request for a stay by the end of the week. U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen of Brownsville, who issued the temporary injunction that put the action on hold Monday, will probably reject the White Houses arguments for a stay, sending the decision to the federal appeals court in New Orleans, Tobias said. , Abbott was spending the weekend in Washington to attend meetings for the National Governors Association and Republican Governors Association. As part of the NGA activities, Abbott was scheduled to join other governors for a dinner at the White House with Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and second lady Jill Biden. , \"Within this room, were not going to agree on everything, but I am committed to working with each and every one of you over the next two years to keep making progress,\" : Obama told the governors Sunday evening in the State Dining Room, according to a transcript of his remarks provided by the White House. , Abbott, who sued the federal government more than 30 times as attorney general, took note of the \"irony\" of the situation in a tweet sent after the dinner. He attached a photo of rock band Hall & Oates performing at the White House. , Abbotts last lawsuit  the one challenging the executive action  has cemented him as a national political figure in the months following his landslide victory over Democratic opponent Wendy Davis. In an appearance on CBSs \"Face the Nation,\" Abbott flirted with his potential role as a kingmaker in the 2016 presidential race, which could feature as many as five Republicans with ties to Texas. , \"The odds favor that the next president, at least the Republican nominee, is going to have a Texas connection,\" Abbott told host Bob Schieffer before repeatedly declining to say whether he favors any potential candidate. Abbott did, however, lay out his prescription for the GOP nominee: \"Well, what Im looking for is to ensure, for one, that we have a nominee that is committed to what I am most committed to. And that is someone who is going to follow the Constitution and apply the Constitution, second, someone who is going to step up and do what the American people are demanding, and that is to secure our border.\", In December, Abbott was more tight-lipped on the topic, telling the host of another Sunday show  Chuck Todd of NBCs \"Meet the Press\"  that he would be \"staying out of the primary.\"]", "Date": "20150222", "Title": "[Greg Abbott confident as White House prepares response to immigration ruling]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/texas/article/Greg-Abbott-confident-as-White-House-prepares-6095230.php", "Author": "[By Patrick Svitek]"}

Greg Abbotts quality pre-K legislation as \"socialistic\" and \"a threat to parental rights.\", \"We are experimenting at great cost to taxpayers with a program that removes our young children from homes and half-day religious preschools and mothers day out programs to a Godless environment with only evidence showing absolutely NO LONG-TERM BENEFITS beyond the 1st grade,\" the letter, sent to the state Senate on Tuesday, reads. , RELATED:Texas Gov.

House Bill 4 is modeled on those pledges, and promises to funnel $130 million in state money to incentivize high-quality, half-day pre-kindergarten programs for certain children. , The proposed legislation would not expand eligibility - currently the state only funds pre-K for 4-year-olds from low-income, military and non-native English speaking families - but would offer additional funding to programs that meet certain accountability and quality standards. , Abbotts office did not directly address the letter in a statement released later Tuesday. , \"Governor Abbotts pre-k initiative is a conservative antidote to ineffective pre-existing pre-k programs because it adds accountability, implements high-quality education standards, gives parents and teachers the freedom to determine how best to educate their students and helps schools avoid a one-size-fits-all approach,\" said Abbott press secretary Amelia Chasse. \"It will ensure tax dollars are used more effectively and reduce the $1.7 billion in tax dollars spent on remediation education programs.\", While Patrick quickly distanced himself from the letter Tuesday, saying it was \"unsolicited\" and expressed \"the individual viewpoints of Texas citizens,\" House Bill 4 has not yet been approved by the chamber he oversees. , The letter - and any further delay in the Senate hearing Abbotts pre-K bill - is sure to create friction between the states two most powerful elected officials. Last week, Abbott refused to choose sides in the ongoing debate over tax cuts, saying both the House and Senates plans are possible paths. , Patrick, however, has framed himself as Abbotts true ally, issuing statements that often start \"Governor Abbott and I...\" or \"I agree with Governor Abbott...\", ]", "Date": "20150421", "Title": "[Lt.

Jessica Farrar, D-District 148, WASHINGTON  The Senate voted Tuesday to confirm Dallas-based U.S. attorney Sarah Saldaa to head Immigration and Customs Enforcement, making her the first Latina to oversee enforcement of the nations immigration laws.The 55-39 vote reflected the objections of Texas Sens. John Cornyn, Ted Cruz, and other Republicans angered over President Obamas recent executive action delaying deportations of roughly 5 million undocumented immigrants.Obama called Saldaa \"the right person to lead the dedicated men and women at ICE in securing our borders, keeping American communities safe, and upholding our values.\"The Congressional Hispanic Caucus issued a statement praising Saldaa for \"breaking new ground.\"Until the presidents action on immigration last month, Saldaa, the states first Hispanic U.S. attorney, had enjoyed bipartisan support both in Texas and Washington.When she was confirmed in 2011 as the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas, she got the strong backing of both Cornyn and then-Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison.In a floor speech Tuesday, Cornyn called Saldaa \"a person of courage and conviction,\" noting that she had presided over the prosecution of former Dallas Mayor Pro Tem Don Hill for corruption.\"Unfortunately, the president changed everything this last November by his executive order by his executive actions on immigration,\" Cornyn said. \"When confirmed, she will be the principal enforcer of our immigration laws, and unfortunately, she now claims that the president was operating within his legal authority to issue this executive action.\"Under Senate rules, her confirmation required only a simple majority, giving Republicans little hope of blocking her.In the end, Democrats said Saldaa owed her confirmation in part to Cruz. His unsuccessful weekend gambit to block Obamas executive action, they argued, created an opening to vote on a raft of stalled presidential nominations.Cruz disputed that account Tuesday, accusing Democrats of causing the delay by denying his request for a direct vote defunding Obamas executive \"amnesty\" as part of an annual spending bill.Writing in an editorial published Tuesday in Politico, Cruz said Saldaa \"has pledged to uphold Obamas amnesty.\"Cornyn said that while he admires Saldaa, the administration had put her in the \"untenable position\" of either disagreeing with the president or fully embracing his immigration policies.Saldaa will report to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, who praised her commitment to \"supporting those that enforce our laws, protect the homeland, and promote public safety.\"]", "Date": "20141216", "Title": "[Saldaa confirmed to head ICE]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/us/article/Salda-a-confirmed-to-head-ICE-5960933.php", "Author": "[By Kevin Diaz]"}

At that time, he had investments in just two businesses; by 2014, this had expanded to 28. He had said he is trying to divest or dial down many of these investments after critics have raised conflict of interest concerns. , 3 - The number of times Paxton admitted to soliciting clients for his friend Frederick \"Fritz\" Mowery without being properly registered with state authorities. He was fined $1,000 and reprimanded in April 2014. Texans for Public Justice, an Austin-based group, later filed a criminal complaint with Travis County prosecutors, saying the violation amounted to a third-degree felony. , 20 - The percent by which Paxton defeated Sam Houston, his Democratic opponent in the 2014 race for attorney general. Houston, and Paxtons Republican rivals in the GOP primary, lost even after continuing to highlight Paxtons admitted securities violations. , 10 - The number of months between the time when Paxton admitted to breaking the law and Travis County prosecutors referred the case to Collin County, where any violations likely took place. The case was put on hold because of an internal policy aimed at preventing politically motivated investigations in campaign season. , 4 - The number of businesses Paxton and Collin County District Attorney Greg Willis have invested in together. Willis, a long-time friend and political ally of Paxton, recused himself after it became clear months had passed without him taking up the case referred to him by Travis County prosecutors. , 2 -The number of special prosecutors assigned to the case in April after Willis recusal. A month later, a local judge agreed to grant the prosecutors request to expand the case to include any and all possible securities act violations. , $100,000+ - The amount of money involved in evidence the special prosecutors plan to present to a Collin County grand jury this month. Schaffer has said they have \"substantial evidence\" to secure a first-degree felony indictment against Paxton. , $26 million - The total stock sale for Servergy, Inc. , a McKinney-based company over the last five years. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission confirmed it began investigating Servergy in 2013 for allegedly defrauding its investors. Paxton was an early investor in the company, his name and email was found in the SEC subpoena of Servergy principals. , $2.5 million - The amount of money Paxton currently holds in his campaign coffers, a comfortable cushion to mitigate against future expenses. , AUSTIN  Attorney General Ken Paxton is expected to surrender to authorities Monday following an indictment on multiple felony charges stemming from his involvement with a North Texas technology company accused of defrauding investors, according to multiple sources close to the case. , A Collin County grand jury issued the indictment against the first-term attorney general on Tuesday, two sources who had been briefed on the proceedings told the Chronicle on Saturday. , Paxton faces two counts of first-degree securities fraud and one count of third-degree securities fraud, with the most serious charges carrying a minimum sentence of five years in prison, special prosecutor Kent Schaffer told The New York Times. , Schaffer said Paxton is accused of encouraging people, including current and former members of the Legislature, to invest more than $600,000 in a McKinney-based technology company called Servergy without telling them he was making a commission. He also misrepresented himself as an investor in the company that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating for defrauding stockholders as recently as December 2014. The first-degree charges each carry a sentence of five to 99 years in prison and a fine of not more than $10,000. , The third-degree charge stems from his failure to properly register with the state as an investment adviser representative, which carries a sentence of two to 10 years in prison, as well as a $10,000 fine. , The indictment was immediately sealed Tuesday, but will be unsealed Monday afternoon, according to a high-ranking source with the Texas Department of Public Safety who asked not to be identified. Local media reported a Tarrant County judge already has been named to preside over the case, which is expected to go to trial. , Paxtons spokesman on Saturday did not answer multiple calls, texts and emails requesting comment. The charges involve actions Paxton is accused of taking before he was elected attorney general last fall. , Calls for Paxtons resignation surfaced almost immediately after the indictment news broke Saturday afternoon. Craig McDonald, executive director of the Austin-based advocacy group Texans for Public Justice, said the only appropriate response would be for Paxton to step aside. , \"How can you have faith in the Texas legal system if its top official remains in office while under indictment for felony securities fraud? That shouldnt be able to happen,\" said McDonald, whose group filed an early criminal complaint against Paxton. , Calls and emails to the Texas Republican Party and office of Gov. Greg Abbott were not returned.Paxton was not without supporters, however, with fellow tea party favorite Rep. Matt Schaefer, R-Tyler, likening the indictment to that of former Gov. Rick Perry. Perry, now seeking the Republic nomination for president, has repeatedly called his own indictment a partisan attack. Tony McDonald, counsel for the conservative advocacy group Empower Texans, called the indictments \"politically charged attacks\" in a post on the groups website. , State law does not require Paxton to step down due to the indictment. Like Perry, who was indicted during his final months in office, Paxton could retain his job as the legal process continues. , Jim Henson, head of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin, said a number of factors will influence if and how Paxton leaves the position. , \"Its going to be a little harder to sustain the argument that this was a politically motivated persecution over time,\" Henson said. \"But my suspicion is that we will not see the attorney general going particularly quietly into the night.\", The Chronicle could not reach Schaffer Saturday, and co-special prosecutor Brian Wice declined comment on the indictment reports. , \"As defense attorneys, we have dedicated our careers to ensuring that every citizen accused of any crime is afforded the fundamental constitutional guarantees of the presumption of innocence, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and a fair trial with a reliable result,\" Wice said in a statement. \"Because our statutory mandate as special prosecutors is not to convict, but to see that justice is done, our commitment to these bedrock principles remains inviolate.\", Paxtons criminal case dates to April 2014, when the then-state senator admitted to soliciting clients for his friend Frederick \"Fritz\" Mowerys investment firm without being properly registered with the state as an investment adviser representative. , That occurred at least three times during his dozen years in the state House and Senate, Paxton admitted. He was fined $1,000 and officially reprimanded solely for the final instance because the statute of limitations had expired for the first two cases. , Soon after, Texans for Public Justice filed a criminal complaint against Paxton with Travis County prosecutors. The case was put on hold until after the 2014 election, when Paxton sailed to an easy win in the race for attorney general. In January, Travis County prosecutors kicked the case to, Paxtons home county in North Texas, where they said the offenses likely took place. , Months later, Collin County District Attorney Greg Willis recused himself, citing his close personal and business relationship with Paxton, and referred it to the Texas Rangers. It was only then that the investigation was broadened into any and all possible securities act violations, after the Texas Rangers uncovered evidence of wrongdoing in addition that to which Paxton admitted in April 2014. , Paxton became involved with Servergy soon after Bill Mapp, a Paxton donor and tea party member in McKinney, took over at its helm. Paxton still holds at least 10,000 shares of Servergy stock, according to financial documents covering last year, and also used to name the company on his \"business entities\" list. , The SEC began investigating the McKinney-based company in 2013, saying it allegedly defrauded its stockholders by misrepresenting orders it had received for the Cleantech-1000, a server it said would consume up to 80 percent less power and space compared to others on the market. , The SEC took Servergy to court in 2014 to force its leaders to produce documents responsive to multiple subpoenas. That case was eventually settled when Servergy produced the information requested. , Rep. Byron Cook, R-Corsicana and former state Rep. Bob Griggs, both Servergy investors, also sued the company in 2014 for similar documents. That case also was settled, and Cook, who heads the House State Affairs Committee, remains an investor. Terry Jacobson, a Corsicana attorney who counts Cook and Griggs among his clients, declined to comment Saturday on the indictment. , Mapp no longer heads the company but remains an investor, said Miranda Sevcik, spokesperson for current Servergy CEO Lance Smith. While it did take the company longer than expected, she said, it eventually produced the server to the specifications promised investors. , \"They are currently using it to provide tech solutions in a cloud that secures and stores data,\" Sevcik said. \"They are generating revenue on this and creating value for their shareholders.\", Paxton is the first sitting attorney general to be indicted in more than 30 years. In 1983, a Travis County grand jury indicted then-Attorney General Jim Mattox, a Democrat, for commercial bribery. Mattox defeated the indictment and was re-elected to the post in 1986. , Staff writer Mike Ward and Jim Pinkerton contributed to this report, which contains material from The New York Times.]", "Date": "20150801", "Title": "[Sources: Attorney General Ken Paxton indicted]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/us/article/Attorney-General-Ken-Paxton-indicted-local-media-6419389.php", "Author": "[By Lauren McGaughy]"}

Trey Martinez Fischer, D-San Antonio, who tried to kill Senate Bill 11 through a series of legislative maneauvers. \"This is a super-priority of the leadership. You never know when the stakes are this high whether you can kill a bill.\", The bill would allow concealed carry licensees to tote their handguns in most college buildings and dorms. Currently, they are only allowed in public spaces, like quads. , With a midnight deadline to pass Senate bills looming, the House approved the legislation by a vote of 101-47. The vote was triggered when lawmakers, who had filed more than 100 amendments to the bill, agreed to pull them down after the bill was amended to a point amenable to both Democrats and Republicans. , The legislation the House approved late Tuesday was a far cry from the original sponsored by Sen. Brian Birdwell, R-Granbury. , Lawmakers filed more than 100 amendments to the bill, most with the intention of delaying debate or rendering the legislation impotent. The House adopted just a handful of these changes before taking a vote, but in doing so dramatically changed the nature and scope of the legislation. , Two amendments adopted by the House are signficant: one would require private universities in Texas to also implement the legislation - the Senate version required only public institutions to do so - and the second would allow each campus to decide where concealed handguns would be allowed. , The bill must now be approved once more by a majority of House members to be considered finally passed. It would then head back to the Senate, which is not expected to agree with the changes made to its legislation. Differences would be ironed out in a conference committee, where opponents of the legislation expect there could be deadlock. , If a majority of the conference committee members from both chambers cannot come to an agreement on the bill, it will not become law. Both Birdwell nor Straus denied further comment on the vote Tuesday. , Martinez Fischer said he still believes there was still a good chance to defeat the legislation. , \"This is not over til its over. The notion that we could take an entire day and fight campus carry until 11:35, 11:40 at night, its a significant accomplishment, to know there are negotiated changes to make this proposition much more difficult to become a legislative reality,\" he said. , The campus carry legislation is one of just several bills filed this session to expand the rights of gun owners in Texas. Both chambers have passed legislation to allow licensed open carry of handguns, but that would not extend to college campuses. , Proponents of the campus carry bill, including House sponsor Allen Fletcher, R-Tomball, said it is necessary to ensure college students have the right to defend themselves at all times. They have argued the proposal would not result in many additional guns on campuses, since current lawrequired licensees be 21 or older as well as pass a background check and written and range test. , \"The idea that this bill will increase is any increase in violence is unfounded,\" Fletcher said during debate Tuesday night. \"We should not unarm them or disarm them.\", Many of Texas higher education officials, including University of Texas System Chancellor William McRaven, disagree. The retired admiral and former head of U.S. Special Operations Command has called the legislation unnecessary and potentially costly, and has said it could hurt institutions ability to recruit and retain top faculty. , \"The presence of handguns on Texas campuses, where we would be one of fewer than 10 states to allow this conduct, may well cause faculty to be discouraged from relocating from other states,\" McRaven wrote in an April letter to House lawmakers. \"The intuitive answer is that the presence of concealed weapons will make us less competitive.\", If ultimately approved in the conference committee, the bill will head to the desk of Gov. Greg Abbott, who has promised to sign legislation that furthers gun rights in Texas. , The legislation is one of just several bills filed this session to expand the rights of gun owners in Texas. Both chambers have approved House Bill 910, which would allow anyone with a concealed carry license to openly display their handgun in a hip or shoulder holster. Texas law already allows the open carry of long arms like rifles without any such licensing requirements, but open carry of handguns has been banned here for more than 125 years.]", "Date": "20150527", "Title": "[Texas House passes watered-down campus carry bill]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/House-passes-campus-carry-6288148.php", "Author": "[By Lauren McGaughy]"}

All seven candidates shared at least some level of concern about issues such as gentrification and low voter turnout.The one question to generate any fireworks was a predictable one: Whether the candidates support keeping and funding the defined benefit pension plan for municipal workers. , First, some background on Houstons pension problem. Prior to benefit increases in the early 2000s, the citys annual contribution required to keep its three pensions fully funded had not topped 19 percent of payroll for police, 16 percent for firefighters or 10 percent for municipal workers for at least a decade. Those contribution levels now top 30 percent of payroll for police and fire and 25 percent for the municipal plan. , The city has met the recommended payment to the police or municipal pensions only once since 2002, and keeping up will only get harder: Payments are projected to increase roughly 50 percent by 2019, to $440 million. This year, that payment tops $350 million, almost twice what the city spends on trash pickup, parks and libraries combined. , Reforms to the police pension in 2004 and the municipal plan in 2007 mean retirement packages for new firefighters are by far the citys most generous, so the fire plan is most often discussed.Former Kemah mayor Bill King and former city attorney Ben Hall are the most hawkish on the subject. , King said he opposes all defined benefit plans (as opposed to defined contribution, similar to many workers 401(k)s). , \"We know in the public sector defined benefit plans create the temptation for elected officials to promise a benefit for workers on one hand and not ask the taxpayers to fund them on the other hand,\" he said. \"These plans will never be funded.\", Hall said he would honor all past promises to workers but would reform pensions for new hires, tying them to market risk rather than guaranteed specified benefits. , City Councilman Steve Costello and former Harris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia struck a more moderate tone, with both saying defined benefit plans can be sustainable but calling for \"local control,\" or the ability for the city make pension decisions without going to the Legislature, which is the current situation. , Former Congressman Chris Bell said he, too, supports defined benefit plans but acknowledged reform is needed. , \"Is it sustainable as it presently is with the firefighters? No, and were going to have to address it,\" he said. \"But its also disingenuous to sit up here and try to lead people to believe that as mayor youre going to be able to cram a solution down the throats of the firefighters. You cant. Youre going to have to negotiate, and I will.\", Businessman Marty McVey and State Rep. Sylvester Turner positioned themselves as most cautious on pension reform. McVey said the city should issue debt to cover its multibillion-dollar pension underfunding and move on; \"We need to own up to our promise,\" he said. , Hall, King and Costello all took swipes at Turner on pensions, prompting Bell to draw a sustained laugh from the crowd when he quipped, \"Dont worry Sylvester, Ill protect you.\", Turner, when his turn came, touted his work to place the state pension system on firmer footing, and said talk of \"local control\" is misleading because it suggests the Legislature has imposed more generous pension benefits on the city when every change since 1993 has been done with the mutual support of city and pension leaders. , \"What is missing in this conversation is not just the benefits for the employees but governments like the city of Houston have consistently underfunded their contributions, have not made their payments, and now want to blame the employees,\" Turner said. \"You cannot balance the citys books on the backs of labor, and I think we need to be very careful when we address this issue.\", The events panelists (Richard Shaw of the Harris County AFL-CIO, Melissa Miranda of Mi Familia Vota, Tarsha Jackson of Texas Organizing Project, Hamilton Gramajo of Fe y Justicia Worker Center and Paul Puente of Houston Gulf Coast Building and Construction Trades Council) and moderator (Univisions Rebecca Suarez) didnt call a forum on pensions, however, and most questions focused in other areas. , Here are some highlights of what the candidates said about economic inequality, workers rights and affordable housing:, - Bell said at least twice that he would put a labor liaison on his executive staff as mayor and also stressed the need to address growing economic inequality in Houston. \"If we dont address this issue were going to continue to have a city of haves versus have-nots,\" he said. , - Costello focused several times on worker training. He advocated the use of \"best value\" rather than \"low bid\" selections in city contracting to enable the city to better penalize irresponsible companies that cut corners. On affordable housing, he advocated for the city to provide more incentives to developers to avoid gentrification, and for similar efforts creating an affordable district for artists. , - Garcia: Touted his efforts while on City Council to get vaccines to Latino kids in his district when he learned his district had one of the citys lowest immunization rates. He focused heavily on affordable housing and gentrification, and said the city must find ways to prevent citizens from paying for their neighbors investments in their own taxes. , - Hall said he would give preference in city contracting to companies that provide apprenticeships and said he would pursue policies to \"grandfather\" existing homes in gentrifying areas to prevent residents from being pushed out. , - King: Said he would work to increase the number of and funding for Federally Quality Health Clinics, and would evaluate whether city clinics unnecessarily duplicate services with county clinics. He said any contractor caught stealing workers wages should be fired and banned from doing business with the city. , - McVey said because the Legislature has blocked the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, the city should seek a way to get payments directly from Washington. McVey also called for more urban planning, with a focus on preventing gentrification. , - Turner touted his support in the Legislature for expanding a health insurance program for impoverished youth and for increased funding for trauma centers, and took issue with an expansive subsidy program launched under Parker to pay developers $15,000 per apartment or condominium built downtown; \"Its about time we pushed that to the neighborhoods,\" he said.]", "Date": "20150612", "Title": "[Pensions provide rare fireworks at third mayoral forum]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/politics/election/local/article/Pensions-provide-rare-fireworks-at-third-mayoral-6312573.php", "Author": "[By Mike Morris]"}

A grand jury last week indicted Paxton on felony securities fraud charges. (AP Photo/Collin County via AP), AUSTIN - Ken Paxtons first-degree felony indictments were dismissed and then re-issued Tuesday so prosecutors could clarify the accusations against the first-term attorney general. , A Collin County grand jury indicted Paxton last month on two first-degree felonies and one third-degree felony for allegedly violating state securities laws. , The original indictments accuse Paxton of engaging in fraud \"in connection with the offer for sale and sale\" of at least $100,000 worth of stock in McKinney-based tech company Servergy to Byron Cook,a Corsicana Republican who chairs the House State Affairs Committee, and Joel Hochberg, a south Florida businessman. , They also alleged Paxton failed to disclose to Cook and Hochberg that the state legislator had not personally invested in Servergy and had received 100,000 shares of stock from the company as compensation. , The re-indictmentsmake the same claims but clarify the accusations, alleging that Paxton \"unlawfully and intentionally\" offered to sell at least $100,000 worth of Servergy stock to both men whilefailing to disclose, also intentionally, that he \"had not, and was not\" investing his own funds. , The re-indictments also clarifies that Paxton allegedly received the free shares in exchange for selling the stock. , Read the Cook re-indictment document here. , Read the Hochberg re-indictment document here. , The two first-degree felony charges carry a sentence of five to 99 years in prison, and a fine of no more than $10,000. , The third-degree charge stems from Paxtons failure to properly register with the state as an investment adviser representative, which carries a sentence of two to 10 years in prison, as well as a $10,000 fine. , The complainants in this indictment were named as James and Freddie Henry, clients of Paxton friend and business associate Frederick \"Fritz\" Mowery. In the indictments, the Henrys allege Paxton acted as an investment advisor representative without being properly registered with the Texas State Securities Board. , In April 2014, Paxton admitted to repeatedly soliciting clients for Mowery without being registered. He paid and $1,000 fine and was reprimanded by the securities board. The board ismulling whether to revoke Mowerys state registration for other alleged instances of fraud and deceit. , Paxtons attorney on Tuesday used the Tuesday re-indictment to criticize the work of special prosecutors Brian Wice and Kent Schaffer, two Houston-based criminal defense attorneys assigned to the case after Collin County District Attorney Greg Willis recused himself because of his personal and business ties to Paxton. , \"This confirms that there have been troubling issues with the grand jury process from the beginning,\" said Paxton attorney Joe Kendall. \"They had months to investigate and then rushed to indict.  Now, the special prosecutors are back to clean up the botched indictments.  It should make every fair-minded person question the process in this case.\", Wice and Schaffer shot back later Tuesday, telling the Chronicle, \"Contrary to the assertion of Mr. Paxtons criminal defense lawyer that the indictments charging his client with two counts of first-degree felony securities fraud were botched, we obtained re-indictments to defuse the boilerplate arguments predictably advanced by the defense that the original indictments lacked specificity or were otherwise ambiguous.\", \"It is not unusual in any felony case, particularly fraud cases, for prosecutors to ask the grand jury to re-indict so as to provide sufficient notice to the accused as to the nature of the criminal conduct he must defend against,\" they added. \"At the end of the day, the fair-minded people whom Mr. Paxtons criminal lawyer believes should question the process in this case will recognize that the serious allegations against his client remain unchanged.\", Paxtons third-degree indictment was handed up on July 7, just days before the statute of limitations would have run out.

The longtime lawmakers legal troubles have been public knowledge for some time. During the 2014 election season, political watchers routinely warned voters about Paxtons record of insider dealings and kickbacks. As we wrote during the primary runoff: \"Voters shouldnt want a lawyer-in-chief who will confront the wrong end of a grand jury on day one.\", It took a bit longer than one day, but here we are at the predictable inevitability of a broken political system. , Paxtons campaign for attorney general was a parade of red flags. News poured from the woodwork about admissions to lawbreaking, failures to fill out ethics disclosures, lawsuits about breach of fiduciary duty and instances of him investing with companies that suspiciously went on to land state contracts. There was even the odd story about him stealing another lawyers $1,000 pen. , This should have been enough to doom a man in a competitive primary race, but serious allegations seemed to matter less than an endorsement from now-U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz. , It didnt have to be like this. Republican primary voters had a fine candidate in Paxtons opponent, former state Rep. Dan Branch of Dallas. A seasoned conservative, Branch could tout the endorsements of many legal advisers to then-Attorney General Greg Abbott and support from former President George W. Bush. While in the Legislature, Branch proved capable and pragmatic. \"Conservatives have a responsibility to govern,\" he told the Chronicle editorial board during his endorsement meeting. , Unfortunately, Republican primary voters saw little to like in Branchs camaraderie with Texas Speaker of the House Joe Straus, a moderate Republican and tea party target. Democratic candidate Sam Houston didnt fare much better in the general election. , Now were stuck with an attorney general who will be too busy tending to self-inflicted wounds to fulfill the business of his office. Government transparency, consumer protection and all manner of regular governing will have to take a back seat to Paxtons personal legal woes. , This unforced error should remind Texans that they have a duty to vote in primaries not on the basis of their political allegiance, but with a strategic mindset aimed at blocking the worst that our state has to offer. Until Republican primary voters love Texas more than they hate Straus, well be stuck with politicians who have more ambition than ethics. ]", "Date": "20150804", "Title": "[There was no surprise in Ken Paxton indictment]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/editorials/article/There-was-no-surprise-in-Ken-Paxton-indictment-6422565.php", "Author": "[Copyright 2015: Houston Chronicle]"}

The proposal would bypass a second taxpayer vote on the fate of the Astrodome. The voters rejected the first proposal, expecting a plan to demolish the structure would be presented, but Emmett refused to honor the taxpayers decision. , Its not mentioned which government(s) would agree to issue the tax credits. Further, were told the plan would \"not involve taxpayer money.\" This inference is misleading. Obviously, the issuance of a tax credit by any government reduces the amount of their tax collections and creates the exact same result as collecting the taxes and spending them on the project. Either way, the government(s) and taxpayers have less money to spend for other uses. , Regarding the bond proposal on the Nov. 2015 election ballot, to pay the bond principal and interest taxes will necessarily have to increase, but it may not require a tax \"rate\" increase to repay the debt because of increasing property values. This is common sense. As with Emmetts Dome plan, there really is no free lunch. , Don Sumners, Houston, , Mass transit, Regarding \"Metros new fast line off to a slow start\" (Page A1, July 11), critics are correct in saying, after spending $1.4 billion, the Green and Purple lines were unnecessary and expensive replacement of buses. Metro should have its highest priority moving large numbers of passengers between population and work and recreation centers, not to replace or augment bus service for \"underserved\" neighborhoods. , Determining the population and work centers is not rocket science. Think airports, sports venues, downtown, Galleria, Greenway Plaza, the universities, etc. Anywhere there are HOV lanes indicate rail is needed. Overloaded freeways and absence of parking beg for rail options, which will get people out of cars and off freeways. , Houston and Harris County need real mass transit options. HOV lanes should be converted to rail with buses feeding passengers to and from ADA-compliant Park & Ride or transit centers. , Nelson Harbison, Houston, , Bad, bad deal, Regarding \"Diplomacy wins\" (Page B6, Wednesday), the Chronicle editorial board must have a different view of the \"nuclear deal\" than many of the ranking members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, since there is a widespread campaign to not approve the \"deal.\" And though none of us may want another Mideast war, what will Secretary of State John Kerry think should the Iranians not let the inspectors near the places of interest?, The editorial states; \"If the U.S. has learned anything, it is that the Mideast is not a place for its military to enter lightly.\" Yes, and it is not the place where once an advantage has been won militarily, that you cut and run like President Obama did and tell the enemy when you are leaving!, Lawrence Keen, Pearland]", "Date": "20150803", "Title": "[Monday letters: Astrodome, Metro rail, Iran]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/letters/article/Monday-letters-Astrodome-Metro-rail-Iran-6418460.php", "Author": "[Copyright 2015: Houston Chronicle]"}

Balmer even states Edward Kennedy was the frontrunner. ,  Although it may be \"exceptional  in American political rhetoric to hear a presidential aspirant take on powerful interests,\" I believe the American people just may be ready to look past the onslaught of messages by the special interest money \"that have flooded the political arena\" and nominate and even elect a person who pursues \"peace, justice and care for those on the margins, those who lack the resources to command the attention of politicians.\" At least I hope they can. , Bill Spear Bartlett, Houston, , Classical collapse, Regarding \"Classical music station to go digital\" (Page B2, Saturday), there is a saying: If it aint broke, dont fix it. , I knew it was only a matter of time before classical music became ever less accessible as soon as the public radio news and music formats were split. , At the same time, 88.7 became padded with repetition and far more news than any one person needs to hear in one day.  The 91.7 frequency is much weaker than 88.7 and already has severely curtailed the reach of classical music.  , Switching to HD and streaming will further limit the accessibility of classical music to all.  Once the ordinary car and home radios cannot access it, it is cut off for those who have older equipment or cannot afford newer equipment or subscriptions. , The solution is not to further marginalize classical radio but to reincorporate it into the 88.7 frequency with its strength and broad listener base. , I was a faithful donor to public radio before the station split but fell off the wagon once I saw the decision to limit the reach of classical music in Houston.  I will return when that is corrected. , Deborah Moran, Houston, , Paying tolls, Regarding \"Norths growth calls for Hardy upgrades\" (Page A1, Tuesday), Im not sure why Houstons in-town residents are barking about toll roads. ,  If you live and work inside the Loop, then you seldom have to use the toll roads and really arent paying tolls. Commuters driving from the suburbs are paying. , I am probably in the minority of not being annoyed by toll roads. Im not saying build more of them, but toll roads do get built faster and better. , The new Katy Freeway is nice and wide (yet still congested) because there are toll lanes on it that help pay for it. , Interstate 45 has been under a state of construction for decades because it was kept free.

{"Content": "[ Caption, Close, Traffic crosses the Spring Creek bridge on Kuykendahl Road between Montgomery and Harris counties. , Montgomery County officials must now decide whether to retool a controversial road bond measure that voters in The Woodlands rallied against in record numbers Saturday after raising concerns that construction would increase traffic in their affluent suburb, among other issues. , The $350-million bond measure to improve and expand roadways served as a lightning rod in and around The Woodlands, where residents opposed an extension of the Woodlands Parkway west to State Route 249 that was planned to as an east-west corridor in the growing county. After its failure, how and when the county will address several traffic and infrastructure concerns remain open questions. , \"Traffic in The Woodlands has become so heavy that the quality of life is beginning to be negatively affected,\" said Jon Bauman, vice president of the Texas Patriots PAC, an influential tea party group based in The Woodlands that organized against the bond measure. \"Most people feel like one more car is too many.\", The referendums rejection slows the countys ability to tackle road projects critical to alleviating traffic in the area, which is largely believed to be the number one problem facing Montgomery County residents. , Other projects in the measure included $60 million for the widening of Rayford Road east of I-45, $23.5 million for widening State Route 105 east through Cut and Shoot and a $10 million for work on a Magnolia bypass. Bauman and other opponents of the bond have called on the county to hold another election in November. , \"It is time for us to demand a better bond package for November,\" said Gordy Bunch, a director of The Woodlands township who was against the bond referendum, in a statement Sunday. \"A road bond without extending Woodlands Parkway, no maintenance projects, and one that addresses our near-term, immediate needs.\", Rice political science professor Bob Stein said there wasnt a clear direction for the county going forward. He said it should do an analysis of the voting results precinct-by-precinct to see where opposition was greatest on election day. Stein said a November election could bring out more voters in general - maybe beyond just The Woodlands. , But the biggest school district in Montgomery County, the Conroe Independent School District, is planning a bond referendum for November, and Bruce Tough, who chairs The Woodlands Township, said voters in The Woodlands and elsewhere in the county might be reluctant to vote in favor of multiple measures. , Tough supported the bond this time around. \"In hindsight and probably in foresight, I would have deferred The Woodlands parkway expansion,\" he said. \"Youre jeopardizing a $350-million bond thats affecting all of the county.\", While many thought the election would be close, the road bonds defeat Saturday was handy, with nearly 60 percent of voters rejecting the measure. Most of the damage was done in early voting when more than 16,000 voters turned out - almost 60 percent of all the votes cast - with nearly 7,500 of those coming from The Woodlands. , Montgomery County hasnt approved a road bond in about a decade, despite the countys population having mushroomed. The last attempt to pass a $200-million road bond package three years ago was rejected by voters. , And the countys population of around a half-million is projected to increase in five years by 108,000 - the equivalent of adding a community the size of The Woodlands - and then double to more than 1 million residents by 2035. , \"Theyre very, very important, very critical to the countys mobility,\" said former county judge Alan Sadler of the road bonds projects. \"And I dont think anyone on either side would disagree with that.\", Montgomery County Commissioners voted to put this years referendum on the ballot in February, and bond supporters were confident that they would be successful. But opposition began building as bond opponents called in inclusion of the parkway extension a \"poison pill\" that would bring thousands of drivers through The Woodlands each day. Proponents said traffic pressures would increase irregardless of the parkways extension. , Opposition was also fortified as opponents questioned some $70 million in funding for what they called \"road maintenance,\" projects they said should be funded by the countys general fund and not bonds. , Stein, who followed the election, said the referendums defeat likely occurred because turnout in The Woodlands - those who felt they would be most affected by the parkway extension - was relatively high and proponents did not wage a robust enough campaign. , \"You had this collective good for everybody, and a very concentrated bad at least in the minds of some people,\" Stein said. , , ]", "Date": "20150510", "Title": "[Montgomery County heads back to the drawing board on road bond]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Montgomery-County-heads-back-to-the-drawing-board-6254672.php", "Author": "[By Mihir Zaveri]"}

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and his Cuban counterpart Bruno Rodriguez said their nations would continue to disagree over issues such as democracy and human rights. But they also said they hoped to make progress on issues ranging from maritime security and public health to the billions of dollars in dueling claims over confiscation of U.S. property and the U.S. economic embargo on the island. , HAVANA (AP)  Jubilant crowds waved American flags and chanted \"Long live the United States!\" as the Stars and Stripes rose over the newly reopened U.S. Embassy in Cuba on Friday after a half-century of often-hostile relations. Secretary of State John Kerry celebrated the day but also made an extraordinary, nationally broadcast call for democratic change on the island. , Hundreds of Cubans mixed with American tourists outside the former U.S. Interests Section, newly emblazoned with the letters \"Embassy of the United States of America.\" They cheered as Kerry spoke, the United States Army Brass Quintet played \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and U.S. Marines raised the flag alongside the building overlooking the famous Malecon seaside promenade. , Meeting more than 54 years after the severing of diplomatic relations, Kerry and Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez set an early September date for the start of talks on full normalization of a relationship so long frozen in enmity. , Not all the talk was as warm as the sunny summer day. Kerry and Rodriguez said their nations would continue to disagree over issues such as democracy and human rights. But they also said they hoped to make progress on issues ranging from maritime security and public health to the billions of dollars in dueling claims over confiscation of U.S. property and the U.S. economic embargo on the island. , It seemed that virtually all of Cuba was glued to television or listening by cellphone as Kerry directly addressed the islands people on political reform. Thats a subject that has remained off-limits in Cuba even as the single-party government has implemented a series of economic reforms and re-established diplomatic ties with the U.S. , \"We remain convinced the people of Cuba would be best served by a genuine democracy, where people are free to choose their leaders, express their ideas, practice their faith,\" Kerry said. He spoke before an audience of Cuban and U.S. diplomats on the embassy grounds and hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of islanders watching and listening live. , Addressing reporters with Kerry after the ceremony, Rodriguez responded by indignantly opening his remarks with complaints of U.S. human rights transgressions  from police shootings of black men to mistreatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, the U.S. naval base that Cuba says must be returned. , \"Cuba isnt a place where theres racial discrimination, police brutality or deaths resulting from those problems,\" Rodriguez said. \"The territory where torture occurs and people are held in legal limbo isnt under Cuban jurisdiction.\", Many Cubans disagree with that assessment, including Afro-Cubans who say discrimination is still rampant despite the revolutions egalitarian ideals, and human rights groups who say regular, short-term arrests of government opponents aim to intimidate dissent and include beatings. , In New York, Republican presidential contender Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American senator from Florida, said he would reverse the Obama administrations new Cuba policy on his first day in office, arguing it gives the Castro government international legitimacy and more resources to repress its people. , Kerry acknowledged that the Obama administration would have a difficult fight in Congress to end the U.S. trade embargo of Cuba so that normal business ties between the two countries could resume. , \"There is no way Congress will lift the embargo if we are not making progress on issues of conscience,\" Kerry said. , President Barack Obama also called for change in Cuba when he announced the new U.S. policy of engagement in December, but his words were less pointed than Kerrys in Havana. , Cuba formally reopened its Washington embassy last month. The U.S. raised its flag in Havana then, too, though saving the formal ceremony for Kerrys visit. Three Marines who took part in the flag-lowering in 1961 handed over the new flag to Marines who raised it on Friday. , Kerry was the first secretary of state to visit since 1945, and his speech was remarkable for its bluntness and the national spotlight in which it came. , Many Cubans lauded Kerrys call for reform, including greater access to technology on an island with one of the worlds lowest rates of internet penetration. They paired their praise with calls for the United States to lift the 53-year-old trade embargo and allow easier travel between the two countries. , \"More democracy, elections, we hope for that to come with this diplomatic opening,\" said Julio Garcia, a 51-year-old mechanic. , Self-employed graphic designers Danay Lopez, 28, and her husband Yosvel Martinez, 32, watched the ceremony with their 3-year-old son, singing both countries national anthems and shouting \"Long live Cuba!\" and \"Long live the United States!\" as the event drew to a close. , \"Kerry spoke about democracy, freedom, Wi-Fi, and hes right,\" Lopez said. \"We want all that to be freed up, but (also) for the U.S. to free up travel, and I dont want my son to live under the embargo.\", Like Obama, Kerry said a longtime U.S. strategy of trying to isolate Cuba and provoke regime change by choking off trade and fomenting grass-roots agitation had failed. , \"It would be equally unrealistic to expect normalizing relations to have a transformative impact in the short term,\" he said. \"After all, Cubas future is for Cubans to shape.\", After speaking to reporters with Rodriguez, Kerry briefly walked Old Havanas historic Plaza de San Francisco with Havana City Historian Eusebio Leal, stopping to look in shops and greet local residents and store owners before heading to an afternoon flag-raising at the home of the embassys chief of mission. , He addressed a group of diplomats, Cuban-Americans and advocates of diplomacy with Cuba before a trio of Marines raised the Stars and Stripes in the stately homes back garden. The event was attended by dissidents including Jose Daniel Ferrer, Miriam Leiva and Yoani Sanchez, who tweeted a selfie with Kerry and a photo of the secretary of state meeting privately with a group of dissidents. , The dissidents were not invited to the embassy ceremony, avoiding tensions with Cuban officials who typically boycott events attended by the countrys small political opposition. , Soon after Kerry was heading home Friday evening, diplomats who negotiated the July 20 embassy reopening will launch full-time into discussing how to bring about measures such as re-establishing direct flights and mail service. , ", "Date": "20150817", "Title": "[Kerry calls for democracy as US flag is raised in Cuba]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Top-US-diplomat-flies-to-Cuba-for-new-policy-6443806.php", "Author": "[Bradley Klapper and Michael Weissenstein, Associated Press]"}

He said the camp was identified as operated by ISIS because \"thats how [the sources] described it to us.\", The FBI, Texas Department of Public Safety and Customs and Border Protection all said they had no information to corroborate the report. Judicial Watch alleged they were lying, and published an article claiming the FBI was meeting Mexican authorities to formulate a strategy to conceal the ISIS camps from the media, again citing unnamed sources. , \"Brat mentioned the issue in that one interview, but after hearing that the reports are being disputed, he is waiting for further confirmation from U.S. officials,\" Gottstein said. , Unfounded rumors of ISIS in Texas have been making media rounds since the brutal militants stormed into international attention last summer. In August 2014, then-Governor Rick Perry warned that ISIS militants may have slipped over the Texas border. In September, U.S. Rep.

Wears a good luck charmIn an interview with the Dallas Morning News, Cruz said during his time as solicitor general, he would wear the same pair of black ostrich boots during oral arguments. , Every American schoolchild learns in government class that any citizen can run for president so long as they are 35 years old and were born in this country. But black-and-white easily can become gray when a child of American citizens happens to be born outside the country. Are they natural born? Such is the case with U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, who was born in Canada. His mother was an American citizen from Delaware; his father, a Cuban, was not. , Q: What does the Constitution say about who is eligible to run for president?, A: The language of Article II Section 1 seems pretty clear: \"No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.\", Q: So where does the ambiguity come in?, A: It lies in the definition of \"natural born.\" Originally, our nations founders had proposed a more liberal approach allowing that those who had lived in the U.S. for a certain period of time could be eligible. They changed their mind to restrict eligibility to those born on U.S. soil, with a few exceptions, such as the children of foreign diplomats, or worse, foreign invaders. , Then an obvious oversight popped up. What about someone born to American citizens who were traveling or working outside the country? The Naturalization Act of 1790 addressed this by declaring \"children of citizens of the United States, that may be born beyond the sea, or out of the limits of the United States, shall be considered as natural-born citizens.\" The law, which has been revised a number of times, had one provision that now seems curious, stating that the right of citizenship did \"not descend to persons whose fathers have never been resident in the United States.\" That stipulation later was dropped. , End of discussion? Not exactly. The use of \"considered as\" has a certain ambiguity in itself, at least to some. There are those who argue that the Constitution should be interpreted literally and that it would have to be amended to allow those born on foreign soil to legally serve as president. , Q: Has this come up before?, A: Yes. John McCain, the Republican nominee in the 2008 presidential race, was born on a U.S. military base in the Panama Canal Zone. When the subject came up, the U.S. Senate passed a unanimous resolution stating that it had no doubt about his eligibility. The matter also was raised, without effect, in the campaigns of Barry Goldwater, born in Arizona before it was a state, and George Romney, who was born to American citizens in Mexico. , President Barack Obamas birthplace was questioned as well during his first campaign. Some claimed he was not born in Hawaii as he said but in Kenya, and they claimed his Hawaiian birth certificate was fraudulent. Though he still would have been eligible to run for president, Obama was denounced by these critics and so-called birthers for having \"lied\" about his birthplace. , Q: Is a challenge to Cruzs eligibility likely to go anywhere?, A: Probably not, but the U.S. Supreme Court never has addressed this matter specifically with respect to presidential eligibility. The Constitution Society, an Austin-based and Libertarian-minded organization, has said, \"Sen. Cruz is not eligible to be president.\" Its argument is based on the notion that natural-born must be related to geography and that \"citizen at birth\" conferred by U.S. laws does not imply eligibility. , This view does not jibe with the scholarly consensus, which is that the Constitution is as clear as it needs to be on this subject - especially in light of long-standing British law at the time it was written. Such law deemed those born to subjects of the Crown even in far-flung outposts of the empire as subjects themselves for any and all purposes. The Framers, scholars say, were all too familiar with that concept, as they had complained vociferously about a lack of representation in parliament. Two recent U.S. solicitor generals write in the current issue of the Harvard Law Review that the eligibility question is a red herring when used to challenge Cruz. \"There are plenty of serious issues to debate in the upcoming presidential election cycle,\" write Neal Katyal and Paul Clement. \"The less time spent dealing with specious objections to candidate eligibility, the better. Fortunately, the Constitution is refreshingly clear on these eligibility issues.\"]", "Date": "20150324", "Title": "[Is foreign-born Cruz eligible to be president?]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Is-foreign-born-Cruz-eligible-to-be-president-6153621.php", "Author": "[By Mike Tolson]"}

Yet his visit was infused with 2016 overtones, and he playfully mocked Republicans who reject mainstream climate science that says humans are contributing to warmer temperatures. , \"I think if you pushed them, theyd probably deny gravity as well,\" Biden said. , The California swing brought Biden to the same corner of the state as the pack of Republican presidential candidates, who descended on the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library for their second televised debate on Wednesday night. Addressing a solar power summit in Anaheim, Biden offered a prediction that viewers would hear more skepticism about climate change from the pack of GOP candidates participating in the debate. , He also called out the billionaire Koch brothers  the Democratic Partys preferred boogeymen  for leading efforts to stymie renewable energy development, though he added sardonically that they were \"fine guys, as I understand it.\", \"We need to set an example for the whole world by eliminating these wasteful, unnecessary subsidies,\" Biden said, arguing that special interests are fighting to preserve federal tax benefits that the energy industry enjoys. , As he considers a late entrance into the 2016 presidential race, Biden has started to speak out more directly against the Republican candidates he would face if he won his partys nomination. Addressing Hispanics at a reception on Tuesday night, he lashed out at GOP front-runner Donald Trump and said his \"sick\" message of xenophobia \"will not prevail.\", Bidens California trip was designed to give a boost to a key element of President Barack Obamas agenda. World leaders are working feverishly to finish a global climate treaty by December, and the vice presidents next stop in California was a U.S.-China Climate Leaders Summit in Los Angeles, where the worlds two largest polluters are aiming to ramp up pressure on other countries to match the ambitious pledges to cap or curb emissions that the U.S. and China have already laid out. , Taking the stage in Los Angeles, Biden cast himself as having been ahead of the curve on climate, citing a bill he introduced in 1986. Calling the U.S.-China relationship critical to fighting climate change, Biden invoked his longstanding relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping, whom Biden courted when he was Chinas vice president. , \"Tell him I miss him,\" he told visiting Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi, who met with Biden at the summit to prepare for Xis state visit to the White House next week. , On the sidelines of the summit, Biden met privately with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, California Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon and mayors from other major U.S. cities. He also squeezed in a session with the secretary-treasurer of the Culinary Workers Union, whose endorsement is key for presidential candidates in the competitive state of Nevada. , The vice president is deeply immersed in deliberations with his family and advisers about whether to enter the 2016 presidential race. In recent days, Biden has opened a window into those deliberations, describing his lingering doubts about whether he has the emotional strength to mount a viable campaign just months after his son, Beau, died from brain cancer. , At the same time, Biden has kept up an intensive travel schedule, crisscrossing Florida, Georgia, New York and now California, stops that have done little to quell speculation that hes laying the groundwork for a potential campaign. On Thursday, Biden planned speeches on transportation and sexual assault in Ohio and Michigan  two battleground states that will play key roles in electing the next president. , In tandem with Bidens trip, the White House announced that 11 Chinese cities and provinces would max out their emissions earlier than Chinas national goal of 2030.

This isnt any other year. , Bidens visits to Ohio and Michigan on Thursday were closely watched for signs hes gauging his support in two states that typically play a key role in electing the next president. As he considers making a late entrance into the 2016 presidential race, his usual vice presidential appearances have taken on the air of campaign stops, with supporters cheering for him to run. , The vice president didnt tip his hand at either stop, eschewing talk of the presidential race for wonkier discourse about infrastructure upgrades and economic development. The closest to a reminder of the political speculation swirling around him came, ironically, at an event in Columbus on the scourge of sexual violence on American college campuses. , At Ohio State University  where President Barack Obama kicked off his victorious re-election campaign three years ago  more than a thousand students packed into a gymnasium and chanted \"Joe, Joe, Joe\" as they waited for Biden to take the stage. When he did, he was met with thunderous cheers as he saluted students and showed off his scarlet tie evoking the schools official colors. , He got a bit of celebrity boost, too, from \"Hunger Games\" star Josh Hutcherson, who flew from Los Angeles with Biden aboard Air Force Two to attend the rally. , \"Every single woman on the plane all of a sudden had no interest in talking to me,\" the vice president quipped. , The sprawling public university of more than 60,000 students announced new steps to prevent sexual violence, including mandatory awareness training for all freshmen starting next year. The school plans to dedicate a team to investigating allegations of sexual misconduct and to partner with a local sexual assault hotline. , Biden told the students it was never appropriate to ask a domestic violence victim what she said or did that led to being victimized. , \"The question we as a nation have we to ask is what made him think he had a right to raise his hand,\" Biden said, his voice rising to a roar. , Its a theme resonating in this years Democratic presidential primary. Earlier this week in Iowa, Hillary Rodham Clinton put forth her plan to try to end sexual assault on campuses. , Like the rally at Ohio State, Bidens visit to Detroit tapped into an issue that has long been central to Bidens identity as a political leader  and could play an equally important role in his message to voters should he choose to run for president. , Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan joined Biden at the citys transportation headquarters, where the vice president got behind the wheel of one of the citys new hybrid and clean diesel buses, purchased with help from federal grants. Standing in front of the extra-long bus with a city driver, Biden said hed once been a school bus driver  but wasnt sure he could handle one like this. , \"This is cool, man,\" said the vice president. , Ohio and Michigan are among a handful of states that are competitive for Democrats and Republicans, although Michigan has trended Democratic in recent presidential elections.

The US Supreme Court ruled Friday that gay marriage is a nationwide right, a landmark decision in one of the most keenly awaited announcements in decades and sparking scenes of jubilation. , The chimes of liberty rang in harmony with wedding bells Friday, when the U.S. Supreme Court announced in a 5-4 ruling that states must recognize same-sex marriage. , It is a striking shift from little more than a decade ago, during the 2004 presidential election, when President George W. Bush was advocating for a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. Now, according to the Boston Globe, the former president recently offered to officiate a lesbian wedding. , Thats a change in attitude thats swept the entire nation. Over the past decade, public opinion has shifted from majority opposed to same-sex marriage to majority support. President Barack Obama himself evolved on the issue after declining to endorse marriage for same-sex couples in 2008. , Even the dissenters are changing their tone. Moral apocalypticism and the \"homosexual agenda\" were the key themes in Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalias opinion in the 2003 case Lawrence v. Texas, which held that anti-sodomy laws were unconstitutional. Now, in his dissent to todays Obergefell v. Hodges decision, Scalia merely remarks that gay marriage \"is not of immense personal importance to me.\", A few more years at this rate and Scalia will be joining his colleagues in officiating same-sex weddings. , The politics of love is winning out over the politics of hate. , Here in Houston, however, we still have to deal with the politics of obstinance. People have known for months that this decision was coming down the Supreme Court pipeline, and the legalistic tea leaves were showing signs that same-sex marriage would be the end result. Yet Harris County Clerk Stan Stanart spent his days dilly-dallying, refusing to update his office for this predictable scenario.  His actions left Harris County tarnished as one of the sole major population centers that was not prepared to immediately issue licenses upon the Supreme Courts decision, despite an opinion from Harris County Attorney Vince Ryans office instructing otherwise. If Stanart cannot follow the Supreme Courts decision, then he should feel free to resign. , While Harris County was issuing marriage licenses by the afternoon, the Gov. Greg Abbott continues to stand in the doorway. Our governor issued a memo Friday claiming that state employees could ignore the law if it was their sincerely held religious belief. He also set out on Twitter to remark that \"Marriage was defined by God. No man can redefine it. We will defend our religious liberties.\", Ignoring the fact that man has constantly redefined marriage (how many decades ago were wives considered a husbands property?) this attitude glibly ignores the many religious institutions that do recognize same-sex marriage, including many Presbyterian and Lutheran churches, and Reform and Conservative synagogues. The First Amendment well protects those religions that dont want to take part in same-sex weddings, but until todays decision, there was little to protect those that do. , Despite todays victory, the struggle for equality isnt over. For decades, representatives in Washington have proposed the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of sexual identity - similar to Houstons own equal rights ordinance. \"Now that marriage is a done deal, thats going to be the next shift,\" Houston GLBT caucus President Maverick Welsh told the Chronicle editorial board. , The words of angry politicians, and the actions of stubborn ones, cannot stop the march of equality. From coast to coast, the bedrock institution of marriage has been opened to consenting couples of all kinds, strengthening the American society and adding new ranks to the next generation of stable, two-parent households. The highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice and family have new allies.And the chimes of liberty will continue to ring. ]", "Date": "20150626", "Title": "[Chimes of liberty]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/editorials/article/Chimes-of-liberty-6351719.php", "Author": "[Copyright 2015: Houston Chronicle]"}
{"Content": "[ Caption, Close, Voters  in the Harris County Courthouse branch  in Pasadena in 2013. , In its recommendations for criminal district judge positions in Harris County, the Houston Chronicle noted that some candidates made comments indicating a lack of objectivity. (\"Criminal courts, Part 1,\" Page B10, Oct. 2 and \"Criminal courts, Part 2, Page B6, Oct. 3) The Harris County Criminal Lawyers Association applauds the Chronicles call for fairness and objectivity by our judges and judicial candidates. , The largest local criminal-defense bar in the country, with over 800 members, the association does not endorse any individual or either party. Even though judges are forced to work within a partisan system of elections, they should be above politics and follow the Constitution and the law. , Our criminal justice system is an emblem of our standards of humanity. Fair dealing must be certain for those who find themselves accused of crimes. Judges play an important role in this process and are the first and last check in a system that must keep its promise to give every accused person a fair trial, no matter which political party is in power. , Political consultants typically advise judicial candidates to appear \"tough on crime\" because the voting public confuses justice with crime-fighting. Judges and candidates do our community a disservice by promoting this misguided view. Our current \"tough-on-crime\" mentality has caused Texas to lead the nation in exonerations of the wrongfully convicted. Judges should be neither tough on crime nor soft on crime but instead fair and impartial, following the law wherever it leads. , The law requires judges to protect the citizens from their prosecutors. The public is only protected if our judges have the integrity to enforce the law despite contrary public opinion. The judiciary must be free to act on the law even when their decisions benefit defendants. Any judge who substitutes his or her own political beliefs for the law is not qualified to sit on the bench and certainly should not be given the tremendous responsibility of making life or death decisions. A judge who views himself or herself as doing the job of a prosecutor engages in the worst sort of judicial activism, impeding the separation of powers and insulting the memory of those who have fought to protect our constitutional freedoms. , A judge serves the public by enforcing the Texas and U.S. Constitutions, which our forefathers wrote to protect us from an overreaching government. The job of a judge is critical: to protect us by enforcing the constitutions without regard to whether doing so will benefit a particular defendant. The public is protected - from unfairness, from false accusations and ultimately from tyranny - only when judges have the integrity to enforce the law despite the tide of public opinion. , But it takes courage to do the right thing despite the weight of public opinion. While craven candidates pander to fear and ignorance, the courageous deserve our support, the endorsement of the Chronicle and most of all, the support of the public at large.

{"Content": "[ Caption, Close, When he was Texas attorney general, Greg Abbott, now the governor, filed a lawsuit challenging President Obamas order shielding millions from deportation. Texas was joined by more than two dozen states in the lawsuit. , The highly controversial executive order issued by President Obama caused a backlash from many in the GOP. See how the order, which has been blocked by a judge, would impact the nation if its eventually enforced. , 1. Parents, 2. Children, 3. Prioritizing deportations, 4. Law enforcement, 5. Border security, 6. Salaries, 7. Business programs, 8. Green cards, AUSTIN - A federal judge late Monday halted President Barack Obamas landmark immigration order on the eve of its implementation, denying millions of people illegally in America access to work permits and dealing a victory to Gov. Greg Abbott in his lawsuit against the program. , The decision from Judge Andrew Hanen, based in Brownsville, did not declare the executive action unconstitutional but said it should not take effect until the legal questions have been settled. , \"Once these services are provided,\" Hanen wrote in a 123-page ruling, \"there will be no effective way of putting the toothpaste back in the tube should the plaintiffs ultimately prevail.\", Immigration activists had been bracing for an unfavorable decision from Hanen, an appointee of former President George W. Bush to the Southern District of Texas. He previously has expressed skepticism at the federal governments ability to enforce the law at the border. , The White House cast the ruling as a temporary set-back. , \"The Supreme Court and Congress have made clear that the federal government can set priorities in enforcing our immigration lawswhich is exactly what the President did when he announced commonsense policies to help fix our broken immigration system,\" according to a statement. , The administration is expected to appeal the decision to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. , Still, Texas Republicans late Monday night cheered the ruling as a clear rebuttal of Obamas policy. , Attorney General Ken Paxton called it a \"crucial first step in reining in President Obamas lawlessness,\" and Abbott said it \"rightly stops the presidents overreach in its tracks.\", \"We live in a nation governed by a system of checks and balances, and the presidents attempt to by-pass the will of the American people was successfully checked today,\" Abbott said in a statement. , Led by Abbott, Texas and 25 other states had argued that Obama unconstitutionally sidestepped Congress when he took executive action last November to shield from deportation up to 5 million immigrants in the country illegally. , That number included an estimated 170,000 in Harris County, about a third of all such immigrants in the region, and more than half a million in other parts of Texas, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data. , The states argued they will have to pay the costs of providing services to those here illegally. , Texas led a 17-state coalition when Abbott filed the lawsuit last December while serving as the states attorney general. The number of states that have signed on to the challenge has since grown to 26. , The Obama administration defended the move as within the presidents authority and consistent with other actions taken by presidents of both parties. , Hanens ruling arrived two days before U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services was set to start accepting applications for the program. , It also came as Congress is debating how to fund the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration laws. The decision could give Republicans some leverage in that fight. , Democrats expressed optimism about an appeal but said even a temporary delay in providing work permits would hurt people who had done nothing wrong. , \"We are talking about Texas students who know no other country but the United States, and parents of U.S. citizen children,\" said state Rep.

{"Content": "[ Caption, Close, While many experts believe that presidential candidate Donald Trumps candidacy will be short-lived, polling data and  comments from voters in primary states indicate that his appeal is based on his boldness and attitude rather than his policy positions. , Live soap opera, , Regarding \"Trump driving GOP immigrant debate\" (Page A1, Tuesday), the Republican Party is now hostage to its own creation. Donald Trump, whom they had no problems with when he was attacking President Obamas American citizenship, now takes the lead in defining their immigration policy. This is the same problem they often have. When someone first starts inappropriate rhetoric there are rarely enough people in the room who say \"no.\", Americans will just have to live with the results if they elect Trump or any other Republican who seems to be falling in line with the soap opera that is playing out in the GOP. , Europeans and other outsiders are laughing or scratching their heads at the new dynamics working in our political system. Republicans will have to decide for themselves if Trumps prior self assessment that he will win the Hispanic vote can possibly be true after this plan. , Ron Curtis, Houston, , Maturity challenged, Regarding \"Tough stance at Waco hearing\" (Page B1, Tuesday), I am struck as to how stupid this whole episode is. We are in the 15th year of the 21st century and we still have grown men acting like 10-year-olds running around with guns trying to prove who controls the playground. Stop and think about this for a moment: two bands of grown men fighting over who gets to wear a patch on their motorcycle jacket to show \"superiority.\", Why dont they worry about teaching children to read? Or spend their time repairing houses for old, poor people?, Frankly, I think we should throw them all in jail for a year and force them to attend manners and maturity classes. We could have meal time like we had in summer camp 60 years ago - alternating seating for different gang members; i.e. , one of one group next to one of the other group, etc. , Stan Thurber, Spring, , Exploiters benefit, Regarding \"Immigration enforcement misunderstood\" (Page B5, Monday), Ruben Navarrette Jr. again has nailed it when he states that the key to controlling illegal immigration is the enforcement of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and the arrest and prosecution of companies and individuals who knowingly employ illegal immigrants. By doing this, jobs for immigrants in the country illegally would disappear, and there would be no reason for them to come here.  All of the rhetoric and soul searching being put forth by the current presidential candidates is pointless. Common sense tells us that this is the real solution to the problem and that there is no need to build walls and patrol the border with thousands of agents. , The only reason that this has not been done a long time ago is that the industries which profit the most from exploiting illegal immigrant labor are represented by powerful lobby groups in Washington, D.C. , and have persuaded congressmen and administrations to look the other way for many years. Hopefully we will end up with a new president and Congress that does not cave in to lobbyists. , Ralph Tibiletti, Spring, , Rail woes on track , Regarding \"New contract fight costing Metro $1 million\" (Page B3, Wednesday), the article describing Metros problems with the company contracted to deliver 39 rail cars glosses over the most glaring error of the board: \"The company ran into problems complying with requirements for American-made products.\",  It was the board that created problems by attempting to circumvent the American-made provisions of the federal money grant by complying with the letter of the regulation rather than the spirit. , Someone needs to remind the board that Metro exists to better the quality of the greater Houston area and spending $150 million with a Spanish firm does a great disservice to our areas and our countrys citizens. , Bill Spear Bartlett, Houston]", "Date": "20150819", "Title": "[Thursday letters: Trump opera, Waco flap, Metro rail]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/letters/article/Thursday-letters-Trump-opera-Waco-flap-Metro-6454047.php", "Author": "[Copyright 2015: Houston Chronicle]"}

Scott Walker shakes hands as he announces he is running for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination at the Waukesha County Expo Center, Monday, July 13, 2015, in Waukesha, Wis. , WAUKESHA, Wis. (AP)  Scott Walker vowed Monday to fight for Americas interests abroad and for his conservative policies in Washington, launching a 2016 Republican presidential bid by highlighting his clashes with labor unions as his campaign taunted his Democratic critics. , The 47-year-old second-term governor embraced his \"fighter\" reputation as he formally declared his candidacy in an evening speech, his family at his side, and protesters gathered just outside the convention hall. , \"We are running to serve as your president of the United States of America,\" Walker declared. , \"Americans deserve a president who will fight and win for them,\" he said. \"You see, it doesnt matter if youre from a big city, a suburb or a small town, I will fight and win for you. Healthy or sick, born or unborn, I will fight and win for you.\", He becomes the 15th high-profile Republican to enter the GOP presidential contest, yet claims to occupy a unique space in the congested field. He not only fights for conservative principles, he says, but he also wins elections and policy debates in a state that typically supports Democrats. , Speaking in the same hall where he celebrated his successful recall election three years earlier, Walker left little doubt that his successful, if divisive, fights with labor unions would serve as the foundation for his presidential campaign. Through five years in office, he enacted policies weakening organized labors political power and became the first governor in U.S. history to defeat a recall election. , Labor unions spent millions of dollars to defeat him, but failed. , \"Scott Walker is a national disgrace,\" said AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, among the many detractors who lashed out against Walkers candidacy on Monday. , Walker also highlighted a series of lesser-known triumphs he says set him apart from the crowded Republican field. , He cut income and corporate taxes by nearly $2 billion, lowered property taxes, legalized the carrying of concealed weapons, made abortions more difficult to obtain, required photo identification when voting and made Wisconsin a right-to-work state. , His budget this year, which plugged a $2.2 billion shortfall when he signed it into law Sunday, requires drug screenings for public benefit recipients, expands the private school voucher program, freezes tuition at the University of Wisconsin while cutting funding by $250 million and removing tenure protections from state law. , Such achievements may appeal to conservatives who hold outsized sway in Republican primaries, yet some could create challenges in a general election should Walker ultimately become the GOPs nominee. Voter ID laws, abortion restrictions, liberal gun policies and education cuts are not necessarily popular among swing-state independents. , Walkers record is well-known to Wisconsin voters, a state where the second-term governor engenders fierce loyalty and fierce opposition. Protesters who first crowded the state Capitol in 2011 in demonstrations as large as 100,000 still gather daily, although only about a dozen or so at a time, to sing anti-Walker songs. , Dozens of protesters gathered Monday on the street outside the arena carrying signs that read \"Waukesha Against Walker!\" and \"Walker is a bully and a liar!\", Mary Mezera, a 46-year-old education research coordinator at UW-Madison, said she lost all union representation in the wake of Walkers public union restriction and is especially upset over the governor signing bills that make it more difficult to obtain an abortion in Wisconsin. , \"I hope hell fall flat on his face,\" Mezera said. , Walker begins his 2016 presidential bid with at least $20 million to spread his message, raised by two outside groups not subject to campaign finance donation limits, according to sources with direct knowledge of the fundraising operation. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to publicly discuss private fundraising strategy. , While he has limited international experience, Walkers speech outlined a muscular foreign policy that would include more American forces in combat. , He called for lifting the political restrictions on U.S. troops stationed in Iraq \"so they can help our Kurd and Sunni allies reclaim land taken by ISIS.\", \"On behalf of your children and mine,\" he said, \"Id rather take the fight to them than wait for them to bring the fight to us.\", Walker also highlighted rising test scores and graduation rates in Wisconsin as evidence that the 2011 union law worked. , What he didnt mention is Wisconsins graduation rates were increasing for years before he took office, and the recent growth is not as strong as the national average. Wisconsins ACT scores have been among the best in the nation since before Walker was elected. They ranked third the year before he took office and ranked second in 2012. , Critics note that Walker too often ignores where hes fallen short. , The states chief economic development agency that Walker created, a hybrid public-private partnership, has been beset with problems, including handing out $124 million in loans without properly vetting the recipients. Walker was over 100,000 jobs short on his signature 2010 campaign promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs. , Hes also been dogged by two investigations, neither of which have yet to result in charges filed against him.

Here are some things you should know about whos involved, why and what happens next. ,  Who is Rosemary Lehmberg? Lehmberg is the Travis County District Attorney. In 2013, she was arrested for drunk driving. After her arrest, a complaint was filed and Perry threatened to veto funding if she did not resign from the DA position. Lehmberg plead guilty to driving while intoxicated and served 45 days in prison, but kept her job. , How did it start?While Lehmberg was in jail, the political pressure to resign from the district attorney position began to mount. Perry threatened to veto funding for the Public Integrity Unit if Lehmberg didnt resign. On June 14th, 2013, Perry followed through on the threat. A special grand jury was called to look into both Perrys veto threat and Lehmbergs arrest. It later found Lehmberg did not commit any wrongdoing in the process of her arrest and jail time and a judge ruled she was allowed to stay in office. , What is Perrys history? Rick Perry has been the Republican Governor of Texas since 2000 and is widely believed to be planning for another presidential run after his failed attempt in 2012. This indictment is the first of a Texas governor since 1917. , Who is on Perrys legal team?Mark Fabiani is the latest addition to the legal Dream Team Perry has assembled to fight his indictment. Fabiani comes to the team with experience working with Democrats, having served President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. Ben Ginsberg is most famous for working for President George W. Bush during his 2000 election run. Ginsberg and Fabiani fought on opposite sides of the fence for their candidates. Tony Buzbee, a Houston-area attorney, leads the Perry legal team. Buzbee is often described as a tough and mean trial lawyer highly experienced with taking on big businesses and winning. David Botsford is an Austin attorney specializing in criminal defense. Bobby Birchfield, like Ginsberg, also is a former general counsel to President George W. Bush. Tom Phillips rounds out the legal team as a retired Chief Justice of the Texas Supreme Court.  From left, David Botsford, Tony Buzbee, Bobby Birchfield and Ben Ginsberg (not pictured: Mark Fabiani), What is the Public Integrity Unit? The Public Integrity Unit is a department under the Travis County District Attorneys office. The role of this unit is to look into cases involving government crime such as corruption and fraud. , What is the governor being charged with? A Travis County grand jury indicted the governor on two felony charges. Abuse of official capacity is a first-degree felony  and carries a five-to 99-year prison sentence while coercion of a public official is a third-degree felony and is punishable by two to 10 years in prison. , What is Perrys take on the indictment?On the day Gov. Perry arrived at the Travis County Jail to take his booking photo and get fingerprints done, he delivered a short statement to the public saying, \"Im going to enter this courthouse with my head held high knowing that the actions I took were not only lawful and legal but right. If I had to do so, I would veto funding for the public integrity unit again. Im going to fight this injustice with every fiber of my being. And we will prevail. This indictment is fundamentally a political act that seeks to achieve at the courthouse what could not be achieved at the ballot box.\", , Whats next for Perry?

City Council was to meet in special session to consider - and likely approve - the exchange. Church members had been scheduled to vote on the proposal, which had unanimously been endorsed by the churchs executive council, finance committee and deacon body, on Sunday. , The proposal by the city to exchange its property at 3826 Milton St. for a parcel of church-owned property adjacent to City Hall became the center of a fierce controversy that led to a slate of City Council candidates opposed to the swap being swept into office, replacing term limited officialsin a May 9 election. , Mayor Bob Fry, who favored the proposal, said the church notified him of its decision at 9 p.m. Wednesday. The planned 6:30 p.m. Thursday special council session has been cancelled. \"I am very disappointed,\" said Fry, who did not seek re-election. \"It was obvious that this action would have been in the citys best long-term interest.\", In a letter to his congregation, West University Pastor Roger Patterson noted that, \"The last few months have been difficult. The political processes and dynamics were not of our own making. The church has suffered through numerous public and private attacks, which, while difficult to endure, were understandable considering the divisive political climate. Our prayer throughout this process has been that we fulfill His purpose and do nothing if it does not glorify God and His kingdom.\", City Councilman-elect Bob Kelly Thursday hailed the church decision, saying, \"I am very happy about this decision. It was the reasonable thing for the (church) to do.\", The controversy grew out of the citys 2014 decision to propose the land swap when it learned that West University Baptist planned to build a youth center on its property adjacent to City Hall. City leaders at that point were crafting a municipal master plan that envisioned the eventual relocation of the city library and other structures to a campus-like setting around City Hall. The city hoped to give the church its Milton Street property, which currently is the site of the municipal vehicle maintenance facility. Had the plan gone through, that shop would have been relocated. , In battling the proposed swap, opponents launched a successful petition drive to force a November referendum on the issuance of $3 million in bonds needed to relocate the shop.

(AP)  Opponents of raising the states gas tax to fund roadwork are stepping up their efforts while the Legislatures not in session in an attempt to shift the debate from funding to reform. , Debate on the issue lawmakers called their top priority for 2015  fixing South Carolinas deteriorating roads  will resume in January. A bill providing roughly $800 million additional yearly to the Department of Transportation through taxes and fees has special debate status in the Senate when legislators return. , Anti-tax activists are working the phones to secure GOP senators opposition in 2016, when every legislator is up for re-election. , \"Before we talk about dollars, weve got to reform the system,\" said Dave Schwartz, state director of Americans for Prosperity. Its joined with the Coastal Conservation League, the South Carolina Policy Council and the Campaign for Liberty in pushing the reform-first mantra. , The groups applaud Sen. Tom Davis, R-Beaufort, who filibustered to prevent a vote this year. Davis said his mission over the next five months is to educate voters on his arguments. He believes no tax hike is needed. , \"Yeah, weve got a horrible road and bridge problem, but it wont be solved by putting more money in a system thats broken,\" he said. , But other legislators and business leaders say thats just political spin that wont fix the problem. They contend more money will be needed regardless of any reforms. , \"Any state agency could always use reform. We support reform, but trying to say we cant talk about funding at the same time, we think, is a mistake,\" said Ted Pitts, president of the state Chamber of Commerce and a former House member. \"Its really just a delay game.\", The arguments are a repeat of 2007, he said. , That was the last time the Legislature passed a law reforming the Department of Transportation. It put the agency in the governors Cabinet and required the DOT to fund road projects based on need. , \"When you dont want to fix something, you say, Well reform it. We reformed it in 2007 but never funded it,\" said Sen. Ray Cleary, R-Murrells Inlet, who led Senate Finances road-funding panel. , The DOT has said it needs an additional $1.5 billion annually over the next 25 years to bring all state-maintained roadways to good condition. The states highway system consists of 41,400 miles of roads, making it the nations fourth-largest. Its funded largely by the nations third-lowest gas tax and the federal matches that 16.75 cents per gallon brings. , The reform-first groups say DOTs revenue needs cant be discerned until reforms are enacted. They argue those reforms must include abolishing both the legislatively appointed DOT commission and the State Infrastructure Bank, noting two legislative leaders appoint most of its board. , The bank, which loans money for large road projects, is exempt from the 2007 laws priority-funding requirements. , Policy Council President Ashley Landess says money diverted to the bank subtracts from DOTs maintenance of existing miles. , According to the DOT, it will transfer about $110 million to the bank this year. That includes $27 million through its 1-cent-per-gallon share of the gas tax, $31 million for debt payments, and $50 million as required by a 2013 law that sends half of vehicle sales taxes to the bank. , Rep.

{"Content": "[ CONCORD, N.H. (AP)  A federal judge on Thursday upheld a New Hampshire law the Libertarian Party argued could prevent its candidates from getting on the ballot. , Libertarians sued Secretary of State William Gardner last year, challenging new limits on how long parties have to collect signatures to petition their way onto the ballot. State law requires a third party to collect signatures equal to 3 percent of the total votes cast during the prior election. Under the change, parties cant begin gathering signatures until Jan. 1 of the election year. , In a ruling Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Paul Barbadoro said the law creates reasonable restrictions that are justified by the states interest in requiring parties to demonstrate a sufficient level of support. , \"Reasonable minds can and do disagree about the wisdom of this countrys present two-party political structure, and there is little question that, for better or worse, (this law) promotes that structure to at least some degree by making it marginally more difficult for third parties to gain ballot access in New Hampshire,\" he wrote. But the law does not impose a severe burden on ballot access, he said, and is therefore constitutional. , In 2012, the Libertarian Party ran candidates for president, vice president, congressional seats and several state-level seats after collecting the necessary signatures. But it began the collection process in 2011. For the 2016 election, it would need to collect 14,864 signatures. Represented by the New Hampshire Civil Liberties Union, the party argued that the window for collecting signatures is even shorter than what the law specifies given New Hampshires harsh winters. Barbadoro was unpersuaded. He said snowstorms and bitter cold may limit petition gathering, but the party could use that time for fundraising and volunteer recruitment. , Libertarians also argued that the time limit effectively prevents the party from meaningfully participating in the general election because it would have to use its limited resources on collecting signatures instead of campaigning and fundraising. Barbadoro said the major parties face a similar obstacle when they have to focus on primary elections that come less than two months before the general election. , \"The challenge that political parties of all sizes face to manage multiple tasks at once, even in an election year  to both walk and chew gum, so to speak  is a simple and essential fact of American political life, not cause for heightened constitutional scrutiny,\" he wrote. , Gilles Bissonnette, legal director of the New Hampshire ACLU, said the party is considering an appeal. , \"This law limits voter choice and stacks the deck against candidates who  like roughly 40 percent of Granite Staters  dont belong to a major party,\" he said.]", "Date": "20150827", "Title": "[Judge rejects Libertarian Party's ballot access challenge]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/article/Judge-rejects-Libertarian-Party-s-ballot-access-6469876.php", "Author": "[Holly Ramer, Associated Press]"}

Sylvester Turner later called for reform in the prosecution of low-level drug offenses. , \"There are far too many people that are languishing in our jails and really should not have to go to a bail bondsman at all, because the offenses they are committing are so minor they shouldnt be there,\" Turner said, pointing to Blands case. \"We should reform the system. We need to be smarter.\", Turner also said Houston is under-policed and referenced his proposal to expand its police department by 540 officers over five years, which he estimated would cost $85 million. , Garcia agreed, though he did not specify how many officers he would hire, pointing instead to a need for efficiency in light of the citys looming $126 million budget deficit. , Other forum questions addressed ReBuild Houston, the citys controversial infrastructure improvement program, pension reform, income inequality and the citys embattled nondiscrimination ordinance, known as HERO. , To close out the event, candidates were asked a series of six \"lightning round\" questions, to which they were allowed one-word answers. , Heres how they came down:, 1.\\tWill you vote for the equal rights ordinance?Yes: Bell, Costello, Garcia, McVey, TurnerNo: HallAbstain: King, 2.\\tDo you support a change in the term limit length for councilmen and mayor in the city of Houston from two to four years?Yes: Bell, Hall, McVey, TurnerNo: Costello, Garcia, King, 3.\\tShould we repeal the revenue cap?Yes: Bell, Turner (for certain exceptions)No: Costello, Garcia, Hall, King, McVey, 4.\\tShould it be mandatory to meet and confer with all municipal unions?Yes: King, McVey, Garcia, BellNo: Hall, Turner, Costello, 5.\\tInfrastructure funding: debt or revenue financing?Debt: Hall, KingRevenue: Turner, McVey, Garcia, Costello, Bell, 6.\\tZero-based budgeting: yes or no?Yes: King, Hall, Turner, McVey, Garcia, Costello, BellNo: N/A]", "Date": "20150819", "Title": "[Candidates talk criminal justice at mayoral forum]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/houston/article/Candidates-talk-criminal-justice-at-mayoral-forum-6454520.php", "Author": "[By Rebecca Elliott]"}

{"Content": "[ FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP)  Politicians who may have thought they wouldnt have to say much at all about gay marriage once the U.S. Supreme Court effectively legalized it now must answer a different question: Do you support Kim Davis?, The Rowan County clerk, who has become a darling of many conservatives despite being a Democrat, cited \"Gods authority\" and religious liberty in choosing jail time over issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Some social conservatives have cast Davis as a hero, shifting the gay marriage debate from one about civil liberties  a matter that appeared to have been settled  to one about religious liberty. , Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a Baptist preacher running for president but trailing badly in the polls, rushed to Davis side and said it was unfair the government would not accommodate her beliefs. A judge ultimately freed Davis on the condition she not interfere with her deputies issuing the licenses. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz also traveled to Morehead to bask in her defiance. And Kentucky Republican governor hopeful Matt Bevin has tried to capitalize on her recent celebrity. , Others find themselves in a more awkward position. Jack Conway, the Democratic nominee in the states closely watched governors race, eventually declined to defend the states gay marriage ban as attorney general and now must dodge attacks from Bevin, even though both candidates favor carving out an exemption in state law for Davis. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whose presidential campaign has focused more on economics than social issues, first said Davis should follow the rule of law. But in last weeks GOP presidential debate, he agreed that \"there needs to be an accommodation for someone acting on their faith.\", In the same debate, former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum compared Davis to a student killed in the Columbine High School massacre who reportedly told one of the gunmen she believed in God before she was shot. And Huckabee said it wasnt fair that the government allowed the suspected Fort Hood shooter to grow a beard in prison for religious reasons but would not accommodate Davis beliefs. , Piggybacking on Davis fight could be risky because she refused to fulfill her duties as an elected official and defied several federal court orders, said Matt Mackowiak, who leads the Super PAC \"Fight for Kentucky\" that is supporting Bevin. He said any ad built around Davis would have to be \"very, very carefully constructed.\", \"You dont have to defend every decision she made and the ramification of every decision she made,\" Mackowiak said, adding he has not decided if his group will make ads based on Davis and the gay marriage issue. \"Its a pretty narrow situation, but you know it does raise the question: Do you believe in religious liberty?\", Bevin spoke at a jailhouse rally telling the crowd of thousands to share Davis story with their neighbors and \"bring them to the polls with you.\" But since she has been released from jail, he has mostly used Davis as an avenue to remind voters that Conway, as the attorney general, chose not to appeal a federal judges order overturning Kentuckys constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. Kentucky voters approved that amendment in 2004 with 75 percent of the vote. His first television ad, released Friday, made no mention of gay marriage. , Although populist Democrats have maintained a foothold in Kentucky, an otherwise socially conservative state, others in the party also have been subject to attacks. Republican Casey County Clerk Casey Davis called Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear \"a warrior against Christianity\" because he refuses to call a special session of the state legislature to pass a law exempting Kim Davis and him from issuing marriage licenses. Randy Smith, a pastor from Morehead, told the crowd: \"No action by Steve equals no votes for Andy,\" a reference to Beshears son, Andy, who is the Democratic nominee for attorney general. , \"Im asking everybody I can to make sure that we hold the governor responsible for his inaction by holding Andy Beshear responsible and not allowing him to be the next attorney general,\" Smith said. , However, Davis full impact on the November and 2016 elections remains to be seen. The rallies for Davis have been swarmed by supporters from other states, and Steve Beshear won more than 60 percent of the vote in Davis county in the past two elections. , Andy Beshear, whose campaign declined comment, has not shied away from his father: He released two TV ads last week featuring his father, saying his parents taught him the values of \"family, faith, integrity and hard work.\", Conway has handled the issue with care, believing it to be inflamed by emotional rhetoric. Hes betting things will calm down now that Davis is out of jail and her office issuing licenses. , \"No, the race hasnt changed. I think passions are high but I think the majority of Kentuckians want to see people follow the law,\" Conway said. \"Nothing that happened in Rowan County did anything to advance education or job creation in this state.\", ", "Date": "20150920", "Title": "[Gay marriage fight shifts as politicians spy an opportunity]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/us/article/Gay-marriage-fight-shifts-as-politicians-spy-an-6517319.php", "Author": "[Adam Beam, Associated Press]"}
{"Content": "[ HONOLULU (AP)  A lawsuit filed Thursday is challenging an election solely for Native Hawaiians, saying its unconstitutional to restrict voting to those who have Native Hawaiian ancestry. , The lawsuit filed in federal court wants to stop a vote planned for November to elect delegates for a convention to determine self-governance for Native Hawaiians. There are a wide range of opinions and options for Hawaiian self-determination, and next years convention will allow Native Hawaiians to participate in that process, according to Nai Aupuni, the organization guiding the election, convention and ratification process. , The Native Hawaiian Roll Commission was launched in 2012 as part of a state law recognizing Native Hawaiians as the only indigenous people of the islands.

{"Content": "[ Houston Community College trustee and longtime anti-gay activist Dave Wilson has submitted a city charter amendment petition seeking a November vote to bar men \"who perceive or express themselves as women\" from entering womens restrooms, but it appears he misread state law and submitted about 300 fewer signatures than he needs to qualify for the ballot. , Wilson delivered 19,707 signatures to City Hall on Tuesday morning, but state law requires those seeking a city charter change to submit 20,000 signatures or signatures from 5 percent of qualified voters, whichever is smaller. Mayoral spokeswoman Janice Evans said the city wasnt sure yet about the law surrounding Wilsons petition but would offer an opinion this afternoon. , Wilson, standing beside his white pickup containing six boxes full of signatures, said he needs only 17,269 signatures -- 10 percent of the votes cast in the last mayoral election, and the threshold for repealing an ordinance, not a charter change. , Wilsons proposed charter revision is a pointed challenge to the citys legally embattled equal rights ordinance, passed last May, that opponents perceive as allowing men dressed in drag to enter a womens restroom. , \"My whole point is, do you want your mother to be in a womans restroom and a man walk in on that?\" Wilson said. \"I dont think so. Thats totally out of the question.\", Before City Council passed the ordinance 11-6 last May, largely conservative Christian foes dubbed it the \"Sexual Predators Act.\" A petition seeking to repeal the ordinance has already been submitted and is currently at the center of litigation against the city. , The law bans discrimination based not just on sexual orientation and gender identity but also, as federal laws do, sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status. , The ordinance applies to businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting. Religious institutions are exempt. , The specific language of Wilsons charter amendment seeks to define gender identity \"as an individuals innate identification, as either male or female, which is assigned at birth.\" It would require businesses to adopt the same definition. , Wilson was joined by Steve Hotze, another local anti-gay activist, as he unloaded the boxes of signatures. , \"Youre talking about a bunch of perverts that are going to womens bathrooms,\" Hotze said. \"Thats wrong, guys.\", Mayor Annise Parker, nearing the end of her final term, has vowed to fight any anti-HERO legislation that might end up on the November ballot. , \"The voters who have elected me nine times consecutively dont believe in discrimination,\" Parker said last week. \"And since Im not on the ballot this November if it were to suddenly end up there I would devote all my time and energy to defending it.\", But its also unclear if the petition will pass muster with the citys legal department. Then-City Attorney David Feldman raised questions last May about whether Wilsons proposed charter revision might too closely resemble the equal rights ordinance repeal petition. Those seeking to repeal an ordinance once it has gone into effect must submit their petition within 30 days. , The equal rights ordinance repeal referendum petition met that requirement, though the city later rejected it for not having enough valid signatures. But Wilsons petition would be about nine months late by that logic. , Wilson objected to that interpretation, calling it a \"flimsy\" legal argument. He said he is seeking a charter change because it is more substantive than simply repealing the ordinance, not to circumvent the daunting 30-day turnaround to collect signatures. , If the city rejects his petition on the grounds that it was subject to the 30-day time frame, Wilson said he plans to go to the courts. That means the city would potentially be fighting two equal rights ordinance-related legal battles at once. , The challenge over the repeal referendum petition appears to be at least one week away from a formal ruling, but even then its likely bound for the appellate courts.]", "Date": "20150407", "Title": "[Anti-HERO charter petition arrives at City Hall]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/houston/article/Anti-HERO-charter-petition-arrives-at-City-Hall-6183974.php", "Author": "[By Katherine Driessen]"}
{"Content": "[ If anyone should be feeling an overwhelming sense of Groundhog Day this presidential election, cest moi, Frankly, Ive been covering Bushes for so long, I feel like I ought to be parachuting out of airplanes. In fact, the arc of my career parallels the so-called Bush Dynasty, beginning in 1980 when I was a young reporter for the Charleston (S.C.) Evening Post. , That was the first year South Carolina held a Republican presidential primary and its been the \"First in the South\" ever since. , Recognizing the historic importance of the 1980 race, my papers editors split the state into east and west and assigned two reporters to cover the terrain. The other reporter was a classic from central casting - a chain-smoking political veteran aptly named Jack Roach. , Taking off in different directions, we traversed the state, filing three columns a week - on typewriters, with no spellcheck I might add. , Memorably, I found myself one night in a Charleston hotel room with Ronald and Nancy Reagan. I dont recall how I got there, but I was pretty good at wiggling into places I didnt belong, probably because I looked about 12 years old. Though my intent was to interview Reagan, my confidence was rendered null by my having to explain to the future president that my parents didnt need to know where I was. , This may also explain why my favorite of the bunch was George H.W. Bush, who was courtly, kind, handsome and, most important, treated me as if I were his equal. This was more than a paternal gesture but spoke to his quality, character and class - the thread that runs through my nearly 30 years exposure to and experience with the Bush family. , By the time the senior Bush became president in 1988, I was writing a different sort of column, more lifestyle than politics, and was busy with motherhood. But his defeat four years later by Bill Clinton, thanks largely to the chart-happy vote siphon Ross Perot, signaled a turning point in American culture and, therefore, in my column and my politics. , Lifestyle and politics suddenly collided. , After the national trauma of the Clinton years, during which mothers like me were forced to shield our children from the presidents deeds, it was a relief to see George W. and Laura Bush move into the White House. If nothing else was certain, at least no one would have to worry about blue dresses, knee pads and cigars. , I became familiar with these Bushes, as their years in office coincided with my own migration to Washington. , I remember a comment George W. Bush made to me during a one-on-one, in-flight interview. He said the toughest moment of his life wasnt what to do after 9/11 but seeing his father - \"this fine, fine man\" - defeated by Clinton. I thought for a moment he might cry, but of course he wouldnt. , I also got to know Laura Bush when she invited Greta Van Susteren and me to travel with her to the Middle East to launch a breast cancer awareness program in four countries. ,  People say you can learn about a persons character by playing golf with them. The same is true about traveling together, especially under challenging conditions. It wasnt like dodging bullets in Bosnia, mind you, but sharing close quarters with Secret Service snipers provides its own sort of bonding tension. , More to the point, observing Laura Bush navigate the uber-mans world of the Middle East - putting kings and sheikhs at ease while lifting terrified women from despair by her reassuring presence - was inspiring. Mrs. Bush didnt get as much recognition for her efforts on this side of the world as she deserved, but seeking such attention was never her point. , And now comes Jeb. , Though Ive not met him, I formed an impression about Jeb Bush during the 2012 Republican Convention in Tampa, Fla. , when I heard him speak at a small reception. Predisposed neither to like nor dislike him, I was immediately impressed. Without notes, he was eloquent, thoughtful, fluent in policy yet plainspoken, accessible and utterly free of artifice or guile. I remember thinking at the time: If the American people could hear him, they would like him. , They finally got to hear him Monday as he launched his presidential campaign. Well soon know whether my instincts were right. As to the dynasty question, Bush settled the issue, indirectly and cleverly: \"The presidency,\" he said, \"shouldnt be passed on from one liberal to the next.\" , Classy.

Theyre using their offices to enrich themselves and their clients, often at the expense of Texas citizens. , In the past decade, public officials have been involved in more than a dozen major scandals and controversies - paybacks to political donors, conflicts of interest and the revolving doors between the public and private sectors. When you add up all the money lost in kickbacks, bungled contracts and sheer bad management, the cost to taxpayers is colossal - more than $1 billion. , Corruption has reached such immense proportions that Gov. Greg Abbott declared ethics reform an \"emergency\" issue for the 2015 legislative session. With only a week left, the Legislature has yet to pass a significant reform bill. But theres still time. , Need ethics reform, This week, the House will debate the Senates ethics omnibus bill, SB 19. This legislation could bring the first major political reform in 20 years and relief for Texans from one of the highest corruption taxes in the nation. But the House must strengthen the bill. What emerges this week must go much further than the Senates package - legislation that House State Affairs Chairman Byron Cook described as a \"one of the most superficial efforts Ive ever seen with respect to an attempt to address ethics.\", Years of dirty politics during former Gov. Rick Perrys tenure has generated a laissez faire attitude toward even astonishing scandals. His Texas Enterprise Fund doled out $222 million to entities that did not submit formal applications or were not required to create jobs, according to the state auditor. Under Perrys administration, the state had to fire the firm it contracted for $899 million to use call centers to determine eligibility for benefits such as Medicaid, according to media reports. The firm failed to generate the savings it promised or address mounting backlogs. , Twenty-one percent of Perrys campaign donations came from people who became his appointees. Parks and Wildlife commissioners gave Perry an average of $118,477 each. Texas A&M University Regents, one of Perrys largest sources of cash, averaged $113,127. That ought to be a crime. , Campaign dark money - contributed by organizations that are not required to disclose the identity of the people or corporations that provide the funds - has continued to proliferate. Dark money contributions rose to over $2 million in Texas 2014 election cycle. Voters dont know who or what is backing the people running for high office. Even legislators say dark money has reached frightening levels. , Shut the revolving door, When corruption is this big, it takes a big bill to confront it. , SB 19 currently makes limited headway toward clarifying public officials financial interests, which would help expose conflicts of interest when public policy is being shaped. The bill also requires that public officials financial statements be posted electronically in an accessible, searchable format, so people can see them without having to drive to Austin to do so. It requires public officials to identify all sources of income, earned and unearned, and disclose compensation for legal referrals. All of that is good. , But when the bill emerges from the House, it needs to do much more or it will dash any hope for real reform. It needs to shut all of the revolving doors between government and the private sector. For example, it should prohibit legislators from doing any work for state agencies for two years after they leave office. Similarly, it should prohibit public servants involved in awarding contracts to companies from working for those businesses for two years. , To illuminate dark money, the bill should require identification of all sources of funds used for election campaigns. This principle should apply to direct expenditures by for-profit and nonprofit organizations designed to influence elections. , We dont often have the opportunity for real reform. Now is one of those moments. But unless Texas citizens make a concerted and collective demand for reform by calling their legislators, it wont happen. Corruption will be swept under the rug, once again. Constituents must ask the people they elected to shut the revolving doors, end pay-to-play politics and shine a floodlight on dark money.

{"Content": "[ In 25 states, lawmakers are considering state constitutional amendments banning gay marriage. In seven more, opponents of gay marriage are gathering signatures to place the issue on the November ballot that also will include the presidential election. , Most of the same states already have laws against gay marriage, separate from language in their constitutions. Texas law bans gay marriage. Its lawmakers, however, have not moved to encode the ban into the state constitution or put the issue on the ballot. , In the U.S. Senate, Republicans announced plans Friday to seek a vote on a federal constitutional marriage ban July 12, two weeks before the Democratic National Convention in Boston, where the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled this year that gays have a right to wed. , \"I think when the American people get a chance to have their voice heard that they will overwhelmingly reaffirm their commitment to traditional marriage,\"said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, a leading advocate for the amendment. , Making the marriage ban a high priority could help President Bush and other Republicans in close races come November by energizing voters who support the marriage restriction. , In February, Bush called for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage after the Massachusetts court ruled and San Francisco issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples. , Steven Fisher, communications director for the Human Rights Campaign, a national gay rights advocacy group, said the issue has become mired in the politics of the presidential contest. , \"The proponents of this started off claiming their objective was protecting marriage, but the timing of this shows its just a political effort and the veil of protecting marriage is tattering,\" Fisher said. \"This is about Republicans turning out their base, its all about politics.\", The vote could force Senate Democrats to choose sides between the majority of voters, who are shown in various polls as opposing gay marriage, and the more liberal elements of their own party who endorse gay marriage. , After July action in the Senate, voters in Missouri, a campaign battleground state, will consider the issue on the August primary ballot. , Petitions being circulated in other states where the presidential election is closest, including Ohio, Oregon, Michigan and Arkansas, would place the issue on the November general election ballot. They call for amending the states constitutions to ban same-sex marriage. , Speaking this week to the Southern Baptist Convention, Bush reiterated his support for a federal amendment. , \"My administration is defending the sanctity of marriage against activist courts and local officials who want to redefine marriage forever,\" Bush said. , \"The union of a man and woman is the most enduring human institution, honored and encouraged in all cultures and by every religious faith. And government, by strengthening and protecting marriage, serves the interests of all,\" Bush said. , But, while most Americans do not support legalizing gay marriage, Americans tend to split evenly on whether a constitutional amendment is necessary, according to surveys. , Senate proponents of the gay marriage ban said Friday that their actions are not aimed at winning the fall election but are necessary because circumstances forced them to act. , \"I think at first many people were sort of in shock when they first saw the images of same-sex couples being married in San Francisco and then in Massachusetts, thinking this could not be. And then they were more or less in denial,\" Cornyn said. \"I think that sort of describes even some of our colleagues, thinking that maybe this matter would just go away. \", Sen. John Kerry, the Democratic presidential contender from Boston, is against legalizing gay marriage. Even so, Kerry campaign manager Mary Beth Cahill criticized Bush and his Senate backers for using the issue to drum up political support. , \"The U.S. Constitution is one of our nations most enduring and sacred symbols and shouldnt be politicized by the president or his surrogates,\" Cahill said of the call for a July 12 vote in the Senate. \"The only thing this plan will do is continue the presidents efforts to further divide an already-divided nation.\", While it is an enduring, emotional issue for many, gay marriage is not one that historically divides the two parties. President Clinton in 1996 signed the Defense of Marriage Act, defining marriage as between heterosexuals. With that model, 39 states have passed similar laws. , Democratic pollster Celinda Lake said voters believe there are more important issues at the moment, notably the war in Iraq and the economy at home. , \"I think a lot of voters are going to conclude that this is a political ploy and we need to get back to real issues,\" Lake said. , Some social conservatives see the pending vote in the Senate as a test that forces politicians to take a stand on the issue. , \"We look forward to seeing which senators will step up to the plate and take a stand in defense of marriage next month,\" said Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council. \"We have heard from many senators who have declined to co-sponsor the (amendment) but have privately said they will still vote for it. It will be interesting to see if they keep their word.\", A proposed constitutional amendment becomes law if it is approved by two-thirds majorities in the Senate and House and by the legislatures of at least 38 states.]", "Date": "20040619", "Title": "[GOP making gay marriage major election issue]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/GOP-making-gay-marriage-major-election-issue-1627877.php", "Author": "[JULIE MASON, Copyright 2004 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau]"}
{"Content": "[ In a landmark shift in U.S.-Cuban relations toward cooperation and the restoration of diplomatic ties, President Barack Obama has changed the face of diplomacy and ideological politics in the Western Hemisphere. , Of course, the main takeaways from the speech are indeed Cuba-specific. Washington will establish an embassy in Havana for the first time since 1961. Cold War-era security policy will be revised with the goal of removing Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism. Travel, commerce and telecommunications restrictions will be eased dramatically. , A closer listen to Obamas speech, however, also reveals some of the most progressive changes to U.S. policy in Latin America since FDRs noninterventionist Good Neighbor policy, which dissolved under Cold War tensions and fear of communist proliferation in the region. With this speech, the Western Hemispheres equivalent of the Berlin Wall has begun to crumble, propelling U.S.-Latin American relations into the 21st century. , Nod to Monroe Doctrine coercion, The shift in U.S. policy on Cuba - until today, an entrenched symbol of ideological differences in the region - sends a strong signal across the hemisphere that the U.S. is indeed ready for \"renewed leadership in the Americas.\" Obama revealed that Cuba will send its first-ever representative to the 2015 Summit of the Americas, which will also now host members of civil society. For years, the absence of Cuba at the summit, largely at the insistence of the U.S. , has frustrated other heads of state, thus hindering multilateral diplomacy. , In addition to denouncing communism, drug cartels, dictators and fraudulent elections, Obamas remarks take a stab at colonialism and recognize the common Latin American perception of the U.S. as a regional colonizer. Between the lines here, Obama - albeit lightly - acknowledges Washingtons long habit of coercion in the region under the Monroe Doctrine. He envisions that \"a future of greater peace, security and democratic development is possible if we work together - not to maintain power, not to secure vested interest, but instead to advance the dreams of our citizens.\" These comments, although relatively vague next to the concrete actions taken on Cuba, are a step in the right direction for mutual prosperity and respect among all countries in the Western Hemisphere. , Accepting democraphic realities, On the home front, improved foreign relations with Cuba and Latin America have a direct impact on the lives of many U.S. citizens and residents, especially those with Latin American roots. Obama mentions Miamis proximity to Havana and the thousands of Cubans who fled to the United States under the Castro regime. Today, Miamis diversity continues to grow, attracting immigrants from Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil, adding to the increasingly visible Latin American diaspora across the country, as weve seen in Houston as well. , With this in mind, Obama indirectly embraces the United States as an integral part of a region often thought of as culturally distinct. He does not shy away from demographic realities, and paints Miami with its moniker - \"the capital of Latin America\" - as \"a profoundly American city - a place that reminds us that ideals matter more than the color of our skin, or the circumstances of our birth; a demonstration of what the Cuban people can achieve, and the openness of the United States to our family to the South.\", Obamas rhetoric and executive decisions unfortunately fall short of lifting the embargo. That remains up to Congress. The events of the week nonetheless represent a historic beginning to the end of an era for the sake of a more united Western Hemisphere.

With a premonitory insight, Franklin answered, \"A republic, if you can keep it.\", At that stage, the republic did not extend the franchise to either enslaved people or women. Perfecting the union to grant full rights to all its members remained a task for the future that continues today. , As Franklin envisioned, history served up severe challenges to the rights of citizens that the new Constitution enshrined. Times of crisis produced periodic lapses. It took the suffragette movement to earn women the vote, while their struggle for full economic equality continues. Although the Civil War resulted in the abolition of slavery, the subsequent disenfranchisement of freed blacks in the South would require a civil rights movement a century later to counter racial discrimination. , The internment of loyal Japanese-American citizens on the West Coast during World War II was eventually seen as an illegal abrogation of their rights, and the post-9/11 erosion of hallowed judicial procedures such as habeas corpus and prohibitions against indefinite detainment and torture will likely be regarded in a similar light by future generations. , Throughout it all, events have shown that the genius of our system lies in its ability to change course from those lapses and steer the ship of state back to the framework of law upon which it was launched. That process seems to once more be under way. , Although Thanksgiving celebrations across the country this year are shadowed by stormy economic skies and continuing military conflicts and terror threats abroad, the mostly concluded national election has once again demonstrated both the good sense of the American voter and a commitment by both the winners and losers to the peaceful transition of power and a devotion to the common good. , The gracious concession speech by Republican presidential candidate John McCain and the open-handed pledge of support by President George W. Bush for the transition to his successor, Barack Obama, epitomize and renew the sacred commitment to constitutional process. , Likewise, the measured first steps of President-elect Obama, including picking chief party rival Hillary Clinton as secretary of State and current Bush Secretary of Defense Robert Gates as a holdover, promise a government of experience, bipartisanship and proven expertise. With nearly two months until he is sworn into office, Obama has already created an aura for his future administration of much-needed reassurance, competence and conciliation. , One of the most encouraging reports to come out of the transition camp, according to The Washington Post, is a plan to remove the Federal Emergency Management Agency from the Department of Homeland Security and give it a higher priority, perhaps under former highly regarded Clinton-era FEMA administrator James Lee Witt. , Given its poor performance during recent hurricane emergencies, that would be a change for which all Texas coastal residents could give thanks.]", "Date": "20081127", "Title": "[Hope in the air: Americans can give thanks for an enduring democracy that keeps faith with its Constitution]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/editorials/article/Hope-in-the-air-Americans-can-give-thanks-for-an-1767384.php", "Author": "[Copyright 2008 Houston Chronicle]"}
{"Content": "[ Its pretty basic: You have to be a citizen of this country to vote, right? Not necessarily. , A movement is growing in New York City to grant the vote in local elections to legal immigrants. And the debate is growing loud enough to become a major issue in the citys next mayoral election. , The right to vote in a presidential election is not on the wish list: New York proponents say immigrants just want a voice on local issues ranging from sewer improvements to public school construction for everyone who pays local taxes. , A similar movement is percolating on the West Coast. Immigrant groups in San Francisco are researching how they could change state and local law to allow non-citizen parents to vote in local school board elections. , There is nothing in the U.S. Constitution that bans non-citizen voting. Those decisions are made by the states, and some allow it. , While Texas has large and diverse immigrant populations concentrated in cities like Houston and Dallas, immigrant activists say \"alien suffrage\" is an issue that doesnt draw much support in the southwestern states, perhaps because of the concerns about large numbers of illegal immigrants living in the region. , A Texas legislator introduced a bill in 1995 to allow local communities to decide whether non-citizens could vote in their elections. It never made it out of committee. , Until a backlash against immigrants began to swell at the beginning of the 20th century, more than 2 dozen states, including Texas, allowed non-citizens to vote. , But in New York City, a change of state law would add approximately 1 million legal immigrants to the list of eligible voters, a potentially powerful voting bloc. Its not unprecedented. When many large urban school districts were decentralized in the late 1960s, parents who were not citizens were allowed to vote in school board elections in Chicago and New York. , Immigrant parents in New York lost that voice two years ago when the city dismantled the school boards. , A handful of suburban towns in Maryland allows non-citizens to vote in local elections, and the mayor of Washington, D.C. , would like to open the vote to legal immigrants in his citys elections. Opponents say granting voting rights to non-citizens devalues the concept of citizenship. , \"Theres nothing in the Constitution to prohibit extending the vote to anybody,\" said Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. \"But that doesnt mean its a good idea.\", FAIR advocates reducing legal immigration and stopping illegal immigration. Steins group has long complained that the so-called \"Motor Voter\" law, which makes applying for a voters registration card nearly automatic for anyone applying for a drivers license, has sent countless numbers of non-citizens to the polls anyway, with only an honor system about citizenship standing in the way. , \"Its always interesting. The genesis of these proposals seems to be there are people on the city council who see a lot of people in their communities who would probably vote for them but arent citizens,\" Stein said. \"Thats a heck of a reason to dilute the concept of citizenship.\", A variety of immigrant groups and a few labor-related organizations are backing the idea in New York, but they are not united on the details. Some want voting rights for all legal immigrants; some want rights only for those who are pursuing citizenship. , New Yorks Republican mayor, Michael Bloomberg, is against the measure, while City Council speaker Gifford Miller, a Democrat and potential mayoral candidate, indicated hes leaning toward supporting the idea. , Margaret Fung, director of the Asian-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, said the issue will become important in the municipal elections. At a basic level, immigrant parents just want to get back the voice they had when they were allowed to vote in school board elections, she said. , \"It was the one spot where Asian turnout was generally higher than the general population,\" Fung said. , Jamin Raskin, professor of constitutional law at American University, led the \"Share the Vote\" campaign in Marylands Takoma Park in 1992, getting the right to vote in local elections for the small communitys immigrant population, mostly Salvadoran and Guatemalan refugees. , New Yorks vast non-citizen population needs to get similar access to the polls, Raskin said, to get the voice it deserves. , \"This is a way to make people who are politically invisible today visible tomorrow,\" Raskin said. \"Mayor Bloomberg, who has spoken of his openness to immigrants, has raised peoples expectations, and now many New Yorkers will follow through on his political rhetoric even if he does not.\", Granting the right to vote to Takoma Parks non-citizens has not made much of an impact on local elections. In 2003, out of 9,832 registered voters, the city reports, only 494 were non-citizens and 14 of those actually voted in the last election, according to the city secretary. , It was unclear how the votes by non-citizens were identified. , In states like California and Texas, Hispanic activist groups are more focused on getting Latino voters already eligible to register and show up at the polls. , \"We are a formidable force as it is, with just those citizens that are eligible to vote,\" said Victor Landa, regional director for the Southwest Voter Education Project in San Antonio. \"If we could just tap into that, it would be outstanding. Im not really sure if those residents awaiting citizenship would be more eager voters -- whos to say?\", Allowing non-citizens to vote on local issues makes sense, Landa said. , \"But I dont know if Texas is ready for something like that. Hopefully we could debate it,\" he added. , The Texas Election Code required voters to be U.S. citizens as of 1921.

{"Content": "[ JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP)  Voters next year will pick more than a new governor  the election likely will either ensure Missouri becomes the 26th right-to-work state or remains a holdout in the national push for the measure despite being surrounded mostly by states that have adopted it. , Thats because despite having what should be veto-proof Republican majorities in both the House and Senate, the bill didnt pass this week. While enough lawmakers supported the measure in order to send it to Democratic Gov. Jay Nixons desk, they fell 13 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to override his veto. , Opponents ranging from Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton to local unions praised Nixon, as well as lawmakers who voted against it, after the measure failed. , \"On behalf of working women and men in Missouri, I want to thank Governor Nixon for vetoing Right To Work,\" Missouri AFL-CIO President Mike Louis said in a statement. , The measures failure in Missouri, Republican House Speaker Todd Richardson said, isnt a reflection on momentum for the national push for its passage. Richardson said the proposal has seen perhaps unexpected support in states such as Indiana, Wisconsin and even Michigan  the headquarters of the United Auto Workers. , The three Midwestern states have enacted right to work in recent years, but with the support of Republican governors. , Nixon is the difference in Missouri. , \"Im proud of how far weve been able to take the issue despite not having a governor who supports the policy,\" Richardson said. , Richardson isnt the only supporter who has pointed to Nixon as a major  or primary  reason for the bills failure, and that adds pressure to next years election. A change in power could also mean a change in the fate of right to work. , \"This is why this election matters,\" said former state House speaker and U.S. attorney Catherine Hanaway, a Republican running for governor in 2016, in a statement sent to supporters after the House vote. \"We must elect a governor who will sign right to work.\", Republican Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder, a longtime right-to-work supporter who is running for governor, also distributed a public letter the day after the bills failure, vowing to continue the fight. , \"This is no time for retreat,\" Kinder wrote. \"Forward, then: onward to ultimate victory on right to work for Missouri.\", Hanaway, Kinder and three other potential or announced Republican candidates signed a letter this past week in support of right to work, and a state senator also running for the job voted in favor of the measure in May. , That likely means Missouri will be a right-to-work state if a Republican is elected to succeed Nixon. , Attorney General Chris Koster, the only Democrat running for governor, criticized the measure in a pitch for donations for his campaign the day after the House vote. , \"I hope youll help build this organization so we can get a few more votes in each precinct, a few more votes in each county, and a few more votes in each district,\" the emailed request read. \"Thats how well change Jefferson City  with men and women who put Missouris families first.\", Unless enough of the Republican opponents from strong-union districts who voted against the bill in the House are ousted during the 2016 elections, electing Koster likely will ensure Missouri remains a right-to-work holdout. , ", "Date": "20150919", "Title": "[Missouri governor's race to determine fate of right to work]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/article/Missouri-governor-s-race-to-determine-fate-of-6516081.php", "Author": "[Summer Ballentine, Associated Press]"}

{"Content": "[ Larry Downing/Reuters, The videos, even to one of Planned Parenthoods most ardent supporters, are disturbing. , Tenof them have trickled out, one by one, since July. Each of the undercover videos, released as part of a \"sting\" operation byananti-abortion group called the Center for Medical Progress, has arguably provoked a more intense reaction than the last. , Someshow executives and associates affiliated with the family-planning and womens health organization discussing the use of aborted fetuses for research. Another features a technician from a company that had partnered with Planned Parenthood and purchased aborted fetus parts recalling a moment in which she witnessed a fetus heart \"beating\" on an operating table. , \"I would encourage every American to watch the videos,\" presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said in Wednesdays second Republican presidential debate on CNN. , The issue has galvanized conservatives, like Cruz, into some of their most persistentactivism on the issue of abortion in some time. Conservatives accuse Planned Parenthood of harvesting and selling fetal body parts. Planned Parenthood has mounted a vehement public defense, insisting it has donenothing wrong and accusing its opponents of exaggerating claims in a years-long effort to derail the organization. , Now, many Republicans  including a handful of presidential contenders  are pushing to cut off federal funding for the organization. Democrats and President Barack Obama defend the organization, pointing out that it provides an array of health services for women and that federal moneyfor Planned Parenthooddoesntfundabortion. , However, defunding Planned Parenthood comes with a big catch: Funding for the organization is being tied to the legislative vehiclethat will keep the government from shutting down at the end of the month. Therein lies the debate within the Republican Party since its leaders desperately want to avoid a shutdown, given the damage to the partys brand from a 17-day shutdown two years ago. , A good chunk of the Republican Partys rank and file still wants to de-fund the organization at all costs  even if it means a shutdown. Force President Barack Obamas hand, they argue, and make him veto the legislation that would simultaneously defund Planned Parenthood and prevent a government shutdown. That way the shutdown would be his fault. , Time is of the essence; lawmakers are only scheduled to be in session for a handful of more days before the end of the month. , There are several moving parts at play. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), with a bigger Republican majority in the House ever before in his tenure, is also facing perhaps the most angst among his conservative base. There are whispers that conservatives could try to remove Boehner from his post as speaker if he stands intheir way on Planned Parenthood. , Larry Downing/Reuters, The intraparty feud has also spilled into the GOPpresidential race. Though every candidate agrees Planned Parenthood should be de-funded, there is broad disagreement on a strategy. And severalprominent presidential candidates are backing up the GOPs rank and file. , Former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina drew perhaps the debates most raucous applause Wednesday nightfor her answer on Planned Parenthood. Her comments came as the squabble was on full display. , Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R), who served in Congress for nearly two decades, said any Republican attempt to de-fund the organization would be fruitless. Fiorina disagreed. , \"I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama to watch these tapes. Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain,\" she said. \"This is about the character of our nation, and if we will not stand up in and force President Obama to veto this bill, shame on us.\", Fiorinas comments were later ruled \"misleading\" by multiple fact checkers.The scene she described never explicitly happened in any of the videos. (In one video, a technician describes another technician calling herover to see a fetus with a still-beating heart. There was no indication its brain was about to be removed, as The New York Times noted.), The fact that her comments were misleading didnt stop her from getting the biggest applause of the night. , \"Carly Fiorina just won the Planned Parenthood exchange, even stealing Ted Cruzs thunder,\" said Erick Erickson, a prominent conservative activist and the editor in chief of the conservative website RedState. , Larry Downing/Reuters, Depending on whom you ask and what you read, youll see two distinct sides and opinions that form over the significance of the videos, what they show, and what should be done about them. At the heart of the issue is a key ethical question:, Should the remains of aborted fetuses be used for medical research?, To the Center for Medical Progress, which has revealed 12 conversations between an undercover agent and officials or associates of Planned Parenthood in the 10 videos, the seriesreveals the \"barbaric abortion practice\" Planned Parenthood employs. , The Center, which opposes abortion, had undercover actors pose as buyers for companies that procure fetal tissue for medical researchers.The videos include, for example, secretly recorded lunches with Planned Parenthood executives. The actors also traveled to either Planned Parenthood clinics themselves or clinics where companies had partnered with the organization. , The CMP accuses Planned Parenthood of \"harvesting\" and selling body parts from \"living, fully-formed fetuses,\" and they allege the videos show such discussions taking place. Planned Parenthood denies \"selling\" fetal body parts and says it is acting within the law, only charging researchers enough to cover the costs of maintaining and transporting the fetal body parts. , \"A lot of people are realizing that the out-of-sight, out-of-mind mantra about their barbaric abortion practice that propelled Planned Parenthood for so long is now forever gone,\" David Daleiden, the founder of the CMP, told Business Insider. , \"The PR spin of their highly-paid executives and political consultants falls flat compared to the frank admissions of their top-level Medical Directors that they use illegal partial-birth abortion procedures to harvest body parts from living, fully-formed fetuses.\", Planned Parenthood Federation of America President Cecile Richards has apologized for the \"tone\" of at least one of her staff that appears in one of the videos. But the organization has mounted a proactive public defense against the CMP, accusing it of \"deceptive editing\" of the videos and attacking the character of Daleiden and others who have formed the CMP. , Planned Parenthoods latest forceful defense came Thursday, when its executive vice president accused Fiorina of lying. , \"I am writing to tell you directly that your claims are completely false and that the video footage you described simply does not exist,\" wrote Dawn Laguens in a letter published on Medium.\"Literally, there is no such scene on any of the heavily edited, widely discredited videos that have been released by anti-abortion extremists.\", Larry Downing/Reuters, But the videos do contain several moments that have raised controversy. Even Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, who has defended Planned Parenthood in the wake of the assault, has called some elements of them\"disturbing.\", In the first video, for example, Deborah Nucatola, the senior director of medical services for Planned Parenthood, appears to suggest that some doctors will alter procedures when performing abortions if they know a potential buyer is interested in tissue remains. , In a subsequent video, Dr. Mary Gatter, the president of the Planned Parenthood Medical Directors Council, discusseswith the CMP actors price ranges for \"intact tissue.\", Heres a partial transcript of their conversation:, GATTER: I dont want to play games. I just dont want to low-ball. , CMP actor: You know what? If you low-ball, Ill act pleasantly surprised, and youll know its a low-ball. What I want to know is, what would work for you?, GATTER: $75 a specimen. , CMP ACTOR: Oh. Thats way too low. And really, thats way too low. I want to keep you happy. , GATTER: I was going to say $50. Ive been places that did $50, too. But see, we dont, were not in it for the money. We dont want to be in the position of being accused of selling tissue and stuff like that. On the other hand there are costs associated with the use of our space. , The release of the videos, which first emerged in late July, spawned the immediate trigger of congressional investigations. Before it left for a month-long recess, the Senate voted on a bill to de-fund Planned Parenthood.It failed, as Senate Democrats blocked it from advancing beyond a procedural hurdle. , Meanwhile, conservatives were ramping up the charge to attach Planned Parenthood funding to the vehicle to keep the government funded. , Larry Downing/Reuters, The star in this congressional drama, once again, is Ted Cruz. , The firebrand freshman senator, who joined forces with a group of House conservatives to push federal government intoa 2013 shutdown over the Affordable Care Act, is again leading Republicans down a path toward shutdown. , \"Absolutely we shouldnt be sending $500 million of taxpayer money to funding an ongoing criminal enterprise, and Ill tell you, the fact that Republican leadership in both houses has begun this discussion by preemptively surrendering to Barack Obama and saying, Wellgive in because Obama threatens a veto,\" Cruz said Wednesday night. , \"You know, Obamas committed to his principles. His liberal principles, he will fight for them. He says, I will veto any budget that doesnt fund Planned Parenthood, and Republicans surrender. We need to stop surrendering and start standingfor our principles.\", It looks, sometimes frame for frame, like a replay of the 2013 shutdown fight. At least 28 House Republicans have said they will not vote for a government-funding bill that does not de-fund Planned Parenthood, right around the limit of defections Boehner can afford to pass a bill with only Democratic support. Theyre being urged on by the conservative base, as well as the Center for Medical Progress. , \"Americans are outraged at the fraudulent way Planned Parenthood holds itself out as a mainstream health care provider while trafficking in baby parts. All of our elected representatives should commit to holding Planned Parenthood accountable for its crimes,\" Daleiden, the founder of the CMP told Business Insider. , It comes as Boehner faces perhaps the most passionate challenge to his speakership. Both of the Republicans who represent viable alternatives to Boehner as speaker  House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-California) and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin), the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, said this weekthey back Boehner. , But there is no end game yet for the House. And in the end, Boehner might face an all-too-recurring dilemma. Should he try to pass a bill with Democratic support and risk a real challenge to his leadership, or plunge the government into a self-inflicted wound?, \"A variety of options under consideration, no decisions at this point,\" a House leadership aide told Business Insider. , Another Republican aide, when asked how the fight will end, responded to Business Insider with a \"\\\\_()_/,\" an emoticon, commonly referred to as a \"shruggie,\" that signals a shrug. , Larry Downing/Reuters, In the Senate, meanwhile, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) has been insistent that he will not allow a replay of 2013s shutdown. He has prominent lieutenants  including Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-New Hampshire), who is up for re-election in 2016. , Ayotte sent a letter to Cruz on Thursday that challenged him to explain how a funding fight ends with Republicans coming out on top. She bitingly saidshe opposes a shutdown, \"particularly when it appears there is no chance of achieving a successful result.\", Ayotte pointed to the fact that Republicans could only muster 53 votes to de-fund Planned Parenthood in August. With 60 votes needed to advance any bill beyond a key procedural hurdle, Ayotte questioned how Cruz sees Republicans getting to that number  let alone 67 votes in the certain event of a presidential veto. , \"During the last government shutdown, I repeatedly asked you what your strategy for success was when we did not have the votes to achieve the goal of de-funding Obamacare, but I did not receive an answer,\" Ayotte wrote. \"I am again asking this question and would appreciate you sharing your strategy for success with all of us before any damaging government shutdown becomes imminent.\", For their part, Democrats and the White House appear unified. , House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-California) and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada) met with Obama at the White House on Thursday for about 90 minutes. Reid said they agreed to support a short-term bill to keep the government funded for a matter of months, as long as spending for domestic and defense priorities are increased at equal levels. , One Senate Democratic aide guessed an end result: After Republicans are unable to garner enough support for a continuing-resolution to keep the government funded that also de-funds Planned Parenthood, McConnell would bring forward a \"clean\" bill with no such Planned Parenthood rider. , But whether the House would follow up by supporting such legislation is still unclear. And it would only punt the shutdown debate to later in the year, in the thick of the Republican presidential primary. , \"Republicans are better punters than Shane Lechler,\" the Democratic aide said, referring to the legendary NFL punter. , Join the conversation about this story , NOW WATCH: Fashion designer Nicole Miller reveals what Donald Trump is really like, See Also:, SEE ALSO:Carly Fiorina just gave an answer thats making conservatives go crazy]", "Date": "20150920", "Title": "[A lot of Republicans want to shut down the government over 10 'undercover' videos]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/technology/businessinsider/article/A-controversial-video-is-roiling-the-abortion-6391312.php", "Author": "[Brett LoGiurato, provided by]"}
{"Content": "[ Let the sparring begin. , Houstons mayoral candidates duked it out at Tuesday nights unusually lively mayoral forum, in which candidates had the opportunity to both debate a series of broad-ranging topics and quiz each other. , The events different format highlighted the races emerging political fault lines, most of which revolve around the citys looming budget deficit. Issues of the hour included if and when to lift the citys revenue cap, whether to close the fiscal gap by issuing new debt, and what to do about thecontroversial streets and drainage initiative known as ReBuild Houston. , At nights end, City Councilman Stephen Costello was the self-declared \"piata,\" having fielded a host of questions about ReBuild Houston, which was his brainchild, and received four of the seven questions that candidates posed to each other. , Costello and former Kemah Mayor Bill King, both of whom bill themselves as moderate fiscal conservatives, are thought to be in a battle for Houstons right-leaning voters  a well-represented demographic at the forum, which was hosted by the United Republicans of Harris County. , The first question of the forum addressed whether to amend the citys revenue cap in light of Houstons looming $126 million deficit. Of the seven candidates in attendance, only former City Councilman Chris Bell and state Rep. Sylvester Turner proposed changes, with Bell calling for the cap to be repealed and Turner suggesting the city make exceptions for either public safety or to pay down city debt. , The next question, on ReBuild, set up each of the candidates to criticize the execution of ReBuild Houston, if not pan it entirely. , That left Costello alone singing the programs praises. , Other questions posed by the moderator, KHOUs Doug Miller, touched on the Houston Police Departments best chiefs in the last 36 years and use of devices called Stingrays to collect cell phone data, as well as the citys pensions and permitting processes. , Garcia fumbled his answer to Millers query about HPDs best chiefs when he named Fred Bankston, who was deputy chief. , Miller also offered candidates an opportunity to list the top three items on their to-do lists, should they replace term-limited Mayor Annise Parker. , Turner named infrastructure, financial management and transportation, while Bell decided to go a more specific route, listing as his top priorities zero-based budgeting, getting new trucks to fill potholes and implementing a new system to collect data on city services. , Costello, Hall and Kings responses were similar to Turners, with all three naming slight variations of public safety, infrastructure and financial management or pension reform. King also used the opportunity to take another jab at ReBuild Houston. , Businessman Marty McVey said he would create an office of economic development office, which the city already has, though McVey clarified that his would be \"actually a real economic development office.\" He also listed tackling the budget and reorganizing the structure of city departments. , Garcia named just two specific items  financial reform and public safety before generalizing that his priorities would be to \"lead, manage and reform.\", Sparks didnt really begin to fly until the second half of the event, when each candidate had the chance to ask one other candidate a question. 2013 mayoral runner-up Ben Hall and businessman Marty McVey asked Costello about ReBuild, while King pressed him on fiscal discipline and former Harris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia lobbed him a softball on improving the citys permitting process. , Halls attack on Costello was particularly pointed, and he accused Costello of obscuring how ReBuild Houstons funds would be used. , Costello reiterated that he thinks ReBuild is \"a good program,\" citing a series of accomplishments and discussing the sources of revenue that flow to the citys streets and drainage renewal fund. , Hall did not back down, responding, \"its wrong to mislead voters.\", (At nights end, Miller dubbed Costello \"Stephen Rocky Balboa Costello.\"), Meanwhile, Costello went head-to-head with King on how King would fund the pensions of legacy members through his proposed defined-contribution model. , When Turners chance at bat came around, he tried to inject some humor into the increasingly tense room, asking, \"Can we all get along?\", \"Steve, I love you, I really do. I do love you,\" Turner continued to much laughter, before turning to question Kings proposal to fund infrastructure projects through bond elections. , \"I have no problem with borrowing money for building long-term assets,\" King responded. \"Bond elections is the way we built infrastructure for 180 years. There was no reason to change what we were doing.\", Turner then criticized King for his support of issuing new bonds. , \"I agree with you that ReBuild Houston certainly can be better run,\" Turner said to King. \"You are going to, in a sense, bankrupt the city and put it on future generations to pay for increased debt. That is not a conservative philosophy.\", Garcia was the only other mayoral hopeful to receive a candidate question. , Bell inquired about when Garcia initially found out that a mentally ill inmate was being held in squalid conditions in the Harris County Jail, under his watch. , Garcia did not directly answer whether his former chief deputy had indeed told him about the case a year before it became public last fall, saying instead, \"when I found out about this issue, I took action.\"]", "Date": "20150715", "Title": "[Mayoral candidates spar in Republican hosted forum]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/politics/election/local/article/Mayoral-candidates-spar-in-Republican-forum-6385193.php", "Author": "[By Rebecca Elliott]"}
{"Content": "[ LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP)  A Kentucky county clerk has appealed a judges decision to put her in jail for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. , Attorneys for Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis officially appealed the ruling to the 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Sunday. The three page motion does not include arguments as to why Davis should be released but amends Davis earlier appeal of the judges order. , Davis objects to same-sex marriage for religious reasons and stopped issuing all marriage licenses in June after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage nationwide. Two gay couples and two straight couples sued her. U.S. District Judge David Bunning ordered Davis to issue the licenses and the Supreme Court upheld his ruling. , But Davis still refused to do it, saying she could not betray her conscience. , Thursday, Bunning ruled Davis was in contempt of court for disobeying his order and sent her to jail. Her deputy clerks then issued marriage licenses to gay couples Friday with Davis behind bars. , \"Civil rights are civil rights and they are not subject to belief,\" said James Yates, who got a marriage license on Friday after having been denied five times previously. , Mat Staver, one of Davis attorneys, said the marriage licenses issued Friday are \"not worth the paper they are written on\" because Davis refused to authorize them. But Rowan County Attorney Cecil Watkins says the licenses are valid. Bunning said he did not know if the licenses were valid but ordered them issued anyway. , Bunning indicated Davis will be in jail at least a week. She could stay longer if she continues to not obey the judges order. Bunning had offered to release Davis from jail if she promised not to interfere with her deputy clerks as they issued the licenses. But Davis refused. , Staver called the contempt hearing \"a charade\" saying that Bunning had his mind made up before the hearing began. , Kentucky law requires marriage licenses be issued under the authority of the elected county clerk. Davis views issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples as a stamp of approval of something she believes is a sin. She has said she will not issue marriage licenses until the state legislature changes the law so the licenses can be issued under someone elses authority. , The state legislature is not scheduled to meet again until January and Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear has refused to call a special session. Davis has refused to resign her $80,000-a-year job. As an elected official the only way she could lose her job is to lose an election or have the state legislature impeach her, which is unlikely given the conservative nature of the state General Assembly. , \"Shes not going to resign, shes not going to sacrifice her conscience, so shes doing what Martin Luther King Jr. wrote about in his Letter from the Birmingham Jail, which is to pay the consequences for her decision,\" Staver said. , Davis plight has reignited the gay marriage debate and the limits of religious freedom. Her imprisonment has inspired spirited protests from both sides in this small eastern Kentucky community known mostly as the home to Morehead State University. , Saturday, about 300 people rallied in support of Davis at the Carter County Detention Center where she is being held.

{"Content": "[ LINCOLN, Neb. (AP)  A host of new laws took effect Sunday in Nebraska, leading to changes ranging from costlier marriage licenses to expanded opportunities for nonviolent prisoners to be released for parole and probation. , The 181 laws took effect three months after the end of this years legislative session, the normal grace period for measure approved by lawmakers. , Following a vote  and veto override  by legislators, Sunday also would have marked the end of capital punishment in Nebraska, but death penalty supporters announced last week they had gathered enough signatures to place a measure blocking the death penalty repeal on the ballot and stop the change from taking effect before the November 2016 election. , Here are some of the new laws now in effect:, MARRIAGE LICENSE FEES, Getting married in Nebraska will now cost an extra $10. The new law increases marriage license fees from $15 to $25, while certified copies will rise from $5 to $9. , Nebraska counties lobbied for the increase, arguing the previous fee did not cover the costs of filing licenses and verifying the information. The original proposal would have raised the fee to $50, but conservative lawmakers balked at the idea. The law is LB88. , The law will generate an estimated $28,000 a year for Lancaster County, covering expenses that otherwise would have been paid through property tax revenue, said County Clerk Dan Nolte. Nolte said processing roughly 2,000 licenses each year and ensuring theyre accurate takes more effort than people realize. , \"Its an important legal document, and we want to make sure things are the way they need to be,\" Nolte said. , UNDERAGE DRINKERS, Underage drinkers who seek medical help for themselves or a friend because of alcohol poisoning will receive legal immunity from alcohol charges in some situations. The law is designed to encourage underage drinkers to seek medical attention when someones life is at risk without having to fear a criminal conviction. The law is LB439. , \"We need to accept the reality that drinking occurs in a college environment, and we need to educate on how to be safe, responsible and look out for one another,\" said Thien Chau, the University of Nebraska-Lincolns student body president. , NURSE PRACTITIONERS, Nurse practitioners now have more independence under a law removing a requirement that they get a written agreement to consult with a doctor before they can practice. The so-called integrated practice agreements are designed to ensure a physician is available for collaboration or referral, but nurse practitioners say theyre extensively trained and could help ease the states health care shortage. The Nebraska Medical Association opposed the law, citing patient safety concerns. The law is LB107. , NATIVE AMERICAN CHILDREN, Native American children who are at risk of being removed from their homes will have new protections that make it harder to separate them from their families and break cultural ties. The new law makes clear exactly when a social worker can remove a child, and requires that custodial preference be given to a foster home or adoptive parents who can preserve a childs relationship with his or her tribe. The law is LB566. , PRISON CROWDING AND SENTENCING, Nebraskas prison population could start to decline under a new law that increases the use of probation for nonviolent offenders, increases parole opportunities and requires supervised release for felony offenders before they complete their sentences. Another law going into effect Sunday will increase the Legislatures oversight of the state prison system by creating a new inspector general positon. The laws are LB605 and LB598. , DIRECT DEMOCRACY, Organizers of Nebraska petition drives can once again pay circulators by the signature rather than by the hour, making it easier to place issues on the ballot. The law overturns a 2008 ban on signature-based pay. Critics of the ban say many grassroots groups dont have the resources to pay circulators hourly. The law is LB367. , TRIAL EVIDENCE, Wrongly convicted Nebraska prisoners will have more chances to demonstrate their innocence. The law will give prisoners up to five years, instead of the current three, to seek a new trial based on newly discovered, non-DNA evidence. It also would allow judges to order DNA testing on evidence that wasnt previously examined, or where new technology could lead to more accurate or probative results. The law is LB245. , BRAND INSPECTION FEES, The cost of brand inspections for cattle could rise to as much as $1.10 per head. The Nebraska Brand Committee now has the authority to charge a higher maximum fee to cover its expenses. , The Brand Committee hasnt decided whether to increase the fees, but the new law will give its members more flexibility, said Executive Director Shawn Harvey. Harvey said the committee is working with outdated computers and needs to offer higher salaries to attract more inspectors. , \"In the last three or four years, its been difficult to get qualified applicants to apply for our openings,\" Harvey said. , The fee ceiling was last increased in 2005, from 65 cents to 75 cents per head.

(AP)  A former member of the Little Rock School Board said Wednesday shes running for a U.S. House seat in central Arkansas, the first Democrat to launch a congressional bid in the state for 2016. , Dianne Curry said she was running for the partys nomination to challenge Republican Rep. French Hill in the 2nd Congressional District. Hill was elected in November and is seeking a second term in the House. , \"I feel that I have the ability and I have had the ambition for a long time to move forward,\" Curry told The Associated Press. \"For me, this is an opportune time to move forward and represent the people of my community.\", Curry is launching her bid months after Republicans swept statewide and congressional offices. The GOP has made major gains in the state primarily by tying Democrats to President Barack Obama, who remains deeply unpopular in Arkansas. , Curry said shell detail her campaign proposals in the coming months but that she wants to focus on health, education, jobs and the economy. , She said she would have voted for the federal health care law if she had been in Congress when it was approved in 2010. Hill and the rest of the states all-GOP congressional delegation have repeatedly called for the laws repeal. , \"There is some tweaking that needs to be done,\" said Curry, who declined to specify what changes shed like in the law. , Curry, 61, was first elected to the Little Rock School Board in 2006 and served through earlier this year, when the state took over the district and dissolved the board. Hill, a former banking executive, defeated Democratic rival and former North Little Rock Mayor Pat Hays for the 2nd District seat. , Hill last month reported having nearly $375,000 in the bank for his re-election bid.

{"Content": "[ METULA, Israel - If I were a political novelist, Id try to write a novel about Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel. , The story would be partly Nixonian. Netanyahu is surpassingly brilliant, as even his opponents here concede. He knows the minute guts of Israeli politics and has read deeply into big history and grand strategy. He is also said to be suspicious, solitary and insular. It is hard to stay on good terms with him, whether you are on his staff or his nations closest ally. , The story would be partly Kennedyesque. The Netanyahu clan was presided over by Benjamins brilliant father, Benzion, the great medieval historian. The eldest brother, Jonathan, was the golden child. When Jonathan died in the raid on Entebbe in 1976, hopes shifted to Benjamin, who is known as Bibi. Political analysts have spent decades psychoanalyzing the family dynamic, with mixed results, but a novelist who studied Sophocles or Tolstoy might be able to make some sense of it. , The story would be partly Churchillian. Netanyahu sees himself in world historical terms and admires Theodor Herzl and Winston Churchill - two men who saw dangers ahead of other people. Netanyahu obviously lacks many of Churchills qualities, like playful charm, but he has a profound nationalist passion and a consuming historical consciousness. , Like Churchill, he is wisest when things are going wrong. He has been a pessimist about the Arab world. As the Arab Spring has deteriorated, as Palestinian democracy led to Hamas, as run-of-the-mill extremists have lost ground to the Islamic State, Bibis instincts have basically been proved correct. , The story would be part Shakespearean. Nearly every political leader has one close friend or spouse, often female, who is widely hated. People cant blame the leader for slights, so they blame her. In Israel, the role is played by Netanyahus wife, Sara, who has been the subject of fascination and scorn for decades: She is often described as Lady Macbeth. Few know her exact role, but, it is said, she exiles the disloyal, shapes his politics, mistreats servants and distracts him when he is supposed to be running the country. Obviously, any novel about Netanyahu and modern Israel would have to be told from her vantage point. The narrative voice would be electric. , The story would be part \"Citizen Kane.\" Netanyahu rose to fame via CNN. His rise and survival are intertwined with changes in media, with the decline of old newspapers that are generally hostile, and the rise of new cable networks and outlets that are often his allies. Ferociously tending his image, his wars with his foes in the Israeli press have been epic. , Finally, the story would be part Machiavelli. The great Renaissance philosopher argued that it is best to be both loved and feared, but if you have to choose one, it is better to be feared. Netanyahu is not loved, especially by those in his party. But he is feared and acknowledged, the way any large, effective object is feared and respected. , Im visiting Israel for the 18th or 19th time (my son is currently a member of the Lone Soldiers Program, which allows people from around the world to serve in the Israeli military). I asked a couple of smart Israelis what their coming elections are about. They said the elections are about one thing: What do you think of Netanyahu? Such is the outsized role he plays in the consciousness of this nation. , No one has a simple view of him. To some, he is a monster who has expanded the settlements on the West Bank, which are a moral stain and do calamitous damage to Israels efforts to win support around the world. To some, he is the necessary man in hard times, the vigilant guardian as the rest of the Middle East goes berserk. , Both viewpoints have some truth. To me, his caution is most fascinating. For all his soaring rhetoric and bellicosity, he has been a defensive leader. He seems to understand that, in his countrys situation, the lows are lower than the highs are high. The costs of a mistake are bigger than the benefits of an accomplishment. So he is loath to take risks. He doesnt do some smart things, like improve life for Palestinians on the West Bank, but he doesnt do unpredictable dumb things, like prematurely bomb Iran. He talks everything through, and his decisions shift and flip as the discussions evolve. , If you think trends in the Middle East will doom Israel unless it acts, then this defensiveness is a disaster. If you think, as I do, that Israel has to wait out the current spasm of Islamist radicalism, then this caution has its uses. , Israeli voters havent warmed to Netanyahu over the past quarter-century. But they have come to think more like him, accepting that this conflict will endure, digging in for a dogged struggle. For good and ill, he has refashioned the national mind. , , Brooks is a New York Times columnist.]", "Date": "20150103", "Title": "[Brooks: Netanyahu: Monster or Israel's guardian?]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Brooks-Netanyahu-Monster-or-Israel-s-guardian-5992057.php", "Author": "[By David Brooks]"}

{"Content": "[ Not on anyones mind? For years, immigration has been the subject of near-constant, often bitter argument within the GOP. But it is true that Trump has brought the debate to a new place - first, with his announcement speech, about whether Mexican migrants are really rapists, and now with the somewhat more nuanced Trump plan. , Much of it - visa tracking, E-Verify, withholding funds from sanctuary cities - predates Trump. Even building the Great Wall is not particularly new. (I, for one, have been advocating that in this space since 2006.) Dominating the discussion, however, are his two policy innovations: (a) abolition of birthright citizenship and (b) mass deportation. , Birthright citizenship, If you are born in the United States, you are an American citizen. So says the 14th Amendment. Barring some esoteric and radically new jurisprudence, abolition would require amending the Constitution. Which would take years and great political effort. And make the GOP anathema to Hispanic-Americans for a generation. , And for what? Birthright citizenship is a symptom, not a cause. If you regain control of the border, the number of birthright babies fades to insignificance. The time and energy it would take to amend the Constitution are far more usefully deployed securing the border. , Moreover, the real issue is not the birthright babies themselves, but the chain migration that follows. It turns one baby into an imported village. , Chain migration, however, is not a constitutional right. Its a result of statutes and regulations. These can be readily changed. That should be the focus, not a quixotic constitutional battle. , Mass deportation, Last Sunday, Trump told NBCs Chuck Todd that all illegal immigrants must leave the country. Although once theyve been kicked out, we will let \"the good ones\" back in. , On its own terms, this is crackpot. Wouldnt you save a lot just on Mayflower moving costs if you chose the \"good ones\" first - before sending SWAT teams to turn families out of their homes, loading them on buses and dumping them on the other side of the Rio Grande?, Less frivolously, it is estimated by the conservative American Action Forum that mass deportation would take about 20 years and cost about $500 billion for all the police, judges, lawyers and enforcement agents - and bus drivers! - needed to expel 11 million people. , This would all be merely ridiculous if it werent morally obscene. Forcibly evict 11 million people from their homes? It cant happen. It shouldnt happen. And, of course, it wont ever happen. But because its the view of the Republican front-runner, every other candidate is now required to react. So instead of debating border security, guest-worker programs and sanctuary cities - where Republicans are on firm moral and political ground - they are forced into a debate about a repulsive fantasy. , Which, for the Republican Party, is also political poison. Mitt Romney lost the Hispanic vote by 44 points and he was advocating only self-deportation. Now the party is discussing forced deportation. , It is not just Hispanics who will be alienated. Romney lost the Asian vote, too. By 47 points. And many nonminorities will be offended by the idea of rounding up 11 million people, the vast majority of whom are law-abiding members of their communities. , Donald Trump has every right to advance his ideas. He is not to be begrudged his masterly showmanship, his relentless candor or his polling success. I strongly oppose the idea of ostracizing anyone from the GOP or the conservative movement. On whose authority? Let the people decide. , But that is not to say that he should be exempt from normal scrutiny or from consideration of the effect of his candidacy on conservatisms future. If you are a conservative alarmed at the countrys direction and committed to retaking the White House, you should be concerned about what the Democrats presumptive candidate is flailing badly. , Republicans have an unusually talented field with a good chance of winning back the presidency. Do they reallywant to be dragged into the swamps - right now, on immigration - that will make that prospect electorally impossible?, Yes, I understand.

{"Content": "[ ONAWA, Iowa (AP)  Scott Walkers suggestion that building a wall between Canada and the U.S. might be a \"legitimate\" idea prompted swift derision from fellow Republicans on Monday and an attempt by his campaign to clarify what he meant. , It was the latest misstep for a 2016 presidential candidate who got off to a strong start but has fallen back into the pack after a series of fumbles and a lackluster performance in the first GOP debate. , The Wisconsin governor was asked on NBCs \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday whether he thought a wall should be built along the more than 5,000 miles of border with Canada. , \"Some people have asked us about that in New Hampshire,\" he said. \"They raised some very legitimate concerns, including some law enforcement folks that brought that up to me at one of our town hall meetings about a week and a half ago.  So that is a legitimate issue for us to look at.\", Walkers campaign spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said Monday his comments were being misunderstood. , \"Despite the attempts of some to put words in his mouth, Gov. Walker wasnt advocating for a wall along our northern border,\" Strong said. She said he meant that border security was a legitimate issue. , But the fact he appeared to entertain the notion of a northern wall brought a swift response. , \"Thats a pretty dumb idea,\" Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a 2016 rival, told Boston Herald Radio. \"There have been a lot of dumb ideas put out. One, that the Mexicans will pay for a wall, was probably the dumbest of dumb ideas. But putting a wall up between us and Canada is sort of a ridiculous notion.\" Donald Trump has proposed pressure tactics to persuade Mexico to pay for a wall along its border with the U.S. , Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist who leads the Right to Rise political action committee supporting Jeb Bush, said on Twitter that Walker was distracted by \"his plan\" to build a wall along the Canadian border. , Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy from the border state of Vermont piled on, too. , \"Terrible idea,\" he said. \"Election season always brings out crazy ideas, but this is one of the craziest.\", The latest struggle for Walker comes after hes had to backtrack and clarify his positions on immigration and terrorism, reassure jittery donors after his performance in the first GOP debate and reshape his campaign to try to rekindle the spark he showed months ago, when he quickly climbed into the top tier of candidates after impressing Iowans in a January appearance. , Thats meant trying to get back to basics in Iowa, where hes aiming to visit all 99 counties. , \"A lot changes between now and the caucuses,\" he said last week after a two-day tour. \"I think the most important thing we can do is get out and tell our story.\", In his latest swing, he pitched himself as the only Republican who has fought and won without compromising his core conservative principles. , He also outlined his foreign policy goals, criticized President Barack Obama and Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton as \"leading from behind\" and called for a state visit with the Chinese president to be canceled. , Yet in the past 10 days, Walker also changed his stance three times on whether he, like Trump, favored doing away with the constitutional right to citizenship granted to people born in the U.S. Walker finally said he had no position on the issue and would not seek repeal of the 14th Amendment that provides that right. , In New Hampshire, Walker also said recently there were only a \"handful\" of moderate followers of Islam  a religion followed by more than a billion people worldwide.

{"Content": "[ Over the past decade, Brazil was poised to rid itself of the moniker, \"country of the future.\" Former President Luiz Incio \"Lula\" da Silva found creative ways to encourage parents to keep their kids in school and get their inoculations. He used the military to break up armed gangs in the notorious favelas. , The giant national oil company, Petrobras, used its proprietary technology to unlock the vast \"pre-salt\" oil reserves in the deep water offshore. (Traditional seismic processes could not identify reservoirs because the salt broke up signals.), But on a recent weekend, hundreds of thousands of Brazilians took to the streets to protest corruption, a declining economy and high inflation and demand the ouster of President Dilma Rousseff. Earlier this month, Moodys downgraded Petrobras shares two steps to junk status. , I have followed Petrobras since I was a young banker at Texas Commerce Bank in the late 1970s, when we supported our Texas-based clients operating in Brazil. Twenty years later, as director of international government relations at Royal Dutch Shell, I witnessed a period of openness when international companies were welcomed back to Brazil and could elect to operate independently or with Petrobras as partner. , Times have changed. Rousseff recently replaced the president of Petrobras in response to a corruption scandal. Billions of dollars reportedly were kicked back to politicians in her coalition government through inflated contracts between contractors and Petrobras. Although she has not been accused personally of corruption, Rousseff was chair of the Petrobras board from 2003-2010, when the scheme mushroomed. , Critics question why Petrobras paid nearly $1 billion for the Pasadena  refinery it purchased part of in 2006 - even though it had been sold two years earlier for less than $43 million. , Nationalist politicians became increasingly skeptical of Petrobras after it issued a limited percentage of its shares in global capital markets to fund development. They feared that demands of investors would interfere with government goals. , So the government created an unwieldy hybrid. A new bureaucracy, Agncia Nacional do Petrleo (ANP), was superimposed to represent the states interests and make key decisions. Petrobras would be the operator for all pre-salt development. Multinational oil companies like ExxonMobil and Chevron would have to accept Petrobras as operator, even though complex offshore operations are their own key strength. , This structure is dysfunctional. It breeds organizational confusion, enables corruption and places too heavy a burden on Petrobras, while minimizing the contribution that international companies can make. , In October 2013, only one bid was presented at the auction for offshore licenses - it was at the minimum price and minimum local content. There was no licensing round in 2014, and there is talk of deferring a planned auction in the first half of 2015. , Foreign investors must use local companies for the bulk of their equipment and service purchases, so-called local-content requirements. While not unusual in the energy industry, Brazils are among the steepest in the world. For the 12th licensing round, the average local content commitment was 70 percent for exploration and 85 percent for development phases. Brazilian engineering and construction firms had a lock on the process, with limited competition from outside the country. It probably wasnt difficult for some executives at Petrobras, the construction companies and politicians to find a mechanism to inflate contracts and privately share the excess. , Brazil, saddled with massive amounts of debt, inflation, deferred oil production and endemic corruption, faces current low oil prices from a position of weakness. Rousseff needs to undertake fundamental reforms. Here are four suggestions:, Adopt the model of a country like Colombia that successfully restructured its energy system and the role of its national oil company. A single agency sets policy, negotiates competitive contracts and monitors operations, but doesnt make operational decisions. , Establish a transparent system in which qualified local and international companies compete with Petrobras for contracts and operatorship on an equal footing. , Change the local content laws to get the best products and services through international competitive bidding. , Reconsider a host of other regulatory and legal deterrents, such as labor laws, to see if they really serve to develop human resources in Brazil, or actually prevent workers from becoming internationally competitive. Rousseffs \"Workers Party\" owes it to them. , Brazil can regain its momentum and fund its serious social and infrastructure challenges. It doesnt always have to be \"the country of the future.\", , Arnold is a professor in the practice of energy management at Rice Universitys Jones Graduate School of Business.

{"Content": "[ PETERBOROUGH, N.H. (AP)  Even at his own rallies, Republican presidential candidate John Kasich is a stranger to some New Hampshire voters. , Karen Bednarski, who packed into one of the Ohio governors three New Hampshire appearances this week, says she learned about his presidential bid for the first time \"within the last week.\", \"What Ive heard I like,\" Bednarski, a 48-year-old Republican-leaning independent from Peterborough, said just before Kasich walked into the room. , It may not matter that many in the audience didnt know how to pronounce his name (its KAY-sik), didnt remember his 18 years in Congress and hadnt heard about his overwhelming re-election last year in one of the nations premiere swing states. Even as a mystery, Kasich has emerged as a legitimate threat to his better-known Republican rivals  former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in particular  whose presidential aspirations are focused on New Hampshire. , \"Ive always been underestimated,\" Kasich said, describing himself as \"the little engine that keeps saying that it can.\", Kasich is among a handful of Republican White House hopefuls betting they can capitalize on the first-in-the-nation primary states tendency to favor pragmatic leaders over party ideologues. Beyond Kasich and Bush, its a group that includes New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former New York Gov. George Pataki and perhaps Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, whose libertarian leanings resonate in the state whose official motto is \"live free or die.\", It is a powerful collection of candidates targeting the same slice of the electorate among a larger field of 17 major Republican contenders. Coming off a strong performance in the first GOP debate, however, Kasich has shown signs of momentum. And Bushs team has taken notice. , On policy, tone and political strategy, Kasich and Bush draw from a remarkably similar political playbook. Both men made New Hampshire their first stop immediately after announcing their presidential campaigns and after the recent presidential debate, although the straight-talking Kasich doesnt pretend hes as well-known as his rivals. , \"One of the things that frustrates me is that you dont know me,\" he told the audience at a Peterborough town hall-style meeting on Tuesday, the first of three public appearances over three days of campaigning. , It was Kasichs 11th trip to the state this year, said Kasich spokesman Chris Schrimpf; hes scheduled to make his 12th next week. , Bush is set to return to New Hampshire next week for his 11th appearance since March alone. , \"Our approach from the start is were going to be low to the ground and were going to take Jeb everywhere,\" said Rich Killion, a senior adviser to Bush in New Hampshire. , Kasich has just four paid staffers in the state compared to Jebs seven. Yet Kasich has recently acquired two well-respected surrogates volunteering on his behalf: former Sen. John E. Sununu and former state Attorney General Tom Rath. , \"I think Jeb is a very strong candidate here,\" said Rath, a former adviser to Bushs older brother, former President George W. Bush. \"The difference is its a stronger field. Right now, nobodys got control of this playing surface.\", The parallels between Kasich and Bush are undeniable. , In sharp contrast to many conservatives, both men speak warmly of immigrants in the country illegally. While Bush says such immigrants came out of an \"act of love,\" Kasich said this week they \"contribute significantly\" to the nation. , \"A lot of these people who are here are some of the hardest-working, God-fearing family-oriented people you can ever meet,\" he said. , Kasich and Bush are also among the few candidates in the race who support the Common Core education standards, a policy they defend as helpful for states to seeking to establish higher standards. The standards are vehemently opposed by many conservative Republicans. , Both favor sending additional ground troops to combat the Islamic State group. Like Bush, Kasich wont say how many troops might be necessary beyond the 3,500 American military trainers and advisers already helping Iraqi forces. Asked how long U.S. forces should be willing to stay in the region, Kasich said, \"As long as it takes to get the job done.\", The pair also shares a similar tone, embracing an optimistic campaign message when compared to rivals such as Paul and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, whose candidacies are defined as much by what theyre against as what theyre for. Kasich has taken his positive message to the next level, however, by refusing to attack his competitors in either party. , \"If youre suggesting that personal attacks are off limits, I agree with you,\" he told a voter this past week, adding that issue-oriented debates are fair. \"I wont attack Hillary personally,\" a reference to Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton. , After his first New Hampshire appearance, Bednarski said she was impressed by Kasichs straightforward manner and compassionate tone. And once he started talking, she said, she remembered his role in budget negotiations with President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. , \"I never thought Id say this,\" Bednarski said, \"but I may sign up to help him.

{"Content": "[ RALEIGH, N.C. (AP)  North Carolina legislators are considering whether to move all primary elections next year to March, not just the presidential primaries, key House and Senate leaders said Wednesday. , Primaries for state races including those for governor, Congress and the legislature  are currently set for next May 3. A shift to one date, if agreed to, could save several million dollars for taxpayers by eliminating the need for two statewide primaries but also force potential candidates for dozens of jobs to accelerate their decision-making and fundraising. For example, at least four Democrats now are weighing a bid to challenge Republican U.S. Sen. Richard Burr. , A bill brokered by North Carolina Republican leaders this summer and already approved by the Senate would set March 15 as the presidential primary date. The House and Senate will now negotiate the scheduling issues after the House unanimously voted not to accept the Senate bill Wednesday. , Rep. David Lewis, a Republican National Committee member, and Sen. Bob Rucho said lawmakers are discussing several other election changes, some of them technical and sought by the State Board of Elections. But they also said separately that holding only one primary in March also was being examined. , \"Both chambers are considering options that streamline the primary process,\" Lewis, R-Harnett, wrote in an email. Lewis and Rucho emphasized that both chambers still support the March 15 presidential primary. Its a \"widely supported, bipartisan measure that will reflect the important role North Carolina plays in electing\" the president, Lewis added. , The cost of statewide elections is largely borne by the counties, which spent at least $9.5 million on last Novembers general elections, including the early voting period, according to the State Board of Elections. The cost of a statewide primary election wouldnt be much different because all precincts must be opened in all 100 counties, said Josh Lawson, the boards attorney. , Rucho, R-Mecklenburg, said a lot of unknowns about holding two primaries need to be addressed. The last time North Carolina held a separate presidential primary was in 1988. , \"Its up for discussion. Nobody has a real answer for this,\" Rucho said in an interview. \"Weve never done this before.\", Republican leaders decided in 2013 to separate and move up the presidential primary so voters in the nations ninth most populous state could have more influence on choosing nominees. , The 2013 law would set North Carolinas presidential primary in February, but the Republican National Committee threatened to take away most of the states 2016 convention delegates if the primary was held that early. National Democrats also have similar rules discouraging February primaries.

Terror groups use zero-cost social media to find new adherents, he said. , Burr said he wasnt suggesting that thousands of U.S. armed forces be sent to fight the terror groups, but rather that trust must be rebuilt among U.S. allies in the region surrounding places such as Syria and Iraq, where the Islamic State is strong. , \"Lets prosecute the war against terrorism, and lets leverage not just the Kurds but everybody in the Middle East that has the potential for boots on the ground and change the landscape,\" he said. , Burr, a Winston-Salem Republican seeking re-election in 2016, praised the FBI for the agencys efforts nationwide to halt potential homeland terror attacks, including those in North Carolina. , Intelligence agencies now face a greater obstacle in monitoring potential terrorist activities after congressional action two months ago, according to Burr. , He opposed provisions in the USA Freedom Act approved in June that prevent the National Security Agency from collecting and storing phone records. Soon the government will have to get court orders to obtain information from phone companies on specific phone numbers that could be linked to terror activities. , \"We had that debate in Washington. I lost,\" Burr said. \"And now our intelligence community no longer has the tool.\" He said the U.S. and its allies have a limited amount of time before technology used by terrorists becomes so advanced that their potential actions cant be tracked through electronic data. , On other topics, Burr said:,  the U.S. economy still is slow to recover from the Great Recession. He said corporate tax reform and strong commitments to protecting intellectual property and continuing the rule of law is a sure recipe to increase economic growth. ,  a great asset of North Carolinas economy is the number of college graduates it produces annually, which Burr said is second only to California. He said those graduates provide a ready-made workforce that will attract companies to North Carolina. ,  he wouldnt \"engage\" in his Senate re-election bid as a candidate until Congress recesses next summer or even later in the early fall.

Richard Burr in 2016. , After other conventional high-profile picks again said no, another crop of potential candidates are now seriously considering getting in, among them current and former state legislators and a small-town mayor. Those lack the broad name recognition compared to Hagan, who lost her Senate seat to Republican Thom Tillis nine months ago. , Each day without an active rival to Burr, whose campaign had nearly $4 million in the bank in July, raises questions whether Democrats are truly keen on denying him a third term. A largely unknown candidate probably would have to raise at least $10 million for ads to help raise the persons voter familiarity enough. , \"Were getting short in the process for fundraising,\" said Brad Crone, a longtime North Carolina Democratic consultant. \"The big fear is that as we come into Labor Day, Democrats have really got to put a push on to find a candidate just to be able to compete.\", Democrats expressing interest last week were Spring Lake Mayor Chris Rey, former state Rep.

Shuler said in a statement hes enjoying his job at Duke Energy  hes a lobbyist  \"and that is my focus.\", Hall, an attorney in his second House term, said he would most likely file federal candidacy papers in the coming week but suggested it didnt mean he was fully committed yet. , \"Obviously, Im looking to see who else gets in,\" Hall said in an interview. He believes hes got a good chance of attracting independent and moderate voters, and highlights his ability to pass legislation in the Republican-led General Assembly. , A former lobbyist for the state American Civil Liberties Union, Ross served in the Legislature for 10 years and now works for Triangle Transit. She was known for her outspokenness on womens rights and liberal-leaning causes but also put her imprint on bipartisan legislation, including a landmark ethics law. , \"People have been very complimentary of my extensive legislative record of getting things done, and not just the things that appear in the newspaper,\" Ross said in an interview. , Rey, head of a Fayetteville-area nonprofit, considers himself as someone who is speaking for people who arent benefiting from actions of the Republican-led Congress and state Legislature. , \"I bring a different kind of voice for the people who are really hurting in North Carolina,\" Rey said. , The three said theyve spoken to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in Washington. The DSCC says Burr is vulnerable due to low approval numbers, his voting record and running in a presidential year in a battleground state. , Hagan, who upset GOP Sen.

Democrats also seem more interested in trying to defeat GOP Gov.

Political analysts say the defeats might lead organizers to retreat in future elections to dense urban areas that are reliably Democratic. , \"It shows it was a waste,\" Richard Murray, a University of Houston political science professor, said of Democrats efforts to increase turnout. , Republicans secured all four county judge posts that were contested in suburban areas,including two with-out an incumbent in the race. , In Brazoria County, Matt Sebesta, Precinct 2 Commissioner of Angleton, coasted to victory over Democrat Robert Pruett, who works as city administrator of Galena Park. The county judge post had long been held by E.J. \"Joe\" King, who  retired. , Waller County Judge Glen Beckendorf, mired in a heated Hempstead debate over a proposed landfill, also announced he would not seek re-election. In that race, Republican Trey Duhon secured the seat rather than Democrat Sylvia Cedillo, a former county commissioner. , Both Fort Bend and Galveston counties did not see a leadership change.

He defeated Democrat Wilvin Carter, a criminal defense attorney who once worked for Healey. Carter represented Healeys first general election challenger. , Obscured in the usual defeats were some promising signs for future Democratic efforts, Murray noted. , In recent years, Democrats have wrapped up early voting behind Republicans in turnout by nearly 20 percent, but this year that gap was cut in half in many suburban counties, Murray said. He attributed the shift to new efforts by Democrats to sign up eligible voters for mail ballots and conduct organizing. , In the days that follow the election, fellow University of Houston political scientist Brandon Rottinghaus said, both parties will be analyzing the age and ethnicity of who cast ballots to better understand who might have an edge in future elections. , He also noted that despite the defeats, which Republicans will be sure to highlight, Democrats likely will say the effects of their efforts were dampened by poor weather and the fact that it was a midterm, not presidential, election year. , \"In Texas, midterm elections hardly break 40 percent turnout,\" Rottinghaus said. \"So it could be a bit skewed, which is why theyll be looking at specific groups.

{"Content": "[ Retail marijuana sales for adults are now legal (at least at the state level) in Colorado and Washington. Next month, voters in Alaska and Oregon may decide to follow suit. It is nearly certain that marijuana legalization will make it onto the California ballot in 2016, during a presidential election season that will generate enormous interest among young voters. It is less certain whether that proposition will succeed; right now, support is above 50 percent, but propositions tend to lose support as election day approaches. Much may depend on how outcomes look in Colorado and Washington next year, and whether Alaska and Oregon build or end the momentum next month. , Ballot propositions are a blunt instrument for policymaking. Activists and their lawyers draft language, and as long as its constitutional, voters get to vote up or down without the give and take that happens (or at least used to happen) in the legislative process. The major legalization propositions thus far (including 2010s failed Proposition 19 initiative in California) are variations on a state tax-and-regulate scheme of commercialization. That may indeed be the best way to legalize marijuana, but no one really knows yet, and it may not be the best option for attracting votes in 2016. In fact, there is a whole menu of options for designing and regulating some form of adult legal access to marijuana, some that have been tried elsewhere. , What should we look for in a marijuana proposal? , There are many conflicting values at stake, including public health and safety, personal liberty and state revenues. The schemes best at promoting personal liberty and public revenues are not the schemes most likely to protect public health and safety. (Just think about marijuana candies.) And the health and safety concerns are real. Current research suggests that marijuana may be safer than you were told when you were young (at least if you are over 40), but also that it is riskier than you may think it is. , So here are five alternatives worth considering, arrayed roughly from lower risk/lower revenues to higher risk/higher revenues:, 1) Decriminalize possession. , Many of the most compelling arguments for reform involve complaints about the corrosive effects of drug-law enforcement. Decriminalizing possession is a no-brainer; it saves money without any serious impact on levels of use. But California is one of the states that already has done this, and voters will have to decide whether its OK that non-medical users still have to break the law to obtain marijuana. , 2) Grow your own. California could simply legalize home cultivation of a small number of plants. This already has been tried in Alaska and in South Australia, and the available evidence suggests that neither community saw increases in marijuana use. Skeptics point to smurfing, in which traffickers scatter their growing operation across many households. But so what? We already have a black market industry, so the perfect shouldnt be the enemy of the good. Home growing takes the profit and the promotion out of marijuana use. , 3) Cannabis co-ops. Since around 2002, Spain has tolerated co-ops of growers and buyers, and there are now several hundred of them. They require membership, and the co-op leaders have an incentive to self-regulate the process so they can stay in operation. It is more of a hassle for consumers than a retail sales outlet, but that may discourage impulse buying and driving under the influence. , 4) Dutch-style cannabis coffee shops. Contrary to popular belief, the Dutch havent legalized marijuana, but they have a written policy of non-enforcement for sales of small quantities in regulated coffee shops. While use did rise when the coffee shops started spreading, it later leveled off once they started closing shops that sold to minors or disrupted neighborhoods. The quasi-legal status of the coffee shop gives the government more control than in a fully legal retail system, and it has kept prices from falling because the government still cracks down on large-scale production. , 5) Tax THC. The biggest risks posed by legalization involve the potential for significant increases in the number of consumers and the amount they consume. Though the United States had more marijuana users in the late 1970s, todays users are consuming more, and more often  which may be why admissions for marijuana treatments are rising in many countries, including the Netherlands. Legalization will probably drive prices down, perhaps dramatically  too low to simply offset with a sin tax that taxes by weight or as a percentage of sale price. But if users are going to smoke more, we can at least discourage them from using the most potent products by taxing by the concentration of the mind-altering ingredient in the cannabis plant, Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and other components. (Users of primo products say they can titrate their dose. Seriously?) Skeptics say it is too difficult to measure THC, but thats not very convincing when High Times magazine offers the same kind of product specs youd find in an issue of Stereophile or Car and Driver Magazine. , Theres a good chance that California will legalize marijuana in the coming years. Whether you like the idea of California legalizing marijuana or you dont, everyone who cares should pay attention to the choices. November 2016 is two years away, but voter propositions start solidifying far sooner, and it will be too late to negotiate the details once one qualifies for the ballot. It is possible that marijuana legalization in Colorado and Washington will prove to be no big deal. Marijuana use was a lot more common in 1979, the historical peak of use, than it is today, so some increase in use is well within our historical experience. But that was milder weed, promoted by black light posters and stoner comedians rather than a major tobacco-like industry. So we have a lot to think about. , Robert MacCoun is a psychologist, a professor of law at Stanford University and senior fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute.

Those concerns arent exactly unfounded  federal authorities have amped up enforcement against the multimillion-dollar, so-called \"birth tourism\" business. , But Republicans are treading a thin line with Latino voters.Republican front-runner Donald Trump, whose focus on combatting illegal immigration has fueled his campaign, has used the term to push an argument that the US should end so-called \"birthright citizenship.\", And onWednesday, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) called for greater enforcement of the border to prevent women from coming to the US, intending to give birth. , Thats [the] legitimate side of this,\" Bush said during a radio interview in New Hampshire. \"Better enforcement so that you dont have these, you know, anchor babies, as theyre described, coming into the country.\", When pressed in New Hampshire on Thursday about whether the term was offensive, Bush refusedto back down. , \"Do you have a better term?\" Bush asked a reporter who questioned his use of the term. \"You give me a better term, and Ill use it.

Anchor babies implies a disdain for a much smaller group of people, and, by the way, one that probably encompasses quite a few non-Hispanic immigrants who in many cases come from richer countries and who are more educated ... who want to give their kids access to the US economy without ever having to deal with our ridiculous and almost unnavigable immigration system as it applies to better educated and skilled prospective immigrants,\" Mair said. , Still, Republicanswho are perceived as being a better bet to win the nomination, however, are treading slightly lighter on immigration issues. , Bush andWisconsin Gov.

They say he is done exploring and is now ready to become the first Republican presidential candidate. , Over the course of the primary campaign, Cruz will aim to raise between $40 million and $50 million, according to advisers, and dominate with the same tea party voters who supported his underdog senate campaign in 2012. But the key to victory, Cruz advisers believe, is to be the second choice of enough voters in the partys libertarian and social conservative wings to cobble together a coalition to defeat the chosen candidate of the Republican establishment. , The firebrand Texan may have few Senate colleagues who will back his White House bid, but his appeal to his partys base who vote disproportionately in Republican primaries could make him competitive in Iowa and beyond. , Yet critics of Cruz argue that he will have trouble raising high-dollar donations from traditional contributors, will land few endorsements from the nations political establishment and be unable to escape comparisons to President Barack Obama, who also ran for president in his first Senate term. And if he advances to a general election, Cruz trails likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton solidly in early public opinion polls. , \"I dont consider him a mainstream candidate, and usually to win youve got to be inside the 45-yard lines,\" said Greg Valliere, a political adviser to Wall Street firms who believes that if Cruz did earn the nomination, he would not win more than a dozen states in the general election. \"The enthusiasm for him will be tremendous in maybe a third of the party, but another third of the party will be strongly opposed and another third of the party will be wary.\", Senior advisers say Cruz will run as an unabashed conservative eager to mobilize like-minded voters who cannot stomach the choice of the \"mushy middle\" that he has ridiculed on the stump over the past two months in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. , \"Ted is exactly where most Republican voters are,\" said Mike Needham, who heads the conservative advocacy group Heritage Action for America. \"Most people go to Washington and get co-opted. And Ted clearly is somebody that hasnt been.\", Upon arriving in Washington, D.C. , Cruz discarded the expectation of deference that accompanies a freshman senator, launching frequent one-man stands to stymie congressional Democrats and Republicans alike. After Cruz led a shutdown of the federal government in October 2013 as part of an effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, conservative activists flocked to their new hero even as Republican leaders excoriated him. , For Cruz, 44, Mondays planned announcement will culminate two years of open musing about running for president that began nearly the moment voters elected him to the Senate in 2012. Only a month later, as senator-elect, Cruz established a political action committee to back conservative candidates nationwide. During his first congressional summer recess, he was already visiting Iowa. , And over the past seven months, the Jobs, Growth and Freedom PAC has added a coterie of nationally experienced political operatives to the 2012 team of Texas strategists who engineered the surprise dethroning of Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst in the Republican primary. Joining the team Monday will be Cruzs wife, Heidi, a managing director at Goldman Sachs in Houston, who will take leave from the firm and accompany her husband on the campaign trail.]", "Date": "20150321", "Title": "[Ted Cruz to announce presidential bid Monday]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/us/article/Ted-Cruz-to-announce-presidential-bid-Monday-6150890.php", "Author": "[By Theodore Schleifer]"}

{"Content": "[ She burned the tapes. , Had Richard Nixon burned his tapes, he would have survived Watergate. Sure, there would have been a major firestorm, but no smoking gun. Hillary Rodham was a young staffer on the House Judiciary Committee investigating Nixon. She saw. She learned. , Today you dont burn tapes. You delete emails. Hillary Clinton deleted 30,000, dismissing their destruction with the brilliantly casual: \"I didnt see any reason to keep them.\" After all, they were private and personal, she assured everyone. , How do we know that? She says so. Were, say, Clinton Foundation contributions considered personal? No one asked. Its unlikely well ever know. We have to trust her. , Will remain private, Thats not easy. Not just because of her history - William Safire wrote in 1996 that \"Americans of all political persuasions are coming to the sad realization that our first lady ... is a congenital liar\" - but because of what she said in her emergency news conference on Tuesday. Among the things she listed as private were \"personal communications from my husband and me.\" Except that, as The Wall Street Journal reported the very same day, Bill Clintons spokesman said the former president has sent exactly two emails in his life, one to John Glenn, the other to U.S. troops in the Adriatic. , Mrs. Clintons other major declaration was that the server containing the emails - owned, controlled and housed by her - \"will remain private.\" Meaning: No one will get near them. , This she learned not from Watergate but from Whitewater. Her husband acquiesced to the appointment of a Whitewater special prosecutor. Hillary objected strenuously. Her fear was that once someone is empowered to search, the searcher can roam freely. In the Clintons case, it led to impeachment because when the Lewinsky scandal broke, the special prosecutor added that to his portfolio. , Answers are farcial, Hillary was determined never to permit another open-ended investigation. Which is why she decided even before being confirmed as secretary of state that only she would control her email. , Her pretense for keeping just a single private email account was \"convenience.\" She doesnt like to carry around two devices. , But two weeks ago she said she now carries two phones and a total of four devices. Moreover, it takes about a minute to create two accounts on one device. Former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood did exactly that. , Her answers are farcical. Everyone knows she kept the email private for purposes of concealment and, above all, control. For other State Department employees, their emails belong to the government. The records officers decide to return to you whats personal. For Hillary Clinton, she decides. , The point of regulations is to ensure government transparency. The point of owning the server is to ensure opacity. Because she holds the emails, all document requests by Congress, by subpoena, by Freedom of Information Act inquiries have ultimately to go through her lawyers, who will stonewall until the end of time - or Election Day 2016, whichever comes first. , Its a smart political calculation. Taking a few weeks of heat now - its only March 2015 - is far less risky than being blown up by some future email discovery. Moreover, around April 1, the Clinton apologists will begin dismissing the whole story as \"old news.\", Damage is done, But even if nothing further is found, the damage is done. After all, what is Hillary running on? Her experience and record, say her supporters. , What record? Shes had three major jobs. Secretary of state: Can you name a single achievement in four years? U.S. senator: Can you name a single achievement in eight years? First lady: her one achievement in eight years? Hillarycare, a shipwreck. , In reality, Hillary Clinton is running on two things: gender and name. Gender is not to be underestimated. It will make her the Democratic nominee. The name is equally valuable. It evokes the warm memory of the golden 1990s, a decade of peace and prosperity during our holiday from history. , Now breaking through, however, is a stark reminder of the underside of that Clinton decade: the chicanery, the sleaze, the dodging, the parsing, the wordplay. Its a dual legacy that Hillary Clinton cannot escape and that will be a permanent drag on her candidacy. , You can feel it. Its a recurrence of an old ailment.

Whatever you do online, though, you will be hard-pressed to learn what the more than half-dozen contenders vying to be the next mayor of Houston think should be done about, say, pensions or infrastructure or economic development. , Five months before voters head to the polls, the candidates digital platforms are up and running, but most are heavy on biography, light on ideas. , \"Theyre checking the box. They have a website, they have a Facebook, they have a Twitter,\" said Luke Marchant, a Houston-based Republican consultant. \"Theyre all doing what they need to do, but no ones really pushing the envelope.\", That is not surprising at this stage of the game, when the hot summer months loom large and politics remain an afterthought for all but the most active voters, political experts said. , Still, with more than a half dozen contenders vying to replace term-limited Mayor Annise Parker, the candidates are missing out on an opportunity to set themselves apart, said Vincent Harris, an Austin-based GOP strategist. , \"How are these candidates differentiating themselves?\" said Harris, who worked on City Council member Oliver Penningtons campaign before he dropped out. \"They have to start differentiating themselves, and policy online is a great way to be doing that.\", Some of the contenders have made small forays into the online policy conversation, with state Rep. Sylvester Turners proposals including a job training program aimed at fixing the citys streets and lifting the existing cap on public arts funding. Among former congressman Chris Bells suggestions are reorganizing the citys public works department, expanding bus rapid transit and housing pre-kindergarten programs in city libraries and community centers. , \"A lot of the effort right now is focused on fundraising, but the people who are donating to campaigns are no different than any other type of voter. They want to know where you stand,\" Bell said, \"and the best place for them to find that information in a quick manner is online.\", Others, namely City Council member Stephen Costello and former mayor of Kemah Bill King introduce themselves on their websites and broadly outline campaign priorities: Costello wants to add to the Houston Police Departments ranks, while King suggests auditing the department and doing away with the citys crime lab. , Former Harris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia and businessman Marty McVey leave it mostly at biography. \"Before Im able to govern effectively, I need to know whats important to the people,\" McVey said, noting that his policy is developing as he talks to potential voters. , Meanwhile, 2013 mayoral runner-up Ben Halls website was down as of Friday afternoon, having previously sported donate and endorse buttons, as well as a countdown clock until election day, but no candidate information whatsoever. Hall said he was refining his policy positions before updating his website. , \"I think you have some top-tier candidates producing some top-tier websites, and others are still struggling to get their websites up and running and online presence secured,\" Marchant said, noting that only a few of the candidates have begun using online advertising to drive traffic to their sites. , That will come in time, most of the campaigns said. As will policy positions. For now, they are concerned with introducing the candidates to potential donors and voters. , \"Its pretty common that you go up with a simple operation at first and then expand it over time in terms of depth of content,\" said Ward Curtin, Costellos campaign manager. , King spokesman Jim McGrath said he expects to roll out more policy information in the late summer or early fall. , \"Its about having the right conversation at the right time,\" he said. \"Timing is important on this.\", Other campaigns, Turner and Garcias included, said they anticipate laying out policy plans in the coming weeks.]", "Date": "20150605", "Title": "[Mayoral candidate websites slow to develop]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/houston/article/Mayoral-candidate-websites-slow-to-develop-6310319.php", "Author": "[By Rebecca Elliott]"}
{"Content": "[ Sometimes it takes a tragedy to get peoples attention. , Januarys terrorist attack on a kosher grocery in Paris triggered a long-overdue discussion about the rise of anti-Semitism in Europe. \"These are the worst times since the Nazi era,\" Dieter Graumann, president of Germanys Central Council of Jews, told The Guardian after a spike in violence against Jews this summer. , The problem can no longer be denied or chalked up to statistical blips. In 2014, some 7,000 French Jews left for Israel, more than double the number who left the previous year. A nonprofit in England reports that from 2013 and 2014 the number of anti-Semitic incidents - violence, property damage, abuse, and threats - more than doubled to 1,168, the most ever recorded. A 2013 European Union survey found that nearly 50 percent of Hungarian Jews had considered emigrating because they felt unsafe. , Anti-Semitism is sometimes viewed as distinct from - and even subordinate to - other human rights issues. Thats a mistake. Anti-Semitism, left unchecked, leads to the persecution of other minorities and an overall increase in repression. It augurs societal breakdown. , Houstonians and other Americans may see this trend as a problem for European Jews or, at most, for Europe. Thats a mistake. The rise of anti-Semitism threatens democratic values and the European Union itself. Europe is our most important ally. That makes it our problem, too. , In France, as in other European countries, a classic fascistic anti-Semitism exists alongside a newer incarnation taking root among marginalized people of Muslim heritage. Its important not to lump all French Muslims together; many are well-integrated into broader French society. , But a sizable, disenfranchised minority remains. Among this population, conspiracy theories about Jewish control of the world tend to resonate, and the line between criticizing Israeli government policies and demonizing Jews often vanishes. While only a fraction of Muslims who hold anti-Semitic beliefs engage in attacks on Jews or Jewish institutions, theres no denying that hatred has contributed to violence. , The resulting rise in anti-Muslim sentiment is a gift to Europes neo-fascists. As Shadi Hamid of the Brookings Institution says: \"Just as Islamist extremists benefit the far right, an emboldened French far right benefits Islamist extremists, allowing them to drive a greater wedge between Muslims and non-Muslims and feed their clash of civilizations narrative.\", Unfortunately, the response of some European governments has been poor. Consider Hungary, where the anti-Semitic Jobbik party won 20 percent of the vote in recent elections. Instead of challenging Jobbik, Prime Minster Victor Orban has coopted important parts of its agenda. As part of a broader slide toward authoritarianism, Orban has trafficked in ethnic nationalism and World War II revisionism. , French officials have spoken out boldly against anti-Semitism. In the wake of the Paris attacks, however, the government is using a new counterterrorism law to restrict speech. Dozens of Muslims have been arrested for speech allegedly in support of terrorism, exacerbating the very divisions on which extremists feed. , Public officials should condemn, not criminalize, hate speech. They should reserve the force of the law for perpetrators of anti-Semitic violence. , Hate crime harms not only its direct victims but entire communities. With a single act of violence, an attacker can terrorize thousands. Indeed, thats often the goal. The U.S. government, a leader in combating hate crime, should share best practices and lend technical assistance. , Governments should also work with Jewish communities to assess their security needs and provide protection. Increased security, however, is no more than a stopgap measure. Leaders must work to create a culture of zero tolerance for anti-Semitism. , Civil society and religious leaders also have a role. No community should stand alone. Targeted minorities and human rights groups share an interest in preventing persecution and exclusion. Leaders should forge coalitions to promote respect for the rights of all. , The Holocaust taught us, or shouldve taught us, about the dangers of complacency in the face of anti-Semitism. Milton Boniuk - a Houston Holocaust Museum board member who sponsors a library of videotaped testimony of Houston-area survivors and benefactor to The Boniuk Institute for the Study and Advancement of Religious Tolerance at Rice University - says that many who would become victims of the Holocaust were in denial. \"They couldnt believe what was happening until it was too late,\" says Boniuk, who himself lost family members in the Holocaust. , Europe is not on the brink of another Holocaust, but the problem is serious. And we know from history that anti-Semitism will keep growing - unless people come together to fight it. , , Elisa Massimino is president and CEO of Human Rights First.]", "Date": "20150326", "Title": "[Massimino: Europe's anti-Semitism can be ignored no more]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Massimino-Europe-s-anti-Semitism-can-be-ignored-6161647.php", "Author": "[By Elisa Massimino]"}
{"Content": "[ Statistics tell a powerful story. Consider that 36 percent of Texas residents age 65 or older depend on Social Security as their only source of income. Or that more than four of 10 in this age group would live in poverty were it not for Social Security. , Then there are people like 72-year-old Raechel Foerster, who paint a face on those numbers. She is one of 3.7 million Texans who could tell their own story of how Social Security makes a difference in their lives. , Foerster lives in the small town of Larue, southeast of Dallas, in a single-wide trailer financed through the USDA Rural Development Corp. For most of her adult life, she worked in department stores, never making more than $8 an hour. Her Social Security payments today allow her to meet her monthly mortgage payments, but she still struggles financially. , \"Without it, Id be on the street panhandling,\" Foerster says. \"I would have to give up my dog, my only companion, who keeps me sane.\", Born in the depths of the Great Depression, Social Security celebrates its 80th anniversary in August and continues to be a pillar of financial security for so many. It isnt only for retirees like Foerster and others who have spent their work lives contributing into the system. Its benefits are also counted on by widows, people on disability and young children who have lost a parent, among others. , To Julia Castellano-Hoyt, an AARP volunteer leader in San Antonio, Social Security survivors benefits have played a key role in her life, both as a child and now as a grandmother. , \"My father died when I still had five siblings in school, in an area where employment was limited,\" she says. \"My mom didnt have the necessary skills for stable employment. If it hadnt been for the survivors benefits, I dont know what my mom would have done.\", Fast forward to today when Castellano-Hoyt and husband, Don, are both receiving Social Security while also being fortunate to have pensions and a bit of savings. Yet they depend on Social Security to make their retirement years work. They also point out to a beloved great grandchild who lost her dad almost two years ago and receives Social Security through her dads survivors benefits. , So do we need to save Social Security? You bet we do,\" Castellano-Hoyt says. , Indeed, Social Security - which enjoys strong support from all parts of the political spectrum - faces challenges that must be addressed to ensure it is strong for the next generation and ones that follow. , The program is currently fully funded until the year 2035 and able to pay only 75 percent of benefits after that. It should be our duty to continue to ensure that people who work hard and pay into the system receive the benefits theyve earned when they retire. , When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the new law on Aug. 14, 1935 - amid criticism from both right and left - he took an historic step that has withstood the test of time. Social Security has benefitted generations and resulted in arguably the most universally popular social program in our nations history. , With 10,000 Americans retiring each day, it is important that we keep this program strong and in sync with how people live today. Any changes should be discussed as part of a broader conversation about how to help Americans prepare for a secure retirement. , The 2016 presidential elections - already in full swing - offer us an excellent opportunity to have a thoughtful, national conversation about this issue and to begin taking action. , Strengthening a program like Social Security, which provides a solid financial foundation that enables people to age with dignity on their own terms, creates a legacy that we can proudly pass along to future generations. , , Bob Jackson is director of AARP Texas. ]", "Date": "20150813", "Title": "[Jackson: Keeping Social Security viable is worthy legacy]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Jackson-Keeping-Social-Security-viable-is-worthy-6443241.php", "Author": "[By Bob Jackson]"}

Religious institutions are exempt. Violators could be fined up to $5,000. , Opponents of the measure submitted a petition seeking to place the law on the ballot for repeal last summer following City Councils 11-6 approval of the ordinance. City Secretary Anna Russell initially counted enough valid signatures to qualify the petition for the ballot, but Mayor Annise Parker and former City Attorney David Feldman threw out many of those because they appeared on pages of the petition they said had not been properly collected or notarized. , Foes sued, leading to a state district judges ruling earlier this year that the petition did not have enough valid signatures. The Texas Supreme Court overrode that in a separate decision last month, ordering the council to repeal the ordinance or place it on the November ballot; the group voted 12-5 to put the law before the public. , Foes have seized on the protections the ordinance extends to transgender residents, specifically the perceived threat of transgender women -- people who were born male but identify as female -- using womens restrooms and locker rooms. They allege \"transvestite men\" may enter womens facilities and commit sexual assaults. , Opponents also accuse Mayor Annise Parker, the first openly gay mayor of a major American city, ofseeking to \"criminalize faith\" byforcing \"individuals, families, churches, schools and businesses to accept, affirm and celebrate the LGBT agenda.\", Supporters on Wednesday indicated they will address both sets of allegations head-on. , Sonia Corrales, chief program officer at the Houston Area Womens Center, said the majority of women and more than 90 percent of children are assaulted by someone known to them, and that similar nondiscrimination laws have been passed in 17 states and 200 cities without accompanying public safety concerns. , \"It is a disservice to the public to continue to perpetuate myths about how and why sexual assault happens,\" she said. \"Nothing in HERO changes the fact that it is illegal to enter a restroom to harm or harass people or invade their privacy.\", Leslie Jackson, a minister at Cathedral of Hope, also decried the \"voices of division\" who \"confuse religious freedom with the freedom to discriminate.\", \"Religious faith does not undermine the value of equality for all under the law,\" he said. \"Religious faith demands it.\", Opponents of the ordinance are hosting their own event Thursday evening, part of the \"Faith, Family and Freedom Tour Across Texas\"that will feature among its speakers former Congressman Tom DeLay, former county GOP chairman Jared Woodfill, Texas Eagle Forums Cathie Adams, and local conservatives Terry Lowry and Dr. Steve Hotze. , \"This is going to be a major battle for the heart and soul of our city,\" a flyer for the event reads. \"Mayor Parker and her liberal allies believe they can take over Houston, then take over Texas.\"]", "Date": "20150812", "Title": "[HERO supporters launch 'Houston Unites' campaign]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/politics/election/local/article/HERO-supporters-launch-Houston-Unites-campaign-6441090.php", "Author": "[By Mike Morris]"}

This is the same court that many GOP legislators had lambasted for the stinging ruling that prompted the rare summer special session. , \"Youre here to fight for what you believe in and I dont think the people anticipate that youre just going to come here and, as its been said, rubber stamp what another persons doing whether theyre in your party or not,\" said House Speaker Steve Crisafulli. , Gov. Rick Scott could call legislators back to work, but a spokeswoman said that he would not intervene in the spat, which led some legislators to call Tallahassee \"dysfunctional\" despite having one-party rule for nearly two decades. , This marks the second time this year that a legislative session fell apart due to sharp disagreements between the House and Senate. Legislators were forced to have a budget special session in June after the regular session ended abruptly due to a fight over health care spending and Medicaid expansion. , The Supreme Court in July ordered legislators to change the boundaries of eight districts, ruling that previous map-drawing efforts violated voter-approved standards that ban drawing up districts to benefit incumbents or a political party. The Legislature was sued by a coalition of groups including the League of Women Voters and Common Cause. The court gave legislators 100 days to draw up new maps in order to have them in place by the 2016 elections. , Legislative staff and lawyers used the courts instructions  which included shifting the seat of U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown to an east-west configuration  to draw up a map that would have altered the states political landscape. It was a map that if adopted could lead to the possible ouster of several incumbents in Congress, including U.S. Reps. Dan Webster and Gwen Graham. , But the Senate pushed to tweak the geography of congressional districts in the Tampa Bay and central Florida region. The biggest change involved the district of U.S. Rep. Dennis Ross, a Lakeland Republican and would have shifted most of it into Hillsborough County. The change was instigated by Sen. Tom Lee who said his goal was to give additional clout to his home county. , House leaders, however, refused to go along with that proposal and suggested the court would question whether the move was done for some parochial interest. Lee has said he had no interest currently in running for Congress. , When House and Senate Republicans held a Friday morning meeting to make a last-ditch effort to work out their differences it ended acrimoniously with the sight of Sen. Bill Galvano leading a contingent of senators out the door while Rep. Jose Oliva was still talking about the proposals. , Galvano, a Bradenton Republican, contended House criticisms of the Senate plan had \"no merit\" legally. He and other senators also argued legislators had a right to have a final say in the map and not relegate everything to attorneys and legislative staff. , \"We really believe very strongly that the legislative branch should be the ones that are drawing these maps,\" said Senate President Andy Gardiner. , Democrats in the minority wasted little time in criticizing Republicans for their failure to pass a new congressional map. They said that the stalemate among legislators shows that the job of drawing new districts should be given over to an independent commission. , \"When egos continue to prevail over the oath each of us took to uphold the constitution, its time to question the master were serving, said Senate Democratic Leader Arthenia Joyner. \"Given the outcome weve seen over this reapportionment process, the answer, sadly, has not always been the people.\", ", "Date": "20150821", "Title": "[Divided Florida Legislature ends session with no new map]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/article/Divided-Florida-Legislature-ends-session-with-no-6457849.php", "Author": "[Gary Fineout and Brendan Farrington, Associated Press]"}

David Jolly, of St. Petersburg, said he would stand up to \"Washington Republicans,\" a group he described as \"go-along, get along, look the other way\" GOP lawmakers. \"Our national debt constitutes the greatest threat to our national security,\" he said. , Jolly defeated Democrat Alex Sink in a high-profile and expensive March 2014 special election after Congressman C.W. Bill Young died in office from cancer. He was re-elected last November in a congressional district that President Barack Obama had won twice. , Florida Lt. Gov Carlos Lopez-Cantera, of Miami, didnt spare anyone in his harsh critique of Obama and Republican-dominated Congress. , \"Washington is not good at getting things done,\" he said in promoting his record with Gov. Rick Scott in reducing unemployment, cutting taxes and building a surplus in the state budget. \"I didnt talk about it_I got it done.\", He lambasted Obamas foreign policy, saying he \"treats our enemies like our friends and our friends like our enemies\" and said he was the \"most effective, most experienced and most electable\" Senate candidate. , Scott picked Lopez-Cantera as lieutenant governor in early 2014 after leaving the post vacant for nearly a year following the forced resignation of Jennifer Carroll. Lopez-Cantera had left the Florida Legislature due to term limits and had won election as property appraiser for Miami-Dade County. , Todd Wilcox, an Orlando businessman and political newcomer, said he offered \"real-world\" experience in a field of GOP Senate candidates who agree on \"95 percent of the issues.\", He hammered Obama on foreign policy and health care, and pledged to reduce the federal governments size and to fight against the Common Core education standards. , \"Government big enough to give you everything you want is big enough to take everything you have,\" said Wilcox, invoking the famous words of Thomas Jefferson. , Wilcox served eight years in the Armys Special Forces as a Green Beret before joining the CIA, and later ran a defense contracting business. , None of the GOP Senate candidates has strong name recognition, according to a recent poll that found a vast majority of respondents in Florida had not heard enough about them to form a favorable or unfavorable opinion.

Under the process that has been proposed for our state, Texans with a current Texas drivers license or Department of Public Safety-issued photo ID could electronically register to vote so long as the license and three other identification measures authenticate them to do so. , Twenty-seven states have adopted online voter registration to save taxpayer money and provide citizen convenience. Oklahoma, New Mexico and Florida passed online voter registration bills in the past month. Arizona has been doing it since 2001 and, as with all the others,  has seen only positive results and major cost savings. , Yet, bills in the Texas Legislature advancing online voter registration remain stalled, even with 76 House members co-sponsoring one of the bills. At a late April House Elections Committee hearing, 89 citizens registered to voice support of two bills. Harris County Tax Assessor-Collector Mike Sullivan led the only contingency testifying in opposition. Supporters include the Harris County Young Democrats, Houston Young Republicans and every statewide organization involved in registering voters.

A 2014 Pew study reports states have not seen any change in the balance of party affiliation of registered voters following the introduction of online voter registration. States also report no security breaches or voter impersonation. The study further finds online registration applications five times more accurate than paper applications. , The three Texas agencies - Secretary of States office, DPS and Department of Information Resources - that would execute online voter registration are confident in their ability. Their representatives testified that registering voters online can work in Texas. , Department of Information Resources Executive Director Todd Kimbriel told the House Elections Committee that the state-contracted Texas.gov vendor processes more than $2 billion in annual payments from taxpayers. Since initiation in 2001, Kimbriel told lawmakers, there have been no security breaches. , An existing Texas.gov platform for voter registration is already in place, used to update residential addresses when a voter moves within a county. To initiate registration online, a person would be required to possess a valid Texas driver license or DPS ID that can only be obtained in person. , More than 60 percent of Texans polled in 2014 favor registering voters online. State Reps. Celia Israel, D-Austin and Carol Alvarado, D-Houston, bill authors, agree its an opportunity to work together to make our voter registration system more efficient, accurate and cost-effective. , The Legislature should consider the widespread successes and the Texas agencies confidence in successful implementation.

{"Content": "[ The right to vote is one of democracys most precious gifts. And protecting that right - by ensuring the integrity of the voter rolls - is one of our public officials highest responsibilities. Thats why the voters of Texas need to know that our voter-registration process works. , And it does work. Look at Harris County. , Voter registration in Harris County is at its highest level ever. As of December 2014, there were 2,058,981 registered voters in Harris County. This is a result of an extraordinary outreach program, a growing population and the hard work of the countys nearly 3,000 well-trained volunteer deputy voter registrars.  , The Voter Registrars office conducted outreach and training sessions for volunteers throughout Harris County to reach out to every corner of the county. County officials work closely with area high schools and community organizations to increase voter registration awareness. Officials work hard to listen to the voters and address their concerns. , State Rep. Celia Israel, D-Austin, recently filed a bill (House Bill 76) to change state law to allow applicants to complete a voter registration application via the Internet. The bill further would require the Secretary of State to develop rules on how to implement the program. Israels bill does not define the procedure. The public has little idea how the new system would work, and no way to assess its integrity. , Proponents of online voter registration point out 20 states currently have such systems in place. But that means that 30 states do not. They also point out cost savings with online registration but cannot accurately identify what those would be in Texas. , There is an assumption that online voter registration would require fewer temporary employees. But county officials work year-round to maintain the voter roll, handling changes of address, name changes, deaths and voluntary cancellations. The office of Voter Registrar handles a high volume of telephone calls and includes personnel who speak four different languages. Which of these employees does Rep. Israel hope to let go?, The current voter registration system in Texas works and works well. Virtually no case has come to light of someone wanting to register within the applicable deadlines and being unable to do so. , Those who wish to register can exercise several options. Eligible citizens may register at the Texas Department of Public Safety, many social service organizations, local libraries, post offices and any of the 16 Harris County Tax Assessor-Collectors branch offices. Potential voters also may print an application from many websites to be completed, signed and mailed. , The Voter Registrars experienced and nonpartisan professionals cross check data to ensure accuracy of each application. Officials code voters for the proper voting precinct, verify the data submitted and mail out a voter certificate. This both protects the registration process and provides new voters with relevant information, including the voters eligible jurisdictions. , During the most recent federal election, the states election management system temporarily shut down on Election Day, almost crippling local voter activity. The Secretary of States office is scheduled to undergo a major software upgrade this year. This is long overdue but full of unknowns. It would be very risky to implement a new system for online voter registration with this pending upgrade, especially leading into a presidential election. , Our highest priority is to maintain the integrity of the voter roll.

Try winning an election first\" (Page B16, Sunday), Bill King makes what is arguably perhaps, a compelling case that House Speaker John Boehners suit against President Obama is likely to fail. Such an outcome, if it happens, raises the question: \"Then what?\", The most virulent of Obama-haters among grass-roots conservatives are not going to be satisfied with anything less than impeachment proceedings. Indeed, some of their most visible members like Sarah Palin, have already called the Speaker out for failing to take that extraordinary step now. But what would be the basis for seeking that most extreme of remedies?, Unlike Presidents Reagan (Grenada) and G.W. Bush (Iraq), Obama has not started any wars without a formal declaration of same from Congress. The number of executive orders that Obama has issued falls well below that of each of his aforementioned predecessors. , What is more, the current presidents unilateral decision to delay for a year the implementation of the employer mandate within Obamacare is not fundamentally different from G.W. Bushs side-stepping Congress to modify the timetable for seniors enrollment in Medicare Part-D. Simply put, there is nothing in the Obama record that hasnt already been matched and even exceeded by previous presidents. , Marty Adams, Houston, , U.S. Constitution, Bill King seems considerably weaker than House Speaker John Boehner on U.S. Constitutional law. Boehner stated on June 25: \" the Constitution makes it clear a presidents job is to faithfully execute the laws. In my view, the president has not faithfully executed the laws. We have a system of government outlined in our Constitution with the Executive Branch, Legislative Branch and the Judicial Branch.\", The presidential oath Obama has now taken twice isnt only about faithfully executing laws.  Obama has disregarded the underlined portion of his oath: \"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\", Obama violated his oath during his first term when he usurped the power of Congress to enact legislation by issuing an executive order instituting the Dream Act  after Congress specifically declined to enact it. Now, Obama seeks to expand his imperial presidency with executive orders as a mandate of his re-election. Sorry, but winning two presidential elections doesnt allow a president to ignore the Constitution. , As for Kings cavalier attitude toward the Supreme Court enforcing a ruling that the president usurped the Legislative Branch, its instructive to consult Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution: \"The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.\", Neil Stovall, Houston]", "Date": "20140715", "Title": "[Wednesday letters: Suing the president]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/article/Wednesday-letters-Suing-the-president-5623947.php", "Author": "[Copyright 2014: Houston Chronicle]"}

(AP)  Would-be boaters in the market for a tricked-out 28-footer with high-end electronics, radar, underwater lighting and an engine with joystick piloting would have gotten a tax break under a bill the Democrat-led Legislature sent Gov. Chris Christie, but the Republican countered with his own proposal: slashing the sales tax on even the most modest of dinghies. , Christie put forward the idea of cutting the 7 percent tax on boats in half in a conditional veto last week of legislation that would have capped sales tax at $20,000. Now Democratic state senator and bill sponsor Jeff Van Drew says he expects Christies revisions to be considered by lawmakers as soon as September. , Senate President Steve Sweeney said he is considering the legislation and the state Senate will most likely adopt it, though he added he wants a review completed of the cost to the state before signing off on the measure. , Lawmakers say they proposed the legislation because marinas and other boat retailers along the states coast were suffering because of Superstorm Sandy and competition from other states with lower taxes. , The bill that went to Christies desk would have affected boats that cost roughly $286,000, which translates into 70 to 140 vessels, the Office of Legislative Services estimated. But a broader cut would affect many more  such high-priced boats are only a fraction of the $160 million in new boat sales the National Marine Manufacturers Association said were made in the state last year. , Marina operators and boat retailers are hopeful the lower rate would go into effect. , Skip Harrison, general manager of Baywood Marina in Brick, says the benefit of a $20,000 cap alone probably would not boost business as much as a sales tax decrease. The most popular boat he sells goes for about $40,000, well below the price at which the cap would take effect. , \"The difference is selling a boat or not selling a boat,\" he said. , Ernie Utsch of Utschs Marina in Cape May also backs Christies proposal. He called the states tax collection system \"onerous\" and said he sees state officials checking out-of-state registration at his marina aiming to collect the 7 percent use tax from nonresidents, which would also be cut under Christies proposal. , \"This is how it works, and this is one of the problems,\" he said. \"So by Gov. Christie doing what hes doing  not only for the big boaters  it covers a whole gamut of boaters, which is your middle class.\", The tax break under the vetoed legislation could have cost the state between $3 million and $4 million, according to legislative estimates. Estimates for Christies proposal are not yet available, but Sweeney indicated its likely to cost more than the vetoed provision. , The issue comes to the foreground as Christie spends time outside New Jersey seeking the Republican nomination for president. Its impossible to look at a potential tax cut without applying the filter of the presidential race, said Seton Hall associate political science professor Matthew Hale. , \"I think Gov. Christie has as real problem in that a lot of Republican primary voters and caucus goers think that hes too liberal,\" Hale said. \"This is an example of him saying to these right-wing voters, I really am a fiscal conservative.\", Christie, though, cast the issue as a boost to the states struggling economy. , \"Lowering taxes on New Jersey residents and supporting the continued economic growth of our shore communities following the impact of Superstorm Sandy are laudable goals,\" Christie said in a statement. , The Legislatures bill also included a grace period against the use tax for boats used in the state for fewer than 90 days per year.

Ambassador Rafael Ramirez Carreno told the council after the statement was read at an open meeting that it violates \"the sovereignty and self-determination of the Syrian people by promoting a political transition including the establishment of a transitional government without its consent and thus goes against the Charter of the United Nations.\", Nonetheless, Ramirez Carreno said Venezuela decided to act in a \"constructive spirit in not preventing this document because we sincerely believe that we have to give peace a chance and that we have to give political solutions a chance.\", Frances deputy U.N. ambassador Alexis Lamek said what matters is that the Security Council has \"regained unity\" and adopted \"a significant statement on the political process in Syria\" by consensus. \"I think thats a major achievement,\" he said. , Lamek said the statement also makes clear that \"we will not defeat terrorism if there is not an organized transition in Syria.\", The statement urges all parties \"to engage in good faith\" with de Mistura who plans to hold simultaneous discussions among the Syrian parties on key aspects of the 2012 Geneva roadmap. The four \"working groups\" he called for will tackle safety and protection of civilians including medical access and the release of detainees; political and constitutional issues; combating terrorism and military and security issues; and reconstruction and development. , Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said the U.N. hopes to get the four working groups operational in September. , The council statement condemns \"the ongoing and multiple terrorist acts\" in Syria by the Islamic State group and the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front and \"reaffirms its resolve to address all aspects of the threat.\" It stresses that \"the only sustainable solution to the current crisis in Syria is through an inclusive and Syrian-led political process that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people.\", The statement reiterates the councils demands for all parties to stop attacks on civilians, including by shelling and dropping barrel bombs, and expresses \"grave alarm\" at the humanitarian crisis which has forced 12 million people to flee their homes, including over 4 million who have sought refuge in neighboring countries.]", "Date": "20150817", "Title": "[UN approves statement aimed at restoring peace to Syria]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/us/article/UN-approves-statement-aimed-at-restoring-peace-to-6449121.php", "Author": "[Edith M.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Christians United for Israel campaigner Gary Bauer to the gates of the White House. , Code Pinks presence was a given. Led by Medea Benjamin, who in the past few years has interrupted everyone from President Barack Obama to Henry Kissinger, the group relentlessly works its way into congressional hearings and political events. If there is a picture of a political figure with angry protesters holding signs behind him, odds are Code Pink did it. (The pinkness is a play on the long-defunct, much mocked Department of Homeland Security color code for potential risks.), Cruz issued his familiar arguments against the Iran deal. Code Pink activists, easily able to swarm an outdoor event like this, kept heckling. After a few minutes, Cruz dared the loudest heckler to stand and debate him. , \"It is very interesting to see those who profess to believe in free speech be afraid of speech,\" said Cruz. \"Hold on a second  Sir, come forward. You want to be a part of the discussion?\", The main heckler stood down, and Code Pink dispatched Benjamin to debate Cruz. He talked about the deal, specifically. She talked about the benefits of diplomacy, generally. , \"Over $100 billion will flow to Iran that they will use to fund jihadists\" that will murder people, said Cruz. , \"The only way were going to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon is through negotiation,\" said Benjamin, who insisted that Irans real nuclear ambitions were still mysterious, or over-hyped. , \"I think in debates, truth matters,\" said Cruz. \"One entity with whom there is no ambiguity, in terms of whether Iran wants nuclear weapons, is Ayatollah Khameini. . . . I recognize that the Code Pink folks like to hold up signs saying, Peace with Iran. Do you know who doesnt reciprocate those views? Iran.\", Code Pink protesters did not stutter or falter. But they were pitted against one of the best debaters at the high levels of American politics. This encounter did not make the rounds on the left; it went viral on the right. , A recap of the debate became the top trending story at the Washington Examiner. Washington Free Beacon reporter Adam Kredo, who stood next to Cruz during the debate, reported that the senator \"tussled with and shut down a group of left wing activists.\" On the first-generation conservative blog Powerline, it was reported that Cruz had \"crushed\" Code Pink. , Few senators would have bothered. , Earlier this year, when a Code Pink heckler interrupted a meeting of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. , told the \"low-life scum\" to exit. Security made it so. , But Cruz saw a chance to work a punching bag, in full view of the conservative base that he courts.

Median income is a broad measure of the economic health of the middle class. , The poverty rate also showed no statistically significant change. In 2014, the poverty rate in the United States was 14.8 percent, which was the same as in 2013. The poverty rate had dropped in 2013 from 15 percent in 2012, the first such drop since 2006. , There were 46.7 million people in poverty, which is also a statistically similar number from the previous four years. In 2014, a family with two adults and two children was categorized as in poverty if their income was less than $24,008. , Census officials said they werent surprised by the flat numbers. \"Its not unusual for it not to go down two years in a row,\" said Trudi J. Renwick, chief of the Poverty Statistics Branch in the bureaus Housing and Household Economic Statistics Division. , The White House focused on the fact that some of the numbers increased, though census officials noted the change was not significant. \"Real median income for family households rose $408 in 2014, while real median income for non-family households also rose but overall median household income declined,\" administration officials said in a news release. , Republicans argued that the stagnating numbers reveal a need for change to the countrys welfare programs. , \"Our current approach to fighting poverty, though well-intended, is failing too many Americans,\" said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican. \"This disappointing data, five years into an economic recovery, underscores the need for a new effort to modernize our countrys safety net programs.\", The latest numbers will feed into the 2016 political debate, with both parties trying to position themselves as advocates for the middle class. , The numbers may explain some of the political furor going on in the country, said Lawrence Mishel, president and CEO of the liberal Economic Policy Institute. \"Anyone wondering why people in this country are feeling so ornery need look no further than this report,\" Mishel said. \"Wages have been broadly stagnant for a dozen years and median household income peaked in 1999.\", The Census report also showed that the number of uninsured Americans dropped in 2014, as the big coverage expansion in President Barack Obamas law took effect. The share of the population uninsured the whole year was 10.4 percent, or 33 million people. When compared to 2013, nearly 9 million people gained coverage. A recent government survey that includes data from the first three months of this year shows that the uninsured rate continued to fall in 2015. , The report also said:,  Asian households had the highest median income in the United States at $74,300 in 2014. The median income for non-Hispanic white households was $60,300, for black households $35,400 and Hispanic households $42,500. The median income for white households decreased by 1.7 percent between 2013 and 2014, while there was no statistically significant change for black, Asian, and Hispanic households. ,  The 2014 median earning of men was $50,400, while the median earning for women was $39,600. Neither number was statistically different from 2013. ,  The median income of households maintained by the foreign-born increased 4.3 percent while the median income of households maintained by a native-born person declined 2.3 percent. The income of naturalized citizens and noncitizens were not statistically different from the year before. ,  The number of men and women working full-time, year-round jobs increased by 1.2 million and 1.6 million, respectively, between 2013 and 2014.

{"Content": "[ When Mike Huckabee accused President Barack Obama of forging a nuclear deal with Iran that would lead Jews to the \"oven door,\" Jeb Bush made use of the moment. He could have asserted his pro-Israel credentials in different language. Or, sensing little gain in the transaction, he might have simply reiterated his condemnation of the administrations Iran policy. , Instead, Bush used the occasion to reinforce his own distance from his partys flammable fringe. , \"Look, Ive been to Israel - not as many times as Mike Huckabee, who I respect,\" Bush said to MSNBC on Monday. \"But the use of that kind of language, its just wrong. This is not the way were going to win elections, thats not how were going to solve problems.\", A good way to tell the Republican base that you share their values even if you dont speak their language is to signal concern that blunt talk will prove self-defeating - costing votes in the general election. Thats what Bush said; then he said something more interesting: that rhetoric like Huckabees is \"not how were going to solve problems.\", Solving problems is not high on the bases list of priorities, judging by the robust level of support for Donald Trump. The billionaires invective-laden, policy-free and fact-challenged campaign has proved an effective conduit for rage. But Trump scarcely even pretends to be in the solutions business. , Bush strategy is grown-upism, In one of the most remarkable political comments of recent years, Bush said last fall that a Republican candidate had to be willing to lose the primary to win the general election. Bush didnt have to explain why. His premise was widely understood as an expression of concern about his partys affinity for candidates promising a demolition derby in Washington. , So far, hes running as if he meant it. Bushs strategy might be called grown- upism. He doesnt just turn down invitations to stoke anger; he treats them as opportunities to show restraint. , Trumps emergence appears to be aiding him. Trump hasnt simply shut off attention to competitors. He has, for the moment, locked down a group of voters who might ultimately make their way to a more viable Bush competitor, especially Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. (Ohio Gov. John Kasich, by contrast, has probably been too accommodating of both government in general and Obama in particular by accepting Obamacares expansion of Medicaid in his state. Any increase in his vote share is unlikely to be derived from the base.), Trumps success has allowed Bush to run not only as the unapologetic establishment candidate he is, but as a challenge to Trumpism and the anti-government extremism it represents. (At least what it represents this week; its possible that Trumpism is not an ideologically fixed manifesto.),  While many of his partys voters are dreaming of mass deportation of undocumented, largely Hispanic immigrants, Bush keeps finding ways to remind them why his Spanish is so fluent. , \"We are very Hispanic in the sense that we speak Spanish at home,\" Bush said to Telemundo - in Spanish - referring to his wife and children. \"Columba is very Mexican. She is proud of her U.S. citizenship naturally, but we eat Mexican food at home. Our children are Hispanic in many aspects, and we dont talk about that. But yes, the Hispanic influence in my family is something quite important in my life.\", Campaigning against the wind, None of this would be possible without the enormous assets Bush brings to the campaign - his fundraising prowess, his name recognition and his familys political network. Without them, he would be an interesting GOP anomaly campaigning against gale-force winds. , Money and connections make Bush an establishment horse. But at least in the early going, a loud billionaire is preoccupying the voters most eager to thwart Bushs rise. Bush isnt the type to run a race with abandon.

(AP)  Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach said he agrees with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps proposals to build a wall along the southern border and end \"birthright citizenship\" for children born to parents who are in the U.S. illegally. , Kobach advised Mitt Romney on immigration policy during his 2012 presidential campaign, and he said it was he who urged Romney to espouse making it impossible to find work for those in the U.S. illegally, thus making them more likely to leave. , Romney won just 27 percent of the Latino vote in 2012, the worst performance for a GOP nominee in 16 years. , Kobach rejected GOP fears that taking a hardline stance on immigration will hurt the partys chances in the 2016 general election. And he dismissed a Republican Party \"autopsy\" of the 2012 election that recommended the GOP should embrace \"comprehensive immigration reform,\" saying its conclusions are based on the opinions of only a few people.

{"Content": "[ With polls showing New Jersey Gov. Chris Christies status as a potential frontrunner in the next presidential election slippingin the wake of his \"Bridgegate\" scandal, a familiar name is returning to the fore  Rep. Paul Ryan. , But while some Republican operatives see a clear path to the White House for Mitt Romneys former running mate, no one seems sure whether Ryan is actually interested in running. , \"If he wants it, he can probably have it,\" one Republican strategist told Business Insider of the 2016 GOP nomination. \"The thing is, Im not sure if he wants it.\", Christies diminished standing in presidential polls has left Ryan among the leaders of potential Republican candidates.Two other GOP governors  Wisconsins Scott Walker and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush  have also seen their stocks rise as Christie stumbles. But the consensus among nearly a dozen Republican consultants and political strategists is that Ryan is one of the strongest potential 2016 GOP candidates. In their minds, the only remaining question is whether Ryan actually wants to run in 2016  and if hes ready to forego years of powerful positions in the House of Representatives. , Heres the case for Ryan: Hes viewed as one of the smartest people in the Republican Party. Ryan already survived a trial run and vetting in 2012 and he handled his time well on the national stage. Hes also starting to build a brand of bipartisanship  he recently struck a budget deal with Senate Democratsand has been one of the leading voices urging Republicans to take up the issue of immigration reform. , \"His numbers are robust, the field is wide open and he acquitted himself well in 2016,\" Republican strategist Rick Wilson told Business Insider in an email.\"Like of lot of people, I suspect there are those around Paul whispering, Do it. Go for it. Whats the worst that can happen? knowing he could hold his House seat and seniority if the Presidential doesnt work out.\", Then there are the caveats: This early in the cycle, with about two years to go before the first nominating contests, Ryans prime positioning in the polls could simply stem from the fact he has higher name recognition than other candidates after his presence on the ticket in 2012. Furthermore, the recent poll showing Ryan leading the pack isnt necessarily a sign of a stronger trend. Other polls have left him in the middle of a crowded field that includes Christie, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, and Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and Rand Paul (R-Ky.). , However, Ryans poll numbers may be a moot point. Several consultants, indicated the prevailing sense among Republican politicos is that Ryan wants to stick around for a while in the House. The 44-year-old Ryan is in line to become chairman of the powerful Ways & Means Committee, where he could lead an overhaul of the tax code. , Ryan could take over as chairman of the committee next January, and Republicans are ready to rally around him. The chairmanship would put Ryan at the forefront of many of the most high-profile and critical policy issues, including health care and tax policy. Ryan could still run for president as Ways & Means chairman, but the time commitments and high-profile nature of the position could present potential pitfalls. Because of this,GOP strategist Matt Mackowiack told Business Insider he thinks the committee is Ryans top priority. , \"The primary objective and the goal, I think, is Ways & Means,\"Mackowiack said. \"And the stars are aligning for that.\", Ryan also has two young children, and is described frequently as someone who \"enjoys his weekends\" home in Wisconsin with them. And others worry that if Ryan does want to get into the race, hes already far behind his potential competitors. , \"Hes one of theleast political politicians Ive ever come across,\" said Mackowiack, who heard Ryan speak a few weeks ago in San Antonio, Texas, where he disavowed any desire to become the next Speaker of the House. , Mackowiack also cited an absence of the chatter that typically surrounds potential presidential candidates. , \"There are just little things  no ones evenwhispering name to reporters, like other candidates are doing.\", Still, despite questions about his desire, Ryan has understandable appeal for Republican operatives eager to win a White House race after back-to-back losses. Ryan is frequently cast as the type of candidate  like Christie before \"Bridgegate\" and, perhaps, fellow Wisconsinite Scott Walker  who has bipartisan bonafides and can bridge the divide among staunch conservatives, more moderate Republicans, and Independent voters. , Ryan has been on both sides of recent issues dividing the conservative grassroots from the Republican establishment in Washington. In December, he joined House Speaker John Boehners war of words with conservatives over his budget accord. After Rubio criticized the deal, Ryan seemed dumbfounded and accused him of not reading the bill.About two months later, Ryan went against leadership in joining the vast majority of Republicans to vote against the recent suspension of the debt ceiling. , \"Theres conservative angst about him on some votes,\" a Republican strategist said, citing Ryans support for TARP and a debt-ceiling hike. \"In this case, especially since there was just nothing there for conservatives to like, I think he played it smart.\", Ryan, for his part, isnt actively putting a stop to the speculation. Last month, Ryan visited New Hampshire, which is a regular stop for presidential aspirants due to its traditional status as the first state in the nation to hold a primary election. During his visit to the Granite StateRyan was asked whether he has his eye on 2016. He told reportershes focusing on his job as chair of the House Budget Committee and would \"worry about those things\" later. , Still, theres a very real feeling that Ryan is primed to be next in line among Republican candidates -- if he wants it. , \"To the extent we have an heir apparent,\" one consultant said, \"hes it.\", Join the conversation about this story , See Also:]", "Date": "20140304", "Title": "[Paul Ryan Could Be The GOP's Secret Weapon In 2016  If He Wants To Run]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/default/article/Paul-Ryan-Could-Be-The-GOP-s-Secret-Weapon-In-5285459.php", "Author": "[Brett LoGiurato, provided by]"}

Healthcare should be an affordable choice, not a mandate on taxpayers.

And, I would note, every time Republicans do that we lose.\", According to Toobin Cruz cited Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan as examples of conservatives who won elections and President Gerald Ford as a moderate who lost. , \"President George Herbert Walker Bush ran as a strong conservative, ran to continue the third term of Ronald Reagan, continue the Ronald Reagan revolution,\" Cruz said. \"Then he raised taxes and in 92 ran as an establishment moderatesame candidate, two very different campaigns. First one won, second one lost. In 1996, you got Bob Dole; 2000 and 2004, you have George W. Bush; 2008, John McCain; 2012, Mitt Romney. And what does the entire D.C. Republican consulting class say? In 2016, we need another establishment moderate! Hasnt worked in four decades. But next time will be the time!\", Later on in the story, Toobin questioned Cruzs theory. , \"Cruzs historical narrative of Presidential politics is both self-serving and questionable on its own terms. Conveniently, he begins his story after the debacle of Barry Goldwater, a conservative purist whom Cruz somewhat resembles,\" wrote Toobin. \"Nixon ran as a healer and governed, by contemporary standards, as a moderate, opening up relations with China, signing into law measures banning sex discrimination, expanding the use of affirmative action, establishing the Environmental Protection Agency, and signing the Clean Air Act. Reagans record as governor of California included support for tax increases, gun control, and abortion rights, so he sometimes appeared less conservative than his modern reputation suggests. George W. Bush won (if he won) as a self-advertised compassionate conservative.\", Toobin also suggested Cruzs prediction a conservative Republican would have a strong shot at the White House \"has not evoked much fear in Democrats.\" He quoted one anonymous \"Democratic senator\" who described Cruz as the Walter Mondale of the GOP. Mondale, a Democratic former vice president, badly lost the 1984 presidential election to Reagan while running as an unabashed liberal. , \"We all hope he runs,\" the senator said of Cruz. , Join the conversation about this story , See Also:]", "Date": "20140623", "Title": "[Here's Why Ted Cruz Thinks A Moderate Republican Won't Win In 2016]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/default/article/Here-s-Why-Ted-Cruz-Thinks-A-Moderate-Republican-5572454.php", "Author": "[Hunter Walker, provided by]"}

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is eligible to run for US president with an article published in the Harvard Law Review earlier this month. , In an email to Business Insider last week, Cruzs senior adviser Catherine Frazier said the campaign is pointing any reporters who ask about Cruzs eligibility to the March 11 article by Neal Katyal and Paul Clement. , \"Any coverage on this issue should include the Harvard Law Review article by Katyal and Clement,\" Frazier wrote. , Questions have been raised about Cruzs eligibility as he was born in Canada to an American mother and a Cuban-born father. , Most experts agree his mothers American citizenship makes him a \"natural born citizen,\" which is one of the constitutional requirements for presidential eligibility. But in an analysis of the issue published by Politifact in 2013, they concluded there is the \"tiniest sliver of uncertainty\" about whether Cruz is legally eligible to be president, because the phrase \"natural born citizen\" has never been explicitly defined by a Constitutional amendment or Supreme Court ruling. , In their article, Katyal and Clement argue that there is no uncertainty whatsoever about whether children of American citizens who were born abroad are \"natural born citizens.\", Both Katyal and Clement have served as the acting solicitor general of the US. Katyal held the post in the administration of President Barack Obama while Clement served under President George W. Bush. They began their article by noting that they may have different political views but are in complete agreement about the definition of a \"natural born citizen.\", \"We have both had the privilege of heading the Office of the Solicitor General during different administrations,\" they wrote. \"We may have different ideas about the ideal candidate in the next presidential election, but we agree on one important principle: voters should be able to choose from all constitutionally eligible candidates, free from spurious arguments that a U.S. citizen at birth is somehow not constitutionally eligible to serve as President simply because he was delivered at a hospital abroad.\", In their article, Katyal and Clement claimed \"the phrase natural born Citizen has a specific meaning: namely, someone who was a US citizen at birth with no need to go through a naturalization proceeding at some later time.\" They argued \"all the sources routinely used to interpret the Constitution\" are clear on this definition. , Specifically, Katyal and Clement cited British common law, which they said \"recognized that children born outside of the British Empire to subjects of the Crown were subjects themselves and explicitly used natural born to encompass such children\" in the 18th Century. They also argued the First Congress in the US and the Naturalization Act of 1790 similarly explicitly defined children born to Americans in foreign countries as \"natural born citizens.\", In their conclusion, Katyal and Clement said theres \"no question\" about Cruzs eligibility to run for president. , \"Despite the happenstance of a birth across the border, there is no question that Senator Cruz has been a citizen from birth and is thus a natural born Citizen within the meaning of the Constitution,\" they wrote. , Katyal declined to comment when Business Insider asked if he had been in communication with Cruzs campaign and was aware they were citing his article.

{"Content": "[During a prominent gathering of conservatives in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire, the largest spattering of boos among the crowd didnt come at speakers frequent mentions of President Barack Obama. , The loudest jeers came when a speaker would mention former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. , \"You know, I heard Jeb Bush the other day,\" mogul Donald Trump said during his speech at the Freedom Summit, hosted by the conservative groups Citizens United and the Americans for Prosperity Foundation. He paused in his speech as the boos started. , As chatter heats up about a Bush possibly running for president in 2016, he faces a potentially significant obstacle  convincing the conservative base to rally around him as a Republican nominee. , Conservatives problems with Bush, the brother of former President George W. Bush and younger son of President George H.W. Bush,are threefold. First, he supports overhauling the nations immigration system, something that has made some on the right charge he supports \"amnesty\" for undocumented immigrants living in the US. Bush also has embraced the Common Core educational standards, a policy that is quickly becoming the \"Obamacare\" of education on the right. , And, to a lesser extent, conservatives also agree with the sentiment of Bush over-saturation. They are tired of the Bush name representing the Republican Party, and they want to avoid a potential third Bush in office over the last five presidencies. , \"Bushas a last name\" is an issue, said Erick Erickson, the editor in chief of the conservative news site RedState. \"It is the same problems the Democrats have. Lets go forward by going backward. Not exactly a winning slogan.\", But the bases problem with Bush begins with his positions on immigration and education. Some conservatives see Bush as pseudo-repeat version of 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney  a candidate they were reluctant to back in the 2012 election, before he became the Republican Partys go-to surrogate in this election cycle. , Steve Deace, a prominent conservative in the crucial early presidential state of Iowa, summed up conservatives problem with Jeb Bush: Hes everything they hated about Romney, and nothing they liked about him. , \"Im saying theres a chance\" Bush could win the backing of conservatives and the nomination, Deace told Business Insider in an email, adding, \"The same chance I have tolook good in a thong.\", , Bush was the target of ire at the Freedom Summit in April because of remarks he made earlier in the week about undocumented immigrants  many of whom, he said, came to the US out of an \"act of love\" for their families. , In general, Bush supports an overhaul of the nations immigration laws, and he has saidthe bipartisan Senate bill passed last June was a \"good effort\" toward accomplishing that goal. The Senates bill, which garnered the support of 14 Republicans, has been a non-starter in the House amid fierce pushback from the chambers conservative wing. , Conservatives disapproval of both Obama and congressional Republicans on the issue of immigration only heightened this summer, when tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants streamed across the US-Mexico border. , Even Mike Huckabee, a fellow potential 2016 Republican candidate who is more sympathetic to immigration reform than other conservative prospects, attacked Bushs April comments. , \"I think what Jeb was trying to say was that many people come to the United States to look for opportunity,\" Huckabee said. \"I dont personally support amnesty. I think we ought to have a secure border.\", But an increasingly important issue among conservative activists is the Common Core education standards, which one conservative who spoke to Business Insider called \"Obamacore.\" The activist said it had the potential to be \"Jebs Romneycare,\" referring to the Massachusetts healthcare law mirroring the federal Affordable Care Act that was passed during Romneys tenure as governor of the state. , Bushs overall record on education during his tenure as governor is well-admired on the right. His \"A+ plan\" placed a greater emphasis on standardized testing in Florida, and he instituted broad school choice featuring vouchers and charter schools. However, Bush also took an active role in implementing the Common Core standards and continues to be perhaps their staunchest defender on the right. , \"Hes the poster-child for Common Core,\" Deace said. , The Common Core standards were developed by a group appointed by the National Governors Association, the bipartisan organization of the nations governors. The standards were adopted in mid-2009, intending to foster greater academic achievement and allow for comparable standards across states. One of its goals, as stated by the NGA, was to return power back to states after President George W. Bushs No Child Left Behind law let the federal government play a major role in state education standards. , Conservatives began souring on the Common Core law after the Obama administration tied certain grants to states adoption of the standards. But as the rights opposition has grown, Bush and the group he co-founded,the Foundation for Excellence inEducation, have dug in with their support. Bush has even suggested opponents of Common Core are dabbling in conspiracy theories. , \"Never under-estimate moms,\" Erickson said. \"The Chamber of Commerce types have spun this as no big deal and no causing harm. But it is only just rolling out. This is becoming an issue and will be an issue with the base that hurtsJebbecause of his defense.\", How Bush deals with conservative opposition to his stances on immigration and Common Core will likely determine how far he gets in the nomination process, should he choose to run.He has two options. One involves making a very un-Romney-like move and continuing to defend his views on both immigration and on Common Core. , This would represent a contrast from Romney, who entered the 2012 GOP primary open to immigration reform before eventually famously saying undocumented immigrants should self-deport. Romney also moved markedly away from the universal healthcare law he helped design as governor of Massachusetts, even as some supporters touted it as his biggest achievement. But, if Bush adopts this strategy, it could also more firmly alienate a moderate base he needs to win over to win the nomination. , Bushs second potential strategy would involve gently softening his position on both issues, like Romney did, over the next year. This is what multiple prominent conservatives believe he will do. On immigration, this will include likely pointing to his 2013 book, \"Immigration Wars,\" in which he came out against a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. On Common Core, Bush will likely emphasize that he only cares about the standards  not the name. , As Erickson said, \"He has Romneys position, and Romney got the nomination.\", \"I think we need someone new to be the partys leader,\" he said. \"Its just no one is sure who that should be, which givesJeban advantage.\", , Join the conversation about this story , See Also:, SEE ALSO:Heres Why Jeb Bush Would Be The GOPs Immediate Front-Runner If He Runs For President]", "Date": "20141101", "Title": "[Conservatives Are Already Freaking Out About Jeb Bush's Possible Run For President]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/default/article/Conservatives-Are-Already-Freaking-Out-About-Jeb-5863085.php", "Author": "[Brett LoGiurato, provided by]"}

But he doesnt love some more than others,\" he said. \"I learned the Pledge of Allegiance, the Lords prayer, and the Preamble of the Constitution. We prayed at the start of each day and we prayed again before lunch. And I learned that this exceptional country could only be explained by the providence of Almighty God.\", Like former President Bill Clinton, who also hailed from Hope, Huckabee constantly referenced their hometown as a metaphor. , \"It was here that I was baptized in the Garrett Memorial Baptist Church after accepting Jesus in a vacation Bible school when I was just 10 years old. I truly went from Hope to higher ground,\" he said. , Huckabee s religious messaging is undoubtedly meant to appeal to the same evangelical voters that formed his base in the 2008 presidential race. In that contest, Huckabee won the Iowa caucuses and performed well throughout the South before ultimately losing the nomination to Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona). , The stronger field of Republican candidates in 2016 will likely make Huckabees path even more difficult this time around. However, Huckabee is clearly not backing down and he vowed, as president, he will stand up to \"the false God of judicial supremacy\"  his term for the federal courts that have widely found a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. , \"Weve lost our way morally.

And we are now threatening the foundation of religious liberty by criminalizing Christianity and demanding we abandon Biblical principles of natural marriage,\" he said. \"My friends, the Supreme Court is not the Supreme Being and they cannot overturn the laws of nature or of natures God.\", , In another apparent Biblical reference, Huckabee compared jihadist militants like the Islamic State group (also known as ISIS) to \"deadly snakes.\" He contrasted his approach to terrorism with President Barack Obama, who drew controversy in February by urging Christians to get off their \"high horse\" before criticizing Islam. , \"When I hear our current president say he wants Christians to get off their high horse so we can make nice with radical jihadists, I wonder if he could watch a Western from the 50s and be able to figure out who they good guys and the bad guys really are,\" he said. \"As president, I promise you that we will no longer try to merely contain jihadism, we will conquer it! We will deal with jihadis just as we would deal with deadly snakes.\", Even when Huckabee was addressing issues like immigration reform, he invoked his faith. , \"As Americans, we ought to get onto our knees every night and thank God we still live in a country that people are trying to break into rather than one theyre trying to break out of,\" he said to cheers. , Huckabee is the third Republican candidate to throw his hat into the presidential race this week.

And it is unlikely to be an issue on which his administration will be able to make further changes before he leaves. , Obama admitted this during his comments last Thursday following the shooting, saying \"it is in our power to do something about [mass shootings]. , \"I say that recognizing the politics in this town foreclose a lot of those avenues right now. But itd be wrong for us not to acknowledge it, and at some point, its going to important for the American to come to grips with it and for us to be able to shift how we think about the issue of gun violence collectively,\" Obama said. , Whether you believe fewer guns will lead to fewer mass shootings  or that more guns will give people the ability to defend themselves  the needle is unlikely to move in either direction until a new president takes office in 2017. , But with the issue back in the limelight, it will likely become a featured topic on the campaign trail.

In the wake of the Charleston shooting, OMalley launched what his aides described as a \"major push\" to reform the nations gun laws, saying he was \"pissed\" that observers keep asking how many more incidents it will take to institute any reforms. , The most poisonous force in American politics today is not the bad people who do bad things, OMalley said on Monday at the U.S. Conference of Mayors in San Francisco. It is the good people who do nothing. . . .If the thousands of young men killed by gun violence every year across America were young, poor and white rather than young, poor and black, it is hard to imagine that our Congress would continue to block common-sense measures to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.\", OMalley has said he \"proudly\" holds an F rating from the NRA. , , Sanders has an uncertain track record when it comes to guns. As Politico reported, Sanders campaign manager says he is \"very moderate\" when it comes to gun control. However in the past, Sanders has voted against the Brady Bill (law that requires a waiting period for handgun purchases and background checks on those who wish to purchase handguns), voted for a ban on assault weapons, voted to allow firearms on Amtrak trains, and voted for universal background checks. , He did not speak publicly following the Charleston shooting, but his campaign manager released a statement. ,  \"This sick and tragic attack is an example of why we need to ensure that guns do not end up in the hands of dangerous people,\" the statement read. , , According to Rhode Island Public Radio, Chafee has voted to ban semi-automatic assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in Rhode Island. He hasalso voted against federal legislation that would have banned lawsuits against gun manufacturers. , , Bush has an \"A+\" rating from the National Rifle Association (the groupgives politicians a grade based on how they vote on gun legislation) and has consistently been opposed to stricter gun laws. , \"I have a message for the Obama administration,\" Bush said at an NRA conference in Nashville in April. \"Why dont you focus more on keeping weapons out of the hands of Islamic terrorists and less on keeping weapons out of the hands of law-abiding Americans?\", Bush signed Floridas so-called \"stand your ground\" legislation into law as governor, legislation that was thrust into the national spotlight after the 2012 shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin. That law was used in Zimmermans defense. , Bush defended \"stand your ground\" laws at the NRA meeting in April. , \"In Florida you can defend yourself anywhere you have a legal right to be,\" Bush said. \"You shouldnt have to choose between being attacked and going to jail.\", , Graham toldCBS News following the Charleston shooting that he is \"open-minded\" to the modification of current gun laws. He voted against the 2013 Senate legislation that would have expanded background checks for gun purchases after the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012. , When asked if there is any solution to gun violence, Graham told CBS \"just being able to track people  put them into systems where they can be deterred or stopped.\", \"Its very complicated in a nation of 300 million people where you have freedom of movement and freedom of thought  300 million of us and unfortunately every now and then, something like this happens,\" Graham added. \"And well see. But I think usually its some disturbed person with a gun. Thats what, usually, these things are.\", Graham has said he owns several firearms. , , Ted Cruz has an \"A+\" rating from the NRA and has firmly expressed support for Second Amendment rights. , \"The Second Amendment to the Constitution isnt for just protecting hunting rights, and its not only to safeguard your right to target practice,\" Cruz has said, per the New York Times.\"It is a Constitutional right to protect your children, your family, your home, our lives, and to serve as the ultimate check against governmental tyranny  for the protection of liberty.\", Like many other Republican colleagues, Cruz voted against moving forward on the 2013 Senate legislation to expand background checks. , , Paul has an \"A\" rating from the NRA and is a strong supporter of the Second Amendment. After the Charleston shooting, he said government wouldnt be able to \"fix\" a \"sickness in our country.\", \"What kind of person goes into church and shoots nine people?\" Paul said at a Faith and Freedom summit in Washington, D.C. \"Theres a sickness in our country. Theres something terribly wrong. But it isnt going to be fixed by your government. Its people straying away, its people not understanding where salvation comes from. I think if we understand that, well have better expectations of what to expect from government.\", Paul also voted against moving forward on the 2013 Senate background-check legislation. , , Rubio has an \"A\" rating from the NRA,thanks in part to a bill he introduced into the Senate at the end of March. That bill, called the \"Second Amendment Rights in the District of Columbia\" Act, would amend D.C. gun laws and make it easier for individuals to obtain firearms. , Following the Sandy Hook massacre, Rubio voted against the Senate legislation to expand background checks on gun purchases. , , In a 2013 interview with conservative host Glenn Beck, Carson took a bit of a different line on gun rights and left some conservatives concerned about his stance. , \"It depends on where you live,\" Carson told Beck when the host asked him whether people should be allowed to own \"semi-automatic weapons.\",  \"I think if you live in the midst of a lot of people, and Im afraid that that semi-automatic weapon is going to fall into the hands of a crazy person, I would rather you not have it,\" he said. , Carson was invited to the NRA meeting earlier this year and sought to dispel any doubts about his views on gun rights. , , During his 2012 presidential campaign, Santorum was a staunch supporter of Second Amendment rights. In 2013, he said he opposed the Senates background-check legislation, instead urging a focus on mental health and the \"impact of the entertainment industrys glorification of violence.\", \"While the president did propose some reasonable measures, Im disappointed, yet not surprised, to see so much emphasis on gun control and not enough on key contributors to mass shootings  mental illness and the impact of the entertainment industrys glorification of violence,\" he said. , , Perry expanded gun rights during his tenure as governor of Texas. He has signed legislation allowing people to bring guns in their cars to work and has tried to lure gun manufacturers to the Lone Star state. Days after the Sandy Hook massacre, he said hed support arming teachers in schools. , But he has also expressed some hesitation to open-carry laws. , , Huckabee has an \"A+\" rating from the NRA and named his 2015 memoir \"God, Guns, Grits and Gravy.\", \"Clearly, city slickers who are more afraid of guns than of the criminals who might use them have a serious mental condition rendering them incapable of critical thinking,\" he wrote. , , The former CEO of Hewlett-Packard has said she isa supporter of the Second Amendment and accused Obama of \"pushing a political agenda\" after his comments in the wake of the Charleston shooting. , , Walker has an \"A+\" rating from the NRA. During his time as Wisconsin governor, Walker signed into law a bill that gives people more leeway to shoot and kill intruders, as well as a concealed-carry law. , , Pataki is perhaps the only Republican running who supports stricter gun laws. In 2000, while governor of New York, Pataki signed into law what was described at the time as the strictest gun-control legislation in the country. , , During a 2013 interview with FOX News, Trump described himself as \"a very strong person on the Second Amendment.\" But in his 2000 book \"The America We Deserve,\" Trump said he supports a ban on assault weapons and longer waiting periods on gun purchases. , , Christie has a \"C\" rating from the NRA, though he has spent time recently trying to get back into the organizations good graces.Last year,Christievetoed a bill that would have banned ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.

A slew of polls have shown her leading all her likely Democratic primary rivals. , While that kind of prime positioning obviously has its advantages, being the front-runner hasnt worked for four Democrats in recent races  including Clinton in 2008. In a recent piece, the New Yorkers Ryan Lizza spoke to experts who warned Clinton could fall into this \"inevitability trap\" once again in the next election. , On Friday, top Clinton supporters gathered in New York City for a meeting of the finance council of \"Ready For Hillary,\" a super PAC dedicated to backing her potential candidacy. Many of them shot down the notion Clinton has the White House locked up. , Ready For Hillary Executive Director Adam Parkhomenko devoted much of his sitdown with reporters at the event to batting down the idea Clinton is inevitable. , \"In terms of inevitability, I wouldnt have been doing this since Jan. 2013 if I thought she was inevitable,\"Parkhomenko said at the event, which was held at the Sheraton Times Square hotel. , Political consultant James Carville, a veteran Clinton ally, put things in even more blunt terms. , \"Its stupid. Its a stupid perception.

Its a media non-story that the media creates into a story,\" Davis told Business Insider. \"I think she has to work hard and earn the nomination. This is a media invention when they have nothing to write about. Blaming a candidate for being inevitable is like blaming the sun for rising in the east.\", Stephanie Schriock, the president of EMILYs List, a group dedicated to supporting pro-choice Democratic women, argued those who see Clinton as inevitable are ignoring the fact voters have desire for change after eight years of President Barack Obama. , \"I think the biggest challenge we have is that history says that Americans dont really like to go with the same party for three terms. So weve got our work cut out for us under the best of circumstances,\"Schriock said at a briefing with reporters. \"This is not going to be an easy election. ... Shes going to have to make the case if she decides to run.\", Schriock is rumored to be one of the leading candidates to manage Clintons White House bid.

A womans never won the Iowa caucuses. A womans never won a major party nomination. A woman has never become president.\", Parkhomenko also pointed out she hasnt officially entered the race. , \"Hillary Clinton hasnt made up her mind,\" he said. , Parkhomenko also reminded reporters at the event of Clintons loss in 2008, when she was widely seen as inevitable before being upset by Obama. , \"Its important to note that, if you go back and you look at a lot of the stories that some of the folks in this room wrote at this time in the 2008 cycle,it was Hillary Clinton vs. Rudolph Giuliani  and we know how that turned out,\" he said. , Join the conversation about this story , See Also:]", "Date": "20141121", "Title": "[Hillary Clinton's Top Supporters Insist She Could Lose In 2016]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/default/article/Hillary-Clinton-s-Top-Supporters-Insist-She-Could-5910157.php", "Author": "[Colin Campbell, provided by]"}

Boehner said Obamas overstepping started after Republicans retook control of the House of Representatives in 2011, and he said his chamber must act now \"before its too late.\", Boehner sent a memo to the House Republican conference late last month, informing them of his plans to file legislation in July that would allow the House of Representatives to file suit to compel Obama to \"faithfully execute the laws of our country.\", The White House and the president himself have jokingly dismissed the lawsuit.

Mike Huckabee, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky are all quickly moving forward with their plans for the elections in some form or another, even though voters in Iowa wont cast their ballots for at least a year. , Early in the morning, The Washington Post detailed Huckabees efforts to reconnect with supporters six years after his unsuccessful 2008 White House bid. , Huckabee is reportedly doing several things to lay the groundwork for a campaign. He is planning his reintroduction to key fundraisers over the next few months, hes keeping his 2008 campaign advisers close, and hes receiving encouragement from his family. The Post article also noted Huckabees allies commissioned polls in early primary states that they said found him leading the GOP pack by double digits. , \"There were polls done that surprised me and got my attention  and led my friends to urge me to think of this again,\" Huckabee said. , Meanwhile, Politicos Mike Allen reported Paul was set to huddle with his core political advisers on Wednesday \"to plan ahead for a likely presidential campaign.\" Allen gave Paul a 90% chance of ultimately launching a White House bid, even though the senator publicly insists he is still making up his mind. , \"Doug Stafford, executive director of RAND PAC, will sketch the tentative plans. Separate sessions will cover finance, politics and communications. Participants look at this as the kickoff of a great adventure, where theyre likely to be working shoulder-to-shoulder on a grueling national campaign. In later afternoon, the senator will join to pump up his troops, and will stay for a celebratory dinner,\" Allen wrote in his morning newsletter. , Supporters of Cruz, a conservative firebrand, also revealed their plans on Wednesday for a so-called super PAC supporting his candidacy. , \"Wed like to be $50 million by the end of March 2016, going into Super Tuesday,\"Cruz confidante Maria Strollo Zack reportedly told the Daily Mail of the PAC, called \"Stand for Principle PAC.\", However, not every Republican is rushing toward the campaign trail.

However, in October, The New York Times reported a Republican Senate takeover could prompt Clinton to launch her official exploratory committee before the end of the year. That report cited sources close to Clinton who said the Democratic party might \"need to quickly pivot to the presidential campaign\" if the midterms went badly.Of course, last weeks elections were a drubbing for Democrats, with Republicans gaining control of the Senate and winning downballot races by much higher than expected margins. , However, on Wednesday, The Hill published a piece indicating Clinton wouldnt push up her timeline based on the midterms.

Bushs 2000 presidential campaign, he brought Roberts to Florida to assist with his teams legal battle over the controversial post-election recount. , And as the Texas Tribune reported three years ago,when Bush nominated Roberts to the Supreme Court in 2005, Cruz \"was an outspoken advocate for his confirmation, calling him brilliant and a lawyers lawyer.\", \"As an individual, John Roberts is undoubtedly a principled conservative, as is the president who appointed him,\" Cruz wrote at the time in the National Review.\"But, as a jurist, Judge Robertss approach will be that of his entire career: carefully, faithfully applying the Constitution and legal precedent.\", Cruz, now running a fiercely conservative campaign for president, seemed to have a much different take on Roberts on Thursday when the Supreme Court issued its second major ruling protecting the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, In a passionate statement, Cruz tore into the courts \"robed Houdinis\"who \"transmogrified\" the law to defend President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law. Roberts wrote both of the rulings Cruz criticized. , \"Todays decision in King v. Burwell is judicial activism, plain and simple.

Jerry Nadler (D-New York) issued a statement on Friday expressing his fear President Barack Obama will \"violate the Constitution\" by expanding military operations against the jihadist group Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL) in Syria and Iraq without asking Congress for authorization. In an interview with Business Insider, Nadler said he understood the need to take on ISIS, but does not believe the group is poses enough of an \"imminent threat\" on American soil that there is no time for the president to seek congressional authorization for the use of military force. , \"Theres nothing so urgent that Congress cant take a day, or two, or three to debate it. ... Its not an obvious, imminent threat,\" Nadler said. \"The degree or how much of a threat it is and how immediate a threat it is, thats for Congress to debate, decide what to do about it.\", Nadler stressed he is not dismissing ISIS as a \"real threat\" and does not necessarily oppose the plan Obama laid out to fight the group last week. However, Nadler thinks the Constitution requires the president to seek authorization for military force or to ask Congress to declare war. , \"I dont have any great objection to what the president is proposing to do,\" said Nadler. \"In fact, I think hes right, but Congress has to authorize it. Thats my concern.\", Nadler had similar concerns about U.S. military operations in Libya in 2011, which were conducted with congressional authorization. He said he doesnt know what the Obama administration plans to do this time, but wanted to raise the issue to generate discussion among his fellow members of Congress. , \"Theres a lot of discussion about our voting on something next week, I dont know what thats going to be or if its going to be. I dont know,\" said Nadler. , Obama has suggested he could have the authority to mount a war with ISIS without congressional authorization, but the legality of that strategy has been called into question. The president also has indicated he might ask Congress for funding for some aspects of his strategy against ISIS. Nadler said requesting funding from Congress does not replace getting authorization. , \"We may be asked to fund, but that is not the same thing. ... It may have a similar practical thing, but thats not what we should do,\" Nadler explained. \"We should do what were supposed to do, which is vote for a declaration of war or authorize use of military force, which is the functional equivalent. Why not?\", Reportedly, some members of Congress are reluctant to vote for military operations against ISIS as it could become politically controversial or a liability, particularly in an election year. Nadler said he understands and even shares that concern, but does not think what he described as the \"political thing\" overrides the importance of having potential military operations approved through the proper congressional channels. , \"There clearly are a number of members who dont want to vote and I understand the politics. Im not sure I want to vote for my political thing, but I dont think we can deal with it like that,\" said Nadler. \"Its a matter of protecting the interests of the country.

He called for term limits for federal lawmakers like himself and demanded members of Congress actually read legislation before they pass it.Paul also took a veiled shot at his Republican rivals, one or more of whom he labeled \"Democrat-lite.\", \"In order to restore America, one thing is for certain, though: We cannot, we must not give dilute our message or give up on our principles. If we nominate a candidate who is simply Democrat-lite, whats the point? Why bother? We need to boldly proclaim our vision for America. We need to go boldly forth under the banner of liberty that clutches the Constitution in one hand and the Bill of Rights in the other,\" he said to cheers. , , His announcement began with a video featuring actors playing factory workers discussing their financial woes. The video included a country song with a chorus that said \"theyre living it up on Wall Street in that New York City town\" and \"here in the real world, theyre shutting Detroit down.\", Afterwards, former Rep. J.C. Watts (R-Oklahoma) introduced the pledge of allegiance. He described the event as the beginning of a \"cause.\" , Watts is a prominent African-American conservative. Following the pledge an African-American pastor gave an invocation. The symbolism of their presence was likely deliberate. Paul has given several speeches designed to reach out to minority voters and has described his views on drug reform and prison reform as advocacy for minorities. , After these introductions and a singing of the national anthem, Kentucky State Sen. Ralph Alvarado (R) took the stage. Watts said Alvarado would present \"a Guatemala video.\" , \"Its time for a President Rand Paul!\" Alvarado said before the clip began. , The video highlighted a philanthropic trip Paul took to that country. On that mission, Paul, an ophthalmologist, performed free surgeries for people in need. , A young Kentucky activist named Lauren Bosler spoke next. She expressed dissatisfaction with the Democratic and Republican parties and said Paul would take a new approach. , \"My generation is not comprised of the traditional electorate and Rand Paul is not a traditional politician,\" Bosler said. \"He is not only interested in Republican successes. He is interested in American successes.\", Bosler also stressed Pauls interest in technology, small government, and \"civil liberties,\" particularly government not restricting or monitoring peoples use of new technologies. A video then played of Paul giving a speech about the needs of the \"Facebook generation.\", \"If you have a cell phone, you are under surveillance. I believe what you do on your cell phone is none of their damn business,\" Paul said in the clip. , , After some more speeches and videos, Watts unveiled a clip of Pauls wife, Kelley discussing how they met. , \"I kind of blew him off at first, but Rand kept trying,\" she said. , She also attributed Pauls medical career to watching his grandmother struggle with vision problems. Kelley then gave a speech praising Pauls legislative record. , \"Rand is truly a different kind of legislator, which has earned him descriptions like the one man think tank,\" she said. , Paul took the stage following his wife. , Pauls announcement made him the second top tier Republican presidential candidate after Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who launched his campaign on March 23. , Paul, whose father is former congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul, was elected in 2010. Since then he has become known for his libertarian-leaning positions on foreign policy, drug policy, and the economy. The elder Paul was in attendance at his sons launch. , In the presidential race, Paul is expected to eschew the Republican establishment and try to build a grassroots base of atypical supporters including younger voters and minorities. , This post was continuously updated through 12:56 p.m. , Join the conversation about this story , NOW WATCH: Heres how President Obama starts every morning, See Also:]", "Date": "20150407", "Title": "[RAND PAUL: 'We have come to take our country back!']", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/default/article/RAND-PAUL-We-have-come-to-take-our-country-6184146.php", "Author": "[Hunter Walker, provided by]"}

Jeb Bush (R) might actually help him win the 2016 GOP presidential primary. , And Paul isnt the only one who thinks this trio of high-powered rivals could give him an edge. , In a recent conversation with Business Insider, a close ally of one of the other candidates went so far as to say the current likely composition of the Republican field gives Paul the best shot at a victory. , \"Based on where the primary electorate is right now, if theres a front-runner in this race from an electoral perspective, its probably Rand Paul,\" the source said. , The theory behind this is that Romney, Christie, and Bush are all relative moderates and would split the same segment of the vote in a Republican primary. This would leave room for someone like Paul to stand out and score wins in crucial states. , In an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Paul said that was exactly how he would like the race to play out. , \"The more the merrier as far as Im concerned. I think we have place in the party for moderates like Christie, and Bush, and Romney. And then therell also be conservatives,\" Paul said. \"Hopefully  at least from a conservative point of view  we hope the moderates will divide up the moderate vote and maybe allow a conservative to be the nominee. Its been quite a while since weve really had the conservative come forward as the nominee.\", Paul also argued that his libertarian-oriented policy agenda gave him a \"little bit of an edge\" over his more orthodox Republican rivals. , , \"The libertarian issues give a little bit of an edge that brings in young people, working class, people that are concerned with privacy, minorities who are concerned with minority rights,\" he said. \"The question to me is whether or not that message will resonate ... I would only get involved if we really think we have a chance to win.\", However, the source allied with one of the other candidates told Business Insider they thought Pauls more libertarian, noninterventionist positioning on foreign policy was exactly why he was in trouble despite the seemingly favorable circumstances. , The source argued recent foreign-policy issues, including the rise of the jihadist group Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL), have made Republican voters more eager for a candidate who will \"assert\" himself on the global stage. Specifically, the person suggested the electorate was less inclined to favor noninterventionism than it was in 2012, when Pauls father, former congressman Ron Paul, made a splash in the GOP primary and built himself a base with a libertarian-leaning campaign. , \"Hehasa threshold question he has to answer,\" the source said of Paul. \"Republican primary voters understand the world is a much more dangerous place than it was four years ago; they feel like this president has putour nation and allies in a muchweaker position, and want to nominate a candidate who will strengthen and assert Americas position both at home and abroad.\", The source suggested the main challenge for Paul would be whether he could change his brand on this front. , \"The question is whether Rand can recast himself,\" the source said. \"The national security piece is ahuge hurdle forhimin a Republican primary.\", , Join the conversation about this story , See Also:]", "Date": "20150127", "Title": "[Here's Why Rand Paul Might Be The Front Runner In The 2016 GOP Primary]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/default/article/Here-s-Why-Rand-Paul-Might-Be-The-Front-Runner-6045412.php", "Author": "[Colin Campbell, provided by]"}

Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) unveiled a formal declaration of war against the jihadist group Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL) on Monday morning. , In a statement,Pauls office said he would introduce the resolution declaring war on ISIS when the Senate begins its next session in December. , Paul, a libertarian-oriented conservative looking at a 2016 presidential bid, is among those who have repeatedly argued President Barack Obama has overstepped his constitutional authority by not having Congress authorize the US fight against the jihadists in Syria and Iraq. Instead, the White House has relied on resolutions passed by Congress in 2001 and 2002 that authorized the use of force in Iraq and Afghanistan. In addition to declaring war on ISIS, Pauls resolution would terminate the 2002 authorization of military force in Iraq and set an expiration date for the 2001 resolution that applied to Afghanistan. , The White House has argued the earlier authorizations of military force can still be used since they were aimed at Al Qaeda, which was a forerunner to ISIS. , Pauls resolution wasfirst reported by The New York Times on Sunday night. His office released the full text in its statement on Monday morning. In it, Paul cited several founding fathers to bolster his arguments. , \"Whereas President George Washington, who presided over the Constitutional Convention, lectured: The Constitution vests the power of declaring war with Congress. Therefore no offensive expedition of importance can be undertaken until after they have deliberated upon the subject, and authorized such a measure,\" the resolution declared. , Both the Obama administration and Paul have faced accusations of flip-flopping in the fight against the Islamic State. Obama, who vowed to withdraw troops from Iraq, has nevertheless gradually expanded the US militarys role in the effort to battle ISIS in both that country and Syria. Meanwhile, Paul has sent mixed signals about how much whether he supports any the US military intervention in the region and whether Obama is at fault for the growth of jihadist militants there. , Paul told the Times the war authorization issue should be a rallying point for conservative critics of the Obama administration. , \"Conservatives are mad at him about immigration. And theyre mad about him using executive authority on Obamacare,\" Paul said. \"But this is another example where he doesnt have much respect for Congress, and some conservatives dont quite get that.\", View Pauls full resolution below:, Whereas Article I, section 8, of the United States Constitution provides, The Congress shall have the Power to . . . declare war;, Whereas President George Washington, who presided over the Constitutional Convention, lectured: The Constitution vests the power of declaring war with Congress.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) announced on Monday that he would run for US president in 2016, but the firebrand senator may still face questions about whether hes legally eligible to enter the White House. , Cruz was born in Alberta, Canada, to an American mother and Cuban-born father. This meant he acquired both US and Canadian citizenship at birth. , After his meteoric rise to national fame when he was elected to the Senate in 2012, he has been dogged by claims he is ineligible to become commander-in-chief since the Constitution states \"no person except a natural born citizen\" is eligible to assume the office of president. , Given the publicity over \"the birthers\"  the movement that alleged President Barack Obama was actually born abroad and claims he forged his birth certificate to list Hawaii as his birthplace  Cruz is likely to be a target of similar claims. , However, in 2013, constitutional experts told PolitiFact that the term \"natural born citizen\" isnt explicitly defined by the constitution and the Supreme Court has never ruled on the issue to clarify. , Since his mother was an American citizen, the experts said they expected Cruz would be deemed an American citizen at birth and thus pass the eligibility test, even though there is what Politifact described as \"the tiniest sliver of uncertainty\" his birthplace could derail his White House dreams. This little bit of doubt is due to the fact the term \"natural born citizen\" is vaguely defined. , \"Unfortunately, we cannot say for sure without either a definitive Supreme Court ruling, or an amendment to clarify the Constitution,\" a citizenship expert and law professor at Catholic University professor Sarah H. Duggin said. , Cruzs team did not respond to request about for comment on the issue.

{"Content": "[Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is framing his presidential campaign as part of a conservative crusade against the \"mushy middle\" of Republican politics. , But his more immediate foes are on the right. , While former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) has increasingly been dubbed the front-runner in the race, hes not Cruzs main concern in the GOP primary. While Bush and another top GOP contender, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, are clearly appealing to relatively moderate Republicans, Cruz is hoping to grab staunchly conservative voters who may be inclined to back a hardline candidate as an alternative. , However, Cruz isnt the only top-tier candidate aiming at becoming the Bush alternative to this segment of the electorate in the Republican primary. , Another likely hopeful, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (R), is also moving to run to the right of Bush and New Jersey Gov Chris Christie (R). But Rubios voting record is still to the left of some of the candidates who will really be fighting for the most conservative voters in the primary, including Cruz, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky), and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R). , With Cruz likely in most direct competition with Paul and Walker, some have interpreted the timing of his presidential campaign announcement as a shot across Pauls bow. The Daily Beast argued that Cruz was trying to upstage Paul, who is expected to launch his bid in April. , \"[T]heres a sense of mischievousness to Cruzs timing: Advisers close to Paul leaked a presidential campaign launch date in the first week of April. By announcing Monday, Cruz becomes the first Republican candidate formally running for his partys presidential nominationallowing him a couple weeks of peerless press and fundraising. It is hard to imagine this as an accident,\" The Daily Beasts Tim Mak wrote. , The New York Times reported Cruzs announcement was \"particularly\" aimed at taking public attention away from Walker (R), who has surged to become another leading White House contender in recent polling. Walker is popular among Republican activists, partially thanks to his high-profile battles against his states public-sector unions. , \"In multiple meetings since January, Mr. Cruzs advisers discussed Mr. Walkers effort to win support from both the center-right and more conservative wings of the party,\" The Times Jonathan Martin and Maggie Haberman wrote. \"Witnessing Mr. Walkers early boomlet, along with some of the Wisconsin governors initial stumbles, prompted Mr. Cruz to announce early, ahead of the other hopefuls in both parties, the Republicans briefed on his strategy said.\", Additionally, the venue of Cruzs announcement is a sign that the senator will be making a serious play for the religious right and socially conservative voters wary of Pauls libertarian positions. Cruz made his candidacy official at Liberty University, which bills itself as \"the largest Christian university in the world\" and was founded by the late evangelical pastor Jerry Fallwell. Evangelical Christian voters have an outsize influence in Iowa and other states that play a crucial early role in the presidential primary race. , Cruzs speech at Liberty was heavy on references to religion. He began by detailing his familys history and how his parents did not have a \"personal relationship with Jesus\" and were \"drinking far too much\" and \"living a fast life\" in his early childhood. Cruz said this culminated in his father leaving him and his mother only to return after becoming a Christian. , \"There are people who wonder if faith is real,\" he said at one point. \"I can tell you, in my family there is not a second of doubt. Because were it not for the transformative love of Jesus Christ, I would have been  raised by a single mom without my father in the house.\", Cruz went on to say he is focused on helping people experience the \"promise of America.\", \"For so many Americans, the promise of America seems more and more distant,\" Cruz said. \"What is the promise of America? The idea that  the revolutionary idea that this country was founded upon, which is that our rights they dont come from man. They come from god almighty.\", Cruz then detailed a series of policies that he said would help achieve this goal. They were all red meat for the conservative base and religious voters including repealing Obamacare, securing the borders, upholding \"the sacrament of marriage,\" fighting gun control, fighting for \"the sanctity of human life,\" and pushing to make \"school choice the civil rights issue of the next generation.\", He concluded by making it very clear he believes his support will come from staunch conservatives  whom he called \"a grassroots army.\", \"I believe god isnt done with America yet,\" Cruz said, adding, \"I believe in the power of millions of courageous conservatives rising up to reignite the promise of America.

Perry, a potential 2016 presidential candidate who spent much of the speech castigating ISIS after the group brutallyexecuted an American journalist earlier this week, said there was \"a very real\" risk they were already inside the U.S. , \"Theres the obvious great concern that because of the condition of the border from the standpoint of it not being secure and us not knowing who is penetrating across, that individuals from ISIS or other terrorist states could be [crossing the border]  and I think there is a very real possibility that they may have already used that,\" he said. , One reason it wouldnt be surprising for ISIS to use the U.S. border as an entry point, Perry said, was the \"historic\" level of individuals crossing the border from \"from countries with terrorist ties.\" He cited migrants from Ukraine  which, as PolitiFact has previously noted, \"is not a country with strong terrorist ties\"  to make his point. , \"There is I think great concern that the border between the United States and Mexico is insecure.
