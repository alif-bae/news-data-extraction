{"Content": "[ The Texas Supreme Court on Friday issued an opinion that the city of Houston did not adequately describe the charges associated with the drainage fee piece of ReBuild Houston, which voters narrowly approved in 2010, a ruling that reverses a Court of Appeals decision and kicks the case back to trial court. A lawsuit filed bya group of citizens affiliated with state Sen. Paul Bettencourt, R-Houston, shortly after the 2010 election charged that the citys ballot language was misleading and that at least two procedural steps were not followed, making the charter amendment illegal. The city prevailed in a motion for summary judgment, a decision the 14th Court of Appeals upheld in 2012. But in a decision delivered by Justice John Devine on Friday, the states highest court found that summary judgment was based on a flawed standard:, \"The city did not adequately describe the chief features  the character and purpose  of thecharter amendment on the ballot. By omitting the drainage charges, it failed to substantially submit the measure with such definiteness and certainty that voters would not be misled.\", The drainage fee is one of four funding sources that feeds ReBuild Houston, a program that Mayor Annise Parker pushed to pour billions into street and drainage repairs over two decades . The program is based on the idea of using data to prioritize projects on a \"worst-first\" basis in hopes of eliminating politics from the scheduling of the costly projects.]", "Date": "20150612", "Author": "[By Katherine Driessen]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/houston/article/Texas-Supreme-Court-rules-against-city-in-ReBuild-6323501.php", "Title": "[Texas Supreme Court sends ReBuild lawsuit back to trial court]"}
