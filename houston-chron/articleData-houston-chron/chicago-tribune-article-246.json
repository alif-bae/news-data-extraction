AUSTIN -- Texas officials expressed disappointment with the U.S. Supreme Courts decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act on Thursday, with Attorney General Ken Paxton calling it \"unfortunate news\" and Gov. Greg Abbott accusing Americas highest court of abandoning the Constitution. \"The Supreme Court abandoned the Constitution to resuscitate a failing healthcare law,\" Abbott said in a statement shortly after the 6-3 ruling came down from Washington. \"Todays action underscores why it is now more important than ever to ensure we elect a President who will repeal Obamacare and enact real healthcare reforms.\", A former Texas attorney general and state Supreme Court justice, Abbott, a Republican, wrote an op-ed in National Review magazine earlier this week saying the health insurance subsidies in President Obamas signature health law were \"obviously\" illegal because they were not spelled out in the text of the law. The states current attorney general, Paxton, who is also a Republican, said in a longer statement that the Affordable Care Act \"remains one of the broadest overreaches of federal authority in our nations history and we must continue to call on our leaders in Washington to step up and put an end to this job-killing law.\", Democratic legislative leaders celebrated the ruling, which will allow more than 800,000 Texans residents to keep receiving an average of $250 worth of subsidies toward insurance. \"I couldnt be more pleased with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling to continue tax credits that help Americans subsidize the cost of health insurance,\" said Sen. Sylvia Garcia, D-Houston. The reactions highlighted the differences in how Republicans and Democrats view the controversial 2010 health care law. While Paxton said the ruling was \"unfortunate news for the millions of Americans who have experienced first-hand the devastating effects Obamacare has had on their families and businesses,\" Democratic state Sen. Rodney Ellis of Houston said the court \"did the right thing by protecting the millions of Americans who have secured more affordable health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\", Democrat Donna Howard, an Austin state representative, said she hoped the ruling would inspired the Texas Legislature to fully embrace the Affordable Care Act by choosing to expand Medicaid. \"Lets finally put politics aside, and do whats best for the health and well-being of our community,\" Howard said in a statement. Texas business and health industry groups also called for more action while praising the ruling. \"With more than 1 million Texans purchasing private health insurance coverage through the federal marketplace, Texas hospitals can breathe a sigh of relief now that the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of Burwell,\" said Ted Shaw, president of the Texas Hospital Association, in a statement. \"Texas still leads the nation in the number of uninsured and we have significant work to do to increase access to coverage. But there is little doubt that hospitals financial challenges would be even greater if more than 1 million Texans were added to the rolls of uninsured.\"]", "Date": "20150625", "Author": "[By Brian M.
