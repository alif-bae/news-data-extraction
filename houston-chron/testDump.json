Sixteen-year-old Adrian Madrigal was on his way to visit a friend in early May when he was inexplicably gunned down, left to die in the street less than a mile from his home in northeast Houston. Four and a half months later, the senseless killing remains unsolved, with no concrete suspects or motives. But family and investigators renewed their search for answers Sunday, organizing an early morning canvassing of the neighborhood and offering a $15,000 reward for information leading to an arrest or charges. Starting at 7 a.m. dozens of friends and family members, some coming from as far away as Brownsville, stationed themselves on a median at the intersection of Mesa and Tidwell, holding up posters reading \"Who killed Adrian?\" and \"Justice for Adrian.\" Fanning out in a 1-mile radius of the crime scene, volunteers handed out fliers with Adrians picture and a summary of the night he died to cars stopped at red lights and taped them on local buildings. \"Were not going to give up until we find somebody,\" said Hector Madrigal, Adrians father. \"Somebodys going to come up.\", Early on the morning of May 6, Adrian drove his fathers car, a 2007 black GMC Yukon, along the 8900 block of Burl Street. A witness in the neighborhood allegedly heard a single gunshot around 1:15 a.m. and saw a man speeding away in a white four-door sedan. Minutes later, the witness saw someone driving what appeared to be the Madrigals car, found six hours later in a wooded area at the dead end of the 8200 block of Snowden Street. Adrian was found lying in the middle of the street with a gunshot wound to his head. The quiet residential road, populated with small ranch homes, is just feet from a community center and A.G. Hilliard Elementary School. A large wooden cross and a framed picture of an angel mark the spot where he died. After completing their initial investigation, authorities remain stumped. The only discernible motive was a carjacking, though the car was quickly abandoned. \"We just want to keep it fresh on peoples minds and renew the search for some sort of information,\" said Mark Coleman, an investigator with HPD homicide who helped canvass. \"We cant do this alone. We need the publics help.\", Investigators have pulled surveillance video from the area near where the Madrigal familys car was dumped that they hope will show the suspects, Coleman said. After the video is processed, authorities may release it to the public. Adrians death has shaken the sleepy neighborhood. Many knew the teen, who frequently rode his skateboard through the area. \"This is someone that was innocent, in the prime of his life, very young, and he was shot down in cold blood and left in the middle of the street,\" Coleman said. \"Thats very heart-wrenching and very upsetting to the neighborhood. If that can happen to him, that can happen to anyone.\", Adrians family describes him as a happy teenager who loved being outside. He attended Houston Can Academy, a charter school where he received good grades and was \"loved by all his teachers,\" said 13-year-old Perla Grimaldo, a family friend.

The team, which exceeded all expectations early in the season, is in epic fail mode. Its playoff hopes are flickering. Though the future is bright, the past also took a gut-punch. Two of the Astros legendary play-by-play radio voices have this month gone to that broadcast box in the sky. Gene Elston, who called games from 1962 through 1986, passed away on Sept. 5. Milo Hamilton, with the Astros from 1985 through, 2012, died Thursday. These men - one eloquent, the other enthusiastic - painted verbal pictures for generations of fans and are each rightly enshrined in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. (Thumbs down) Austin may be considered an enlightened town, but that wasnt evident when the University of Texas fired its athletic director early in the week. Heres how the New York Times framed it: \"In parting ways with its athletic director and naming an interim replacement, Texas neglected a qualified woman in its athletic department and highlighted a lack of female representation in Division I sports.\", , (Thumbs down)Instead of congratulating a 14-year-old for his STEM wizardry, Irving police busted Ahmed Mohamed for bringing a homemade clock to school to show his engineering teacher. The cops thought it was a hoax bomb. Wed hope that local law enforcement, on calls like this, would know to hit the snooze button.

{"Content": "[Caption, Close, The orange sky of sunrise is captured behind the skyline of Washington, Tuesday, Sept. 8, 2015, on the first day back to work for the U.S. Congress after their summer recess. (AP Photo/J. David Ake), Students getting used to the new school year should be thankful they dont have Congress schedule. Summer recess just ended and the first big test is at the end of the month - Sept. 30 marks the due date to pass a budget or face a government shutdown. Also on that to-do list: address the upcoming debt ceiling, vote on the Iran Nuclear Deal, reauthorize the Federal Aviation Act, debate crude oil exports, fix the Highway Trust Fund and the Social Security disability trust fund and hopefully renew the Import-Export Bank charter. Theres also a visit from Pope Francis. Given that Congress scheduled only 10 work days through the end of the month, congressional observers have placed their bets on our elected officials knocking only two items off the list before September ends. The House and Senate are scheduled to vote next week on the Iran deal, which stands as the best current option for preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Also, a continuing resolution will probably be used to delay any major budgetary changes for another day. Really, that only addresses one-and-a-half issues, but some politicians would rather see that number sit at zero. Over the summer recess, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz wrote a letter to Senate leadership stating that he would \"oppose any government funding legislation that would authorize or provide federal funds for Planned Parenthood.\", Cruz may find himself standing alone in this fight. His senior partner in the Senate, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, said Tuesday that shutting down the government over Planned Parenthood would be a mistake. \"That would set the pro-life cause back, in my view,\" Cornyn said, according to Politico. Politico also reports that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. lacks the 60 votes necessary to advance the sort of bill that could strip Planned Parenthood funding from the budget. One poll even shows that nearly 70 percent of Americans oppose a government shutdown over the issue. But political failure doesnt mean Cruz cant win in another way. When Cruz tried this shut-down strategy in a fight over the Affordable Care Act in 2013, it didnt turn out too well for his Republican colleagues. The party hit a record low in approval polls. Nor did Cruz help the nation as a whole, which suffered a $20 billion economic hit from the 16-day shutdown, according to Moodys Analytics. And in the end, the Affordable Care Act remained on the books. However, one man came out on top: Ted Cruz. Fundraising skyrocketed for Texas junior senator, who made headlines with his 21-hour speech on the Senate floor. You may remember the part where he read \"Green Eggs and Ham\" by Dr. Seuss. Our nation faces serious challenges at home and abroad, and the senators hoping to lead our nation as president may be tempted to look at Cruzs personal success in the last government shutdown as a model for raising money and garnering attention in a crowded field. But as Speaker Sam Rayburn once said, with his famous Texan bluntness, any jackass can kick down a barn. A truly impressive presidential candidate would actually get the gears of government turning and help usher through a new federal budget that reduces long-term debt while fully funding government services. But so far, nobody seems up to it. Its back to school season, and Congress could stand to show that it still remembers civics class. ]", "Date": "20150910", "Title": "[Editorial: Congress has work to do]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/editorials/article/Congress-has-work-to-do-6497083.php", "Author": "NULL"}

SALT LAKE CITY (AP)  Seven avid hikers in safety helmets, wetsuits and climbing harnesses smiled for a group photo before heading into the mouth of a narrow canyon in Zion National Park in Utah. The 50-something men and women from California and Nevada posed with their arms around each other before trying to climb and swim through the popular sandstone gorge. Days later, rescuers searching for their bodies found a camera revealing the final group photo. Hours after they entered Keyhole Canyon, dark skies unleashed fierce rains that sent water surging through the chasm, sweeping the seven people to their deaths Monday. The last body was found Thursday  the same day authorities recovered a 33-year-old man killed by flash flooding near the Utah-Arizona border, raising the death toll to 20 from the violent rainstorm. At least 12 other people, including nine children, died in a nearby polygamous town when two cars were swept away. A 6-year-old boy was still missing. Some of the seven hikers took a canyoneering skills course just before the excursion, park officials said. Some also knew each other through a hiking club in Valencia, California. The photo was taken on a \"tragic last adventure\" for the group who regularly hiked and backpacked, the children of victims Linda and Steve Arthur, of Camarillo, California, said in a statement. Steve Arthur, 58, was a sergeant and 21-year veteran of the Ventura County Sheriffs Department, Capt. John Reilly said. Arthur was awarded the Medal of Valor in 1998 for rescuing a man from a burning car. \"If he wasnt at work, he was out with his kids or grandkids, hiking all the time,\" Reilly said. Arthur was excited about the trip and boasted about getting the permits for Keyhole Canyon, which only 80 people a day are allowed to visit. \"He was fortunate he was with the love of his life  his wife  they were both excited about going on these trips,\" Commander Monica McGrath said. Mark MacKenzie, 56, of Valencia also looked out for others, particularly in the outdoors, said his mother Deanna MacKenzie Sisung. \"Hed carry a watermelon in his backpack, and hed usually be the first one up there, and hed serve everybody,\" Sisung said of MacKenzie, who had three children. Don Teichner, 55, of Mesquite, Nevada, met members of the group through a California hiking club. The father and grandfather was an executive at his familys Los Angeles-based garment-dyeing company, said cousin Jeff Teichner. Gary Favela, 51, of Rancho Cucamonga, California, was adventurous and had a love for canyoneering, his family said in a statement. Muku Reynolds, 59, of Chino, California, was a doting grandmother and active in many Meetup.com hiking groups, spending nearly every weekend outdoors, said Graham Willis, 32, who met her in one such group and summited Mount Whitney with her last summer. He said Reynolds, who grew up in Japan, was known for collecting heart-shaped rocks along trails. Reynolds had been canyoneering in Zion three years ago with a guide, said Kathryn Burrows, 54, who hikes with her and took a canyoneering course with her back then. The pair went on a five-day group backpacking trip in Kings Canyon National Park just last month and talked about celebrating Reynolds 60th birthday by hiking Machu Picchu in Peru. \"She knew those guys, she has hiked with that club a lot,\" Reynolds said. \"People really trust each other.\", Robin Brum, 53, a wife and mother from Camarillo, was a selfless person who cared for those around her, her family said. \"She leaves a hole in our hearts and our lives that will never be filled,\" a statement said. Park officials say they warned the group when they got their permit that there was a 40 percent chance of rain and flash flooding. Rangers give similar warnings nearly every day during the rainy season. Park policy prevents rangers from assessing visitors skills or stopping them from entering canyons. Zion is investigating what led to the deaths and reviewing its policies, but the process for canyon entry permits is decided at the national level, park spokesman David Eaker said. Rangers closed the canyons after the storm hit, but there was no way to warn those already inside the majestic slot formations that can quickly fill with rain water and leave people with no escape. The children of Steve and Linda Arthur said their parents were extremely cautious and had been watching weather reports closely. They texted family for updates before they headed into the canyon, but they didnt get cellphone service at the trailhead. \"This is nothing but a freak accident and a true case of being at the wrong place at the wrong time,\" the couples children said.

{"Content": "[Caption, Close, A family of four, including children between ages 4 and 7, were killed after a three-vehicle accident Sunday along Texas 105 in Conroe. A 68-year-old man faces intoxication manslaughter charges after a grisly crash killed a family of four Sunday afternoon near Lake Conroe  adding to the troubling tally of deadly driving deaths in Montgomery County. Ronald Cooper, of Montgomery, faces four counts of intoxication manslaughter and two counts of intoxication assault for his role in a three-vehicle wreck at 12:46 p.m. along Texas 105 near Marina Drive, right in front of Conroe Fire Station No. 6. The victims were two adults and two children, between the ages of 4 and 7, riding together in a vehicle left unrecognizable by the force of the crash. Two teenagers in a different vehicle were injured, as was Cooper, who was arrested after the accident at a local hospital, police said. \"It was just a horrific tragedy,\" Montgomery County Precinct 1 Justice of the Peace Wayne Mack said. \"Just a terrible, horrific tragedy.\", The incident marks the first intoxication manslaughter charges filed since before Memorial Day in Montgomery County, where law enforcement have stepped up efforts to combat drunken-driving deaths. Sarah Jones, a resident of the neighborhood across the highway from Sundays crash site, said she often hears about crashes along this stretch of Texas 105, which has several bars along it. \"This is all too frequent in this area,\" Jones said. \"People come to visit the lake and hit the bars and then drive. Its just irresponsibility. ... I dont bring my kids out after dark. ... Now, with this happening during the day ... its never safe to go out.\", Montgomery County was the site of several serious head-on, drunken-driving wrecks, including two crashes that killed five people on Interstate 45 in a 48-hour stretch in the summer of 2012. In the first, a 24-year-old Spring woman attempted to drive home from a bar where she allegedly had drunk four beers and 17 shots. In the second incident, a National Guard recruiter killed three after he drove after allegedly drinking 22 beers. The accidents were among those that made Montgomery County the 10th-highest area in the state for alcohol-related driving deaths. Those numbers have declined from at least a dozen such cases a few years ago to four in 2014, partly because of an intense crackdown this summer. For the 100 days between Memorial Day and Labor Day, statistically the period with the highest likelihood of drunken driving crashes, stepped-up patrols and tightened blood-alcohol testing led to 643 arrests. Also during that period, not a single charge of intoxication manslaughter was filed, authorities said. According to public records, Cooper also was arrested in 2008 on DWI charges. Police didnt provide an account of where Cooper was headed at the time of Sundays wreck or any details of the collision that left a blue Jeep with its front left side crushed; another, rolled over twisted metal that once was a sedan; and a third car with minor damage to the front right side. The children killed were back-seat passengers, and the adults  a man and a woman  were in the front seat. Everyone in the vehicle was wearing proper safety restraints, Conroe Police Sgt. Dorcy Riddle said. The two teenagers riding in another vehicle were treated and released from a local hospital, Mack said. The crash, which remains under investigation, closed all eastbound lanes and all but one westbound lane of Texas 105 at Lake Conroe for several hours.

Greeks were voting Sunday in their third national polls this year, called on to choose who they trust to steer the country into its new international bailout. ATHENS, Greece (AP)  Greeks were voting Sunday in their third national polls this year, called on to choose who they trust to steer the country into its new international bailout. Former Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras left-wing Syriza party, which made pledges to implement austerity measures in return for billions of euros in rescue loans, was marginally ahead of the rival center-right New Democracy in opinion polls leading up to the vote. But the polls, which showed many of the 9.9 million voters were undecided until two days before the vote or might abstain altogether, indicated the winner would not have enough votes to form a government alone. Tsipras, 41, triggered the election by resigning barely seven months into his four-year term, after facing a rebellion within Syriza over his policy U-turn in accepting the spending cuts and tax hikes stipulated by the bailout. Tsipras had won January elections on pledges of abolishing such measures, tied to Greeces first two bailouts. He has argued he had no choice but to accept the demands of European creditors for more tax hikes and spending cuts in return for Greeces third rescue, a three-year package worth 86 billion euros ($97 billion). He had vowed to repeal the measures imposed in return for the countrys first two bailouts  and despite winning a referendum he hastily called July 5 urging Greeks to reject creditor reform proposals. But without the third bailout, Greece  which has relied on international rescue loans since 2010  faced bankruptcy and a potentially disastrous exit from Europes joint currency. The campaign has been lackluster and somewhat muted  a far cry from the frenetic, high-stakes January campaign, which pitted the anti-bailout Tsipras against centrist parties that argued the deal with other Eurozone countries was the countrys best chance for an eventual return to some form of economic normalcy in a country ravaged by recession and with unemployment at around 25 percent. Now, the policies for whichever party wins have already been set in the form of the bailout agreement. The campaign of Tsipras main rival, New Democracys 61-year-old Vangelis Meimarakis, has centered on a return to stability. He painted Tsipras as a reckless, inexperienced politician who led the country toward a potential catastrophe and introduced strict banking restrictions in an effort to stem a bank run. Syrizas campaign has focused on doing away with the staid and often corrupt politics of the past. The government that emerges will have little time to waste. Creditors are expected to review progress of reforms as part of the bailout next month, while the government will also have to draft the 2016 state budget, overhaul the pension system, raise a series of taxes, including on farmers, carry out privatizations and merge social security funds. It must also oversee a critical bank recapitalization program, without which depositors with over 100,000 euros ($113,000) in their accounts will be forced to contribute. Polls have indicated no party is anywhere near the levels needed for an overall parliamentary majority of 151 seats in the 300-member legislature, even with the 50-seat bonus given to the winner, and a three-party coalition would likely be required. That should be achievable with help from two centrist pro-European small parties: the formerly mighty socialist PASOK, and relative newcomer To Potami, or The River. The Nazi-inspired extreme-right Golden Dawn party has been consistently polling in third place, but would not be approached by any of the other parties to form a coalition. A total of nine parties have a chance of reaching the 3 percent threshold needed to enter parliament. Polls close at 7 p.m. (1600 GMT) and final results are expected by early Monday.]", "Date": "20150920", "Title": "[Greeks vote once more in early elections]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/world/article/Greeks-vote-once-more-in-early-elections-6516990.php\n", "Author": null}
{"Content": "[Caption, Close, , Ahmed Mohamed stands in handcuffs at Irving police department. Scary-looking, Regarding \"Obama: Cool clock, Ahmed\" (Page A1, Thursday), I was alarmed that the student who brought a \"clock\" to school is talking of racial bias. The fact is, he brought a contraption that was unidentifiable, in a box and wired. I believe it showed poor judgment. I was also alarmed that the school and police force are being criticized for taking preemptive measures to assure the safety of other students and school officials. I think we can all agree, that this device looked more like a bomb than a clock and in todays world, no one can be too careful. Mary Hill, Houston, , Knee-jerk, Regarding \"Obama: Cool clock, Ahmed\" (Page A1, Thursday), in an ironic twist, it seems racist to assume this had anything to do with race or religion. As sad as it is, school shootings, bomb threats and hoaxes are all too common these days. Because of this, no one is allowed to bring a weapon, or anything that even resembles one, on school property. It would have been racist if authorities had assumed that since he was Muslim, he had ties to ISIS. But, they accused him of making \"a movie bomb or hoax device.\" Thats an accusation that could be used toward any child in America whos been raised watching Hollywood movies and TV shows, and shows up with something suspicious at school. School authorities have a duty to abide by the \"better safe than sorry\" adage, because they are responsible for the safety of all the children at school. Ahmed was treated as we hope he would be treated: Just like any other child with a suspicious object. Hundreds of kids are sent home from school each year for having a weapon or something potentially threatening, playing a prank, creating a hoax, etc. This got turned into a firestorm of racism because of the unfortunate coincidence that, in this case, the child was Muslim.  , Susan Ellis Brittain, Houston, Overkill, I find it deplorable that Ahmed had to go through arrest, handcuffs, interrogation by intimidating officers, and a 3-day suspension -  all because of ignorance on the part of his school and the police. The police departments ignorance of bombs speaks poorly about the level of training they have received. At the very least, the bomb squad could have been summoned before Ahmed was punished wrongly. Lets demand that common sense be applied to such situations instead of a knee-jerk reaction against an intelligent student: we need such students, and I hope this experience wont squelch his creativity. Ross Bonny, Spring, , Proper action, The authorities did exactly what they should have done. This clock could just as well have been a mock run to see what would happen.

{"Content": "[Caption, Close, Pope Francis, Pilgrims hold up their hands to be blessed by Pope Francis during a Mass in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Latin Americas first pope is due to arrive in the United States on Tuesday. The first Latin American pope will soon arrive in \"gringolandia\" for a six-day apostolic visit - his first to the U.S. as pontiff. Pope Francis visit, which starts in Washington on Tuesday before proceeding to New York and Philadelphia, has officially been scheduled to coincide with the celebration of the World Meeting of Families. As has been widely reported, Francis will also address the UN General Assembly on climate change. For Hispanic Catholics, however, the most significant part of the visit may lie elsewhere, in the popes symbolically key visit to Our Lady Queen of Angels School in East Harlem, a Catholic school whose student population is 70 percent Latino and 22 percent black. Francis presence at the school represents a public show of papal concern for the more socially and economically vulnerable members of U.S. society, many of whom are young Catholic Hispanics. But it is also a wake-up call for the U.S. Church to involve itself more actively in the everyday realities of Hispanics lives because the future of the Catholic Church in the U.S. will itself be increasingly Hispanic. The school visit is even more significant in light of Francis recent protests (May encyclical letter Laudato Si) against the global economic inequalities that have led to what he called a \"tragic rise\" in the number of migrants fleeing poverty worldwide. On Wall Street, Francis will use his visit to place at center stage a disadvantaged, largely Hispanic school community of migrant origin. This approach marks a clear departure from the papacy of John Paul II, a more conservative pope for whom Hispanic and Latin American Catholics were key pieces in a global fight against communism. In contrast, Francis has chosen to highlight the marginalization and uprootedness that are experienced by many Hispanics largely as a result of the global economic model endorsed by the U.S. More than this, Francis believes that the continued exclusion of poorer Hispanics from fuller social and economic participation in the U.S. degrades America. In Washington, Francis will canonize the 18th century Franciscan missionary Junpero Serra, the \"Apostle of California,\" during a Mass in the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. Serra toiled among the indigenous Pame people in Mexico after arriving from Spain. He then spent 15 years in California, founding missions at San Diego, San Francisco and elsewhere before his death in 1784. What possible relevance does the canonization of an obscure migrant saint have in 2015? According to Francis, Serra should be seen as \"one of the founding fathers of the United States\" by virtue of his missionary zeal and protection of his indigenous and Hispanic flock. By following his legacy, Francis has said, \"may all Americans rediscover their own dignity and unite themselves ever more closely to Christ and his Church.\", The force of language is striking. Francis is saying that the denial of dignity to Hispanics is not merely wrong, but wrong because it compromises the dignity of all Americans. Since it is unlikely that Francis visit will lead to sudden conversions among world policy makers over climate change, it may be that its greatest impact is felt in his call for greater recognition of migrants humanity. Francis is clearly priming American Catholics to take a stronger position on questions such as migration reform and the social inclusion of Hispanics. As the U.S. Catholic Church becomes ever more Hispanic, while Hispanics themselves become more diverse in their religious choices, Francis is making a renewed pitch for the spiritual loyalties of migrant communities. And that might just be the most impactful message of this papal trip - a very public recognition by Francis of the individual identity of Hispanics, the problems that they face and their value to the Church. , Butler is an associate professor of modern Mexican history and is also affiliated with the Department of Religious Studies in the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Texas at Austin. ]", "Date": "20150919", "Title": "[Butler: Pope visit puts U.S. relationship with Latinos front and center]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Butler-Pope-visit-puts-U-S-relationship-with-6516196.php", "Author": null}
{"Content": "[Turkeys stock market is tumbling and the lira is down over 5% against the dollar Monday morning after President Recep Tayyip Erdoan suffered a huge setback in the countrys elections. Erdoans AKP has suffered its first fall in support in four elections after a new party representing minority Kurds in the country made huge inroads in Sundays polls. The result means Erdoan will probably be unable to form a majority government and will most likely have to form a coalition, possibly with Turkeys far-right party. Alternatively, fresh elections could be called within six weeks if no government can be formed. The uncertainty has sent investors heading for the hills. The Turkish stock market has opened down over 8%, and the Turkish lira is down over 5% against the dollar on the news, its worst one-day fall in seven years. Erdoans Justice & Development party (AKP) won 41% of the vote, compared with 49% in 2011 elections. But the new Kurdish HD party managed to capture 12% of the vote, uniting Kurds with liberal left-wingers in Turkey. The result is a blow not only for Erdoans party, but also for his ambition to consolidate his own power and move the Turkish government to a more presidential system. Erdoan, who has ruled for 13 years, campaigned with a view to convert Turkish government into a presidential system, rather than a parliamentary system. Voters have resoundingly rejected this vision.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP)  Seven avid hikers in safety helmets, wetsuits and climbing harnesses smiled for a group photo before heading into the mouth of a narrow canyon in Zion National Park in Utah. The 50-something men and women from California and Nevada posed with their arms around each other before trying to climb and swim through the popular sandstone gorge. Days later, rescuers searching for their bodies found a camera revealing the final group photo. Hours after they entered Keyhole Canyon, dark skies unleashed fierce rains that sent water surging through the chasm, sweeping the seven people to their deaths Monday. The last body was found Thursday  the same day authorities recovered a 33-year-old man killed by flash flooding near the Utah-Arizona border, raising the death toll to 20 from the violent rainstorm. At least 12 other people, including nine children, died in a nearby polygamous town when two cars were swept away. A 6-year-old boy was still missing. Some of the seven hikers took a canyoneering skills course just before the excursion, park officials said. Some also knew each other through a hiking club in Valencia, California. The photo was taken on a \"tragic last adventure\" for the group who regularly hiked and backpacked, the children of victims Linda and Steve Arthur, of Camarillo, California, said in a statement. Steve Arthur, 58, was a sergeant and 21-year veteran of the Ventura County Sheriffs Department, Capt. John Reilly said. Arthur was awarded the Medal of Valor in 1998 for rescuing a man from a burning car. \"If he wasnt at work, he was out with his kids or grandkids, hiking all the time,\" Reilly said. Arthur was excited about the trip and boasted about getting the permits for Keyhole Canyon, which only 80 people a day are allowed to visit. \"He was fortunate he was with the love of his life  his wife  they were both excited about going on these trips,\" Commander Monica McGrath said. Mark MacKenzie, 56, of Valencia also looked out for others, particularly in the outdoors, said his mother Deanna MacKenzie Sisung. \"Hed carry a watermelon in his backpack, and hed usually be the first one up there, and hed serve everybody,\" Sisung said of MacKenzie, who had three children. Don Teichner, 55, of Mesquite, Nevada, met members of the group through a California hiking club. The father and grandfather was an executive at his familys Los Angeles-based garment-dyeing company, said cousin Jeff Teichner. Gary Favela, 51, of Rancho Cucamonga, California, was adventurous and had a love for canyoneering, his family said in a statement. Muku Reynolds, 59, of Chino, California, was a doting grandmother and active in many Meetup.com hiking groups, spending nearly every weekend outdoors, said Graham Willis, 32, who met her in one such group and summited Mount Whitney with her last summer. He said Reynolds, who grew up in Japan, was known for collecting heart-shaped rocks along trails. Reynolds had been canyoneering in Zion three years ago with a guide, said Kathryn Burrows, 54, who hikes with her and took a canyoneering course with her back then. The pair went on a five-day group backpacking trip in Kings Canyon National Park just last month and talked about celebrating Reynolds 60th birthday by hiking Machu Picchu in Peru. \"She knew those guys, she has hiked with that club a lot,\" Reynolds said. \"People really trust each other.\", Robin Brum, 53, a wife and mother from Camarillo, was a selfless person who cared for those around her, her family said. \"She leaves a hole in our hearts and our lives that will never be filled,\" a statement said. Park officials say they warned the group when they got their permit that there was a 40 percent chance of rain and flash flooding. Rangers give similar warnings nearly every day during the rainy season. Park policy prevents rangers from assessing visitors skills or stopping them from entering canyons. Zion is investigating what led to the deaths and reviewing its policies, but the process for canyon entry permits is decided at the national level, park spokesman David Eaker said. Rangers closed the canyons after the storm hit, but there was no way to warn those already inside the majestic slot formations that can quickly fill with rain water and leave people with no escape. The children of Steve and Linda Arthur said their parents were extremely cautious and had been watching weather reports closely. They texted family for updates before they headed into the canyon, but they didnt get cellphone service at the trailhead. \"This is nothing but a freak accident and a true case of being at the wrong place at the wrong time,\" the couples children said.

{"Content": "[Caption, Close, A family of four, including children between ages 4 and 7, were killed after a three-vehicle accident Sunday along Texas 105 in Conroe. A 68-year-old man faces intoxication manslaughter charges after a grisly crash killed a family of four Sunday afternoon near Lake Conroe  adding to the troubling tally of deadly driving deaths in Montgomery County. Ronald Cooper, of Montgomery, faces four counts of intoxication manslaughter and two counts of intoxication assault for his role in a three-vehicle wreck at 12:46 p.m. along Texas 105 near Marina Drive, right in front of Conroe Fire Station No. 6. The victims were identified late Sunday as: Roland Sedlmeier, 49; Melinda Sedlmeier, 42; Harley Sedlmeier, 6; and Sofie Sedlmeier, 4, who were riding together in a Toyota Echo left unrecognizable by the force of the crash. Two teenagers  16- and 15-year-old boys  in a Jeep Wrangler were injured, as was Cooper, who was arrested after the accident at a local hospital, police said. \"It was just a horrific tragedy,\" Montgomery County Precinct 1 Justice of the Peace Wayne Mack said. \"Just a terrible, horrific tragedy.\", The incident marks the first intoxication manslaughter charges filed since before Memorial Day in Montgomery County, where law enforcement have stepped up efforts to combat drunken-driving deaths. Sarah Jones, a resident of the neighborhood across the highway from Sundays crash site, said she often hears about crashes along this stretch of Texas 105, which has several bars along it. \"This is all too frequent in this area,\" Jones said. \"People come to visit the lake and hit the bars and then drive. Its just irresponsibility. ... I dont bring my kids out after dark. ... Now, with this happening during the day ... its never safe to go out.\", A relative of Coopers told KHOU Sunday that he hadnt been drinking alcohol, but was taking a new prescription medicine to treat a blood clot recently found in his brain. Montgomery County was the site of several serious head-on, drunken-driving wrecks, including two crashes that killed five people on Interstate 45 in a 48-hour stretch in the summer of 2012. In the first, a 24-year-old Spring woman attempted to drive home from a bar where she allegedly had drunk four beers and 17 shots. In the second incident, a National Guard recruiter killed three after he drove after allegedly drinking 22 beers. The accidents were among those that made Montgomery County the 10th-highest area in the state for alcohol-related driving deaths. Those numbers have declined from at least a dozen such cases a few years ago to four in 2014, partly because of an intense crackdown this summer. For the 100 days between Memorial Day and Labor Day, statistically the period with the highest likelihood of drunken driving crashes, stepped-up patrols and tightened blood-alcohol testing led to 643 arrests. Also during that period, not a single charge of intoxication manslaughter was filed, authorities said. According to public records, Cooper also was arrested in 2008 on DWI charges. Police didnt provide an account of where Cooper was headed at the time of Sundays wreck. He was driving a 2011 Hyundai Axera westbound when he hit the back of the familys 2011 Toyota, causing it to spin into the eastbound lanes. The teens in the Jeep tried to avoind the crash, but struck the Toyotas right side. Both the Jeep and Toyota landed on their sides. Everyone in Sedlmeiers vehicle was wearing proper safety restraints, Conroe Police Sgt. Dorcy Riddle said. Roland Sedlmeier was a captain at TransCanada, according to his Linkedin profile.The crash, which remains under investigation, closed all eastbound lanes and all but one westbound lane of Texas 105 at Lake Conroe for several hours.

Greeks were voting Sunday in their third national polls this year, called on to choose who they trust to steer the country into its new international bailout. ATHENS, Greece (AP)  Greeks were voting Sunday in their third national polls this year, called on to choose who they trust to steer the country into its new international bailout. Former Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras left-wing Syriza party, which made pledges to implement austerity measures in return for billions of euros in rescue loans, was marginally ahead of the rival center-right New Democracy in opinion polls leading up to the vote. But the polls, which showed many of the 9.9 million voters were undecided until two days before the vote or might abstain altogether, indicated the winner would not have enough votes to form a government alone. Tsipras, 41, triggered the election by resigning barely seven months into his four-year term, after facing a rebellion within Syriza over his policy U-turn in accepting the spending cuts and tax hikes stipulated by the bailout. Tsipras had won January elections on pledges of abolishing such measures, tied to Greeces first two bailouts. He has argued he had no choice but to accept the demands of European creditors for more tax hikes and spending cuts in return for Greeces third rescue, a three-year package worth 86 billion euros ($97 billion). He had vowed to repeal the measures imposed in return for the countrys first two bailouts  and despite winning a referendum he hastily called July 5 urging Greeks to reject creditor reform proposals. But without the third bailout, Greece  which has relied on international rescue loans since 2010  faced bankruptcy and a potentially disastrous exit from Europes joint currency. The campaign has been lackluster and somewhat muted  a far cry from the frenetic, high-stakes January campaign, which pitted the anti-bailout Tsipras against centrist parties that argued the deal with other Eurozone countries was the countrys best chance for an eventual return to some form of economic normalcy in a country ravaged by recession and with unemployment at around 25 percent. Now, the policies for whichever party wins have already been set in the form of the bailout agreement. The campaign of Tsipras main rival, New Democracys 61-year-old Vangelis Meimarakis, has centered on a return to stability. He painted Tsipras as a reckless, inexperienced politician who led the country toward a potential catastrophe and introduced strict banking restrictions in an effort to stem a bank run. Syrizas campaign has focused on doing away with the staid and often corrupt politics of the past. The government that emerges will have little time to waste. Creditors are expected to review progress of reforms as part of the bailout next month, while the government will also have to draft the 2016 state budget, overhaul the pension system, raise a series of taxes, including on farmers, carry out privatizations and merge social security funds. It must also oversee a critical bank recapitalization program, without which depositors with over 100,000 euros ($113,000) in their accounts will be forced to contribute. Polls have indicated no party is anywhere near the levels needed for an overall parliamentary majority of 151 seats in the 300-member legislature, even with the 50-seat bonus given to the winner, and a three-party coalition would likely be required. That should be achievable with help from two centrist pro-European small parties: the formerly mighty socialist PASOK, and relative newcomer To Potami, or The River. The Nazi-inspired extreme-right Golden Dawn party has been consistently polling in third place, but would not be approached by any of the other parties to form a coalition. A total of nine parties have a chance of reaching the 3 percent threshold needed to enter parliament. Polls close at 7 p.m. (1600 GMT) and final results are expected by early Monday.]", "Date": "20150920", "Title": "[Greeks vote once more in early elections]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/world/article/Greeks-vote-once-more-in-early-elections-6516990.php\n", "Author": null}
{"Content": "[Caption, Close, , Ahmed Mohamed stands in handcuffs at Irving police department. Scary-looking, Regarding \"Obama: Cool clock, Ahmed\" (Page A1, Thursday), I was alarmed that the student who brought a \"clock\" to school is talking of racial bias. The fact is, he brought a contraption that was unidentifiable, in a box and wired. I believe it showed poor judgment. I was also alarmed that the school and police force are being criticized for taking preemptive measures to assure the safety of other students and school officials. I think we can all agree, that this device looked more like a bomb than a clock and in todays world, no one can be too careful. Mary Hill, Houston, , Knee-jerk, Regarding \"Obama: Cool clock, Ahmed\" (Page A1, Thursday), in an ironic twist, it seems racist to assume this had anything to do with race or religion. As sad as it is, school shootings, bomb threats and hoaxes are all too common these days. Because of this, no one is allowed to bring a weapon, or anything that even resembles one, on school property. It would have been racist if authorities had assumed that since he was Muslim, he had ties to ISIS. But, they accused him of making \"a movie bomb or hoax device.\" Thats an accusation that could be used toward any child in America whos been raised watching Hollywood movies and TV shows, and shows up with something suspicious at school. School authorities have a duty to abide by the \"better safe than sorry\" adage, because they are responsible for the safety of all the children at school. Ahmed was treated as we hope he would be treated: Just like any other child with a suspicious object. Hundreds of kids are sent home from school each year for having a weapon or something potentially threatening, playing a prank, creating a hoax, etc. This got turned into a firestorm of racism because of the unfortunate coincidence that, in this case, the child was Muslim.  , Susan Ellis Brittain, Houston, Overkill, I find it deplorable that Ahmed had to go through arrest, handcuffs, interrogation by intimidating officers, and a 3-day suspension -  all because of ignorance on the part of his school and the police. The police departments ignorance of bombs speaks poorly about the level of training they have received. At the very least, the bomb squad could have been summoned before Ahmed was punished wrongly. Lets demand that common sense be applied to such situations instead of a knee-jerk reaction against an intelligent student: we need such students, and I hope this experience wont squelch his creativity. Ross Bonny, Spring, , Proper action, The authorities did exactly what they should have done. This clock could just as well have been a mock run to see what would happen.

{"Content": "[Caption, Close, Pope Francis, Pilgrims hold up their hands to be blessed by Pope Francis during a Mass in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Latin Americas first pope is due to arrive in the United States on Tuesday. The first Latin American pope will soon arrive in \"gringolandia\" for a six-day apostolic visit - his first to the U.S. as pontiff. Pope Francis visit, which starts in Washington on Tuesday before proceeding to New York and Philadelphia, has officially been scheduled to coincide with the celebration of the World Meeting of Families. As has been widely reported, Francis will also address the UN General Assembly on climate change. For Hispanic Catholics, however, the most significant part of the visit may lie elsewhere, in the popes symbolically key visit to Our Lady Queen of Angels School in East Harlem, a Catholic school whose student population is 70 percent Latino and 22 percent black. Francis presence at the school represents a public show of papal concern for the more socially and economically vulnerable members of U.S. society, many of whom are young Catholic Hispanics. But it is also a wake-up call for the U.S. Church to involve itself more actively in the everyday realities of Hispanics lives because the future of the Catholic Church in the U.S. will itself be increasingly Hispanic. The school visit is even more significant in light of Francis recent protests (May encyclical letter Laudato Si) against the global economic inequalities that have led to what he called a \"tragic rise\" in the number of migrants fleeing poverty worldwide. On Wall Street, Francis will use his visit to place at center stage a disadvantaged, largely Hispanic school community of migrant origin. This approach marks a clear departure from the papacy of John Paul II, a more conservative pope for whom Hispanic and Latin American Catholics were key pieces in a global fight against communism. In contrast, Francis has chosen to highlight the marginalization and uprootedness that are experienced by many Hispanics largely as a result of the global economic model endorsed by the U.S. More than this, Francis believes that the continued exclusion of poorer Hispanics from fuller social and economic participation in the U.S. degrades America. In Washington, Francis will canonize the 18th century Franciscan missionary Junpero Serra, the \"Apostle of California,\" during a Mass in the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. Serra toiled among the indigenous Pame people in Mexico after arriving from Spain. He then spent 15 years in California, founding missions at San Diego, San Francisco and elsewhere before his death in 1784. What possible relevance does the canonization of an obscure migrant saint have in 2015? According to Francis, Serra should be seen as \"one of the founding fathers of the United States\" by virtue of his missionary zeal and protection of his indigenous and Hispanic flock. By following his legacy, Francis has said, \"may all Americans rediscover their own dignity and unite themselves ever more closely to Christ and his Church.\", The force of language is striking. Francis is saying that the denial of dignity to Hispanics is not merely wrong, but wrong because it compromises the dignity of all Americans. Since it is unlikely that Francis visit will lead to sudden conversions among world policy makers over climate change, it may be that its greatest impact is felt in his call for greater recognition of migrants humanity. Francis is clearly priming American Catholics to take a stronger position on questions such as migration reform and the social inclusion of Hispanics. As the U.S. Catholic Church becomes ever more Hispanic, while Hispanics themselves become more diverse in their religious choices, Francis is making a renewed pitch for the spiritual loyalties of migrant communities. And that might just be the most impactful message of this papal trip - a very public recognition by Francis of the individual identity of Hispanics, the problems that they face and their value to the Church. , Butler is an associate professor of modern Mexican history and is also affiliated with the Department of Religious Studies in the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Texas at Austin. ]", "Date": "20150919", "Title": "[Butler: Pope visit puts U.S. relationship with Latinos front and center]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Butler-Pope-visit-puts-U-S-relationship-with-6516196.php", "Author": null}

Erdoans AKP has suffered its first fall in support in four elections after a new party representing minority Kurds in the country made huge inroads in Sundays polls. The result means Erdoan will probably be unable to form a majority government and will most likely have to form a coalition, possibly with Turkeys far-right party. Alternatively, fresh elections could be called within six weeks if no government can be formed. The uncertainty has sent investors heading for the hills. The Turkish stock market has opened down over 8%, and the Turkish lira is down over 5% against the dollar on the news, its worst one-day fall in seven years. Erdoans Justice & Development party (AKP) won 41% of the vote, compared with 49% in 2011 elections. But the new Kurdish HD party managed to capture 12% of the vote, uniting Kurds with liberal left-wingers in Turkey. The result is a blow not only for Erdoans party, but also for his ambition to consolidate his own power and move the Turkish government to a more presidential system. Erdoan, who has ruled for 13 years, campaigned with a view to convert Turkish government into a presidential system, rather than a parliamentary system. Voters have resoundingly rejected this vision.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP)  Seven avid hikers in safety helmets, wetsuits and climbing harnesses smiled for a group photo before heading into the mouth of a narrow canyon in Zion National Park in Utah. The 50-something men and women from California and Nevada posed with their arms around each other before trying to climb and swim through the popular sandstone gorge. Days later, rescuers searching for their bodies found a camera revealing the final group photo. Hours after they entered Keyhole Canyon, dark skies unleashed fierce rains that sent water surging through the chasm, sweeping the seven people to their deaths Monday. The last body was found Thursday  the same day authorities recovered a 33-year-old man killed by flash flooding near the Utah-Arizona border, raising the death toll to 20 from the violent rainstorm. At least 12 other people, including nine children, died in a nearby polygamous town when two cars were swept away. A 6-year-old boy was still missing. Some of the seven hikers took a canyoneering skills course just before the excursion, park officials said. Some also knew each other through a hiking club in Valencia, California. The photo was taken on a \"tragic last adventure\" for the group who regularly hiked and backpacked, the children of victims Linda and Steve Arthur, of Camarillo, California, said in a statement. Steve Arthur, 58, was a sergeant and 21-year veteran of the Ventura County Sheriffs Department, Capt. John Reilly said. Arthur was awarded the Medal of Valor in 1998 for rescuing a man from a burning car. \"If he wasnt at work, he was out with his kids or grandkids, hiking all the time,\" Reilly said. Arthur was excited about the trip and boasted about getting the permits for Keyhole Canyon, which only 80 people a day are allowed to visit. \"He was fortunate he was with the love of his life  his wife  they were both excited about going on these trips,\" Commander Monica McGrath said. Mark MacKenzie, 56, of Valencia also looked out for others, particularly in the outdoors, said his mother Deanna MacKenzie Sisung. \"Hed carry a watermelon in his backpack, and hed usually be the first one up there, and hed serve everybody,\" Sisung said of MacKenzie, who had three children. Don Teichner, 55, of Mesquite, Nevada, met members of the group through a California hiking club. The father and grandfather was an executive at his familys Los Angeles-based garment-dyeing company, said cousin Jeff Teichner. Gary Favela, 51, of Rancho Cucamonga, California, was adventurous and had a love for canyoneering, his family said in a statement. Muku Reynolds, 59, of Chino, California, was a doting grandmother and active in many Meetup.com hiking groups, spending nearly every weekend outdoors, said Graham Willis, 32, who met her in one such group and summited Mount Whitney with her last summer. He said Reynolds, who grew up in Japan, was known for collecting heart-shaped rocks along trails. Reynolds had been canyoneering in Zion three years ago with a guide, said Kathryn Burrows, 54, who hikes with her and took a canyoneering course with her back then. The pair went on a five-day group backpacking trip in Kings Canyon National Park just last month and talked about celebrating Reynolds 60th birthday by hiking Machu Picchu in Peru. \"She knew those guys, she has hiked with that club a lot,\" Reynolds said. \"People really trust each other.\", Robin Brum, 53, a wife and mother from Camarillo, was a selfless person who cared for those around her, her family said. \"She leaves a hole in our hearts and our lives that will never be filled,\" a statement said. Park officials say they warned the group when they got their permit that there was a 40 percent chance of rain and flash flooding. Rangers give similar warnings nearly every day during the rainy season. Park policy prevents rangers from assessing visitors skills or stopping them from entering canyons. Zion is investigating what led to the deaths and reviewing its policies, but the process for canyon entry permits is decided at the national level, park spokesman David Eaker said. Rangers closed the canyons after the storm hit, but there was no way to warn those already inside the majestic slot formations that can quickly fill with rain water and leave people with no escape. The children of Steve and Linda Arthur said their parents were extremely cautious and had been watching weather reports closely. They texted family for updates before they headed into the canyon, but they didnt get cellphone service at the trailhead. \"This is nothing but a freak accident and a true case of being at the wrong place at the wrong time,\" the couples children said.

{"Content": "[Caption, Close, A family of four, including children between ages 4 and 7, were killed after a three-vehicle accident Sunday along Texas 105 in Conroe. A 68-year-old man faces intoxication manslaughter charges after a grisly crash killed a family of four Sunday afternoon near Lake Conroe  adding to the troubling tally of deadly driving deaths in Montgomery County. Ronald Cooper, of Montgomery, faces four counts of intoxication manslaughter and two counts of intoxication assault for his role in a three-vehicle wreck at 12:46 p.m. along Texas 105 near Marina Drive, right in front of Conroe Fire Station No. 6. The victims were identified late Sunday as: Roland Sedlmeier, 49; Melinda Sedlmeier, 42; Harley Sedlmeier, 6; and Sofie Sedlmeier, 4, who were riding together in a Toyota Echo left unrecognizable by the force of the crash. Two teenagers  16- and 15-year-old boys  in a Jeep Wrangler were injured, as was Cooper, who was arrested after the accident at a local hospital, police said. \"It was just a horrific tragedy,\" Montgomery County Precinct 1 Justice of the Peace Wayne Mack said. \"Just a terrible, horrific tragedy.\", The incident marks the first intoxication manslaughter charges filed since before Memorial Day in Montgomery County, where law enforcement have stepped up efforts to combat drunken-driving deaths. Sarah Jones, a resident of the neighborhood across the highway from Sundays crash site, said she often hears about crashes along this stretch of Texas 105, which has several bars along it. \"This is all too frequent in this area,\" Jones said. \"People come to visit the lake and hit the bars and then drive. Its just irresponsibility. ... I dont bring my kids out after dark. ... Now, with this happening during the day ... its never safe to go out.\", A relative of Coopers told KHOU Sunday that he hadnt been drinking alcohol, but was taking a new prescription medicine to treat a blood clot recently found in his brain. Montgomery County was the site of several serious head-on, drunken-driving wrecks, including two crashes that killed five people on Interstate 45 in a 48-hour stretch in the summer of 2012. In the first, a 24-year-old Spring woman attempted to drive home from a bar where she allegedly had drunk four beers and 17 shots. In the second incident, a National Guard recruiter killed three after he drove after allegedly drinking 22 beers. The accidents were among those that made Montgomery County the 10th-highest area in the state for alcohol-related driving deaths. Those numbers have declined from at least a dozen such cases a few years ago to four in 2014, partly because of an intense crackdown this summer. For the 100 days between Memorial Day and Labor Day, statistically the period with the highest likelihood of drunken driving crashes, stepped-up patrols and tightened blood-alcohol testing led to 643 arrests. Also during that period, not a single charge of intoxication manslaughter was filed, authorities said. According to public records, Cooper also was arrested in 2008 on DWI charges. Police didnt provide an account of where Cooper was headed at the time of Sundays wreck. He was driving a 2011 Hyundai Axera westbound when he hit the back of the familys 2011 Toyota, causing it to spin into the eastbound lanes. The teens in the Jeep tried to avoind the crash, but struck the Toyotas right side. Both the Jeep and Toyota landed on their sides. Everyone in Sedlmeiers vehicle was wearing proper safety restraints, Conroe Police Sgt. Dorcy Riddle said. Roland Sedlmeier was a captain at TransCanada, according to his Linkedin profile.The crash, which remains under investigation, closed all eastbound lanes and all but one westbound lane of Texas 105 at Lake Conroe for several hours.

Greeks were voting Sunday in their third national polls this year, called on to choose who they trust to steer the country into its new international bailout. ATHENS, Greece (AP)  Greeks were voting Sunday in their third national polls this year, called on to choose who they trust to steer the country into its new international bailout. Former Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras left-wing Syriza party, which made pledges to implement austerity measures in return for billions of euros in rescue loans, was marginally ahead of the rival center-right New Democracy in opinion polls leading up to the vote. But the polls, which showed many of the 9.9 million voters were undecided until two days before the vote or might abstain altogether, indicated the winner would not have enough votes to form a government alone. Tsipras, 41, triggered the election by resigning barely seven months into his four-year term, after facing a rebellion within Syriza over his policy U-turn in accepting the spending cuts and tax hikes stipulated by the bailout. Tsipras had won January elections on pledges of abolishing such measures, tied to Greeces first two bailouts. He has argued he had no choice but to accept the demands of European creditors for more tax hikes and spending cuts in return for Greeces third rescue, a three-year package worth 86 billion euros ($97 billion). He had vowed to repeal the measures imposed in return for the countrys first two bailouts  and despite winning a referendum he hastily called July 5 urging Greeks to reject creditor reform proposals. But without the third bailout, Greece  which has relied on international rescue loans since 2010  faced bankruptcy and a potentially disastrous exit from Europes joint currency. The campaign has been lackluster and somewhat muted  a far cry from the frenetic, high-stakes January campaign, which pitted the anti-bailout Tsipras against centrist parties that argued the deal with other Eurozone countries was the countrys best chance for an eventual return to some form of economic normalcy in a country ravaged by recession and with unemployment at around 25 percent. Now, the policies for whichever party wins have already been set in the form of the bailout agreement. The campaign of Tsipras main rival, New Democracys 61-year-old Vangelis Meimarakis, has centered on a return to stability. He painted Tsipras as a reckless, inexperienced politician who led the country toward a potential catastrophe and introduced strict banking restrictions in an effort to stem a bank run. Syrizas campaign has focused on doing away with the staid and often corrupt politics of the past. The government that emerges will have little time to waste. Creditors are expected to review progress of reforms as part of the bailout next month, while the government will also have to draft the 2016 state budget, overhaul the pension system, raise a series of taxes, including on farmers, carry out privatizations and merge social security funds. It must also oversee a critical bank recapitalization program, without which depositors with over 100,000 euros ($113,000) in their accounts will be forced to contribute. Polls have indicated no party is anywhere near the levels needed for an overall parliamentary majority of 151 seats in the 300-member legislature, even with the 50-seat bonus given to the winner, and a three-party coalition would likely be required. That should be achievable with help from two centrist pro-European small parties: the formerly mighty socialist PASOK, and relative newcomer To Potami, or The River. The Nazi-inspired extreme-right Golden Dawn party has been consistently polling in third place, but would not be approached by any of the other parties to form a coalition. A total of nine parties have a chance of reaching the 3 percent threshold needed to enter parliament. Polls close at 7 p.m. (1600 GMT) and final results are expected by early Monday.]", "Date": "20150920", "Title": "[Greeks vote once more in early elections]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/world/article/Greeks-vote-once-more-in-early-elections-6516990.php\n", "Author": "[Elena Becatoros, Associated Press]"}
{"Content": "[Caption, Close, , Ahmed Mohamed stands in handcuffs at Irving police department. Scary-looking, Regarding \"Obama: Cool clock, Ahmed\" (Page A1, Thursday), I was alarmed that the student who brought a \"clock\" to school is talking of racial bias. The fact is, he brought a contraption that was unidentifiable, in a box and wired. I believe it showed poor judgment. I was also alarmed that the school and police force are being criticized for taking preemptive measures to assure the safety of other students and school officials. I think we can all agree, that this device looked more like a bomb than a clock and in todays world, no one can be too careful. Mary Hill, Houston, , Knee-jerk, Regarding \"Obama: Cool clock, Ahmed\" (Page A1, Thursday), in an ironic twist, it seems racist to assume this had anything to do with race or religion. As sad as it is, school shootings, bomb threats and hoaxes are all too common these days. Because of this, no one is allowed to bring a weapon, or anything that even resembles one, on school property. It would have been racist if authorities had assumed that since he was Muslim, he had ties to ISIS. But, they accused him of making \"a movie bomb or hoax device.\" Thats an accusation that could be used toward any child in America whos been raised watching Hollywood movies and TV shows, and shows up with something suspicious at school. School authorities have a duty to abide by the \"better safe than sorry\" adage, because they are responsible for the safety of all the children at school. Ahmed was treated as we hope he would be treated: Just like any other child with a suspicious object. Hundreds of kids are sent home from school each year for having a weapon or something potentially threatening, playing a prank, creating a hoax, etc. This got turned into a firestorm of racism because of the unfortunate coincidence that, in this case, the child was Muslim.  , Susan Ellis Brittain, Houston, Overkill, I find it deplorable that Ahmed had to go through arrest, handcuffs, interrogation by intimidating officers, and a 3-day suspension -  all because of ignorance on the part of his school and the police. The police departments ignorance of bombs speaks poorly about the level of training they have received. At the very least, the bomb squad could have been summoned before Ahmed was punished wrongly. Lets demand that common sense be applied to such situations instead of a knee-jerk reaction against an intelligent student: we need such students, and I hope this experience wont squelch his creativity. Ross Bonny, Spring, , Proper action, The authorities did exactly what they should have done. This clock could just as well have been a mock run to see what would happen.

{"Content": "[Caption, Close, Pope Francis, Pilgrims hold up their hands to be blessed by Pope Francis during a Mass in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Latin Americas first pope is due to arrive in the United States on Tuesday. The first Latin American pope will soon arrive in \"gringolandia\" for a six-day apostolic visit - his first to the U.S. as pontiff. Pope Francis visit, which starts in Washington on Tuesday before proceeding to New York and Philadelphia, has officially been scheduled to coincide with the celebration of the World Meeting of Families. As has been widely reported, Francis will also address the UN General Assembly on climate change. For Hispanic Catholics, however, the most significant part of the visit may lie elsewhere, in the popes symbolically key visit to Our Lady Queen of Angels School in East Harlem, a Catholic school whose student population is 70 percent Latino and 22 percent black. Francis presence at the school represents a public show of papal concern for the more socially and economically vulnerable members of U.S. society, many of whom are young Catholic Hispanics. But it is also a wake-up call for the U.S. Church to involve itself more actively in the everyday realities of Hispanics lives because the future of the Catholic Church in the U.S. will itself be increasingly Hispanic. The school visit is even more significant in light of Francis recent protests (May encyclical letter Laudato Si) against the global economic inequalities that have led to what he called a \"tragic rise\" in the number of migrants fleeing poverty worldwide. On Wall Street, Francis will use his visit to place at center stage a disadvantaged, largely Hispanic school community of migrant origin. This approach marks a clear departure from the papacy of John Paul II, a more conservative pope for whom Hispanic and Latin American Catholics were key pieces in a global fight against communism. In contrast, Francis has chosen to highlight the marginalization and uprootedness that are experienced by many Hispanics largely as a result of the global economic model endorsed by the U.S. More than this, Francis believes that the continued exclusion of poorer Hispanics from fuller social and economic participation in the U.S. degrades America. In Washington, Francis will canonize the 18th century Franciscan missionary Junpero Serra, the \"Apostle of California,\" during a Mass in the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. Serra toiled among the indigenous Pame people in Mexico after arriving from Spain. He then spent 15 years in California, founding missions at San Diego, San Francisco and elsewhere before his death in 1784. What possible relevance does the canonization of an obscure migrant saint have in 2015? According to Francis, Serra should be seen as \"one of the founding fathers of the United States\" by virtue of his missionary zeal and protection of his indigenous and Hispanic flock. By following his legacy, Francis has said, \"may all Americans rediscover their own dignity and unite themselves ever more closely to Christ and his Church.\", The force of language is striking. Francis is saying that the denial of dignity to Hispanics is not merely wrong, but wrong because it compromises the dignity of all Americans. Since it is unlikely that Francis visit will lead to sudden conversions among world policy makers over climate change, it may be that its greatest impact is felt in his call for greater recognition of migrants humanity. Francis is clearly priming American Catholics to take a stronger position on questions such as migration reform and the social inclusion of Hispanics. As the U.S. Catholic Church becomes ever more Hispanic, while Hispanics themselves become more diverse in their religious choices, Francis is making a renewed pitch for the spiritual loyalties of migrant communities. And that might just be the most impactful message of this papal trip - a very public recognition by Francis of the individual identity of Hispanics, the problems that they face and their value to the Church. , Butler is an associate professor of modern Mexican history and is also affiliated with the Department of Religious Studies in the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Texas at Austin. ]", "Date": "20150919", "Title": "[Butler: Pope visit puts U.S. relationship with Latinos front and center]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Butler-Pope-visit-puts-U-S-relationship-with-6516196.php", "Author": "[By Matthew Butler]"}
