{"Content": "[Caption, Close  , WASHINGTON (AP)  The U.S. may not have \"risen from recession\" quite as rousingly as President Barack Obama suggested in his State of the Union speech Tuesday night. Seven years after that severe downturn began, household income hasnt recovered and healthy job growth is complicated by the poor quality, and pay, of many of those jobs. Its always problematic when a president takes credit for an improving economy, just as it is when hes blamed for things going bad. A leader can only do so much, for better or worse, and there are two sides to every economy. But after an election in which Obama largely held off on chest-beating, he claimed credit in bold terms for what is going right. Also in his speech, Obama skimmed over the cost to taxpayers of free community college tuition and invited closer scrutiny with his claims about U.S. support for Syrian moderates and about his record of public-lands preservation. Take a look at some of his claims, and the facts and the political climate behind them, in his speech above.]", "Date": "20150120", "Author": "[The Associated Press]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/Fact-checking-Obama-s-State-of-the-Union-6028743.php", "Title": "[Fact checking Obama's State of the Union]"}
