{"Content": "[AUSTIN  Local taxing entities would be required to approve property tax hikes by a 60-percent majority vote under a bill approved Thursday by the Texas Senate. \"This is a historic day,\" said Sen. Paul Bettencourt, R-Houston, who successfully attached an amendment mandating the change to another bill about property taxes. \"For the first time we have applied a super majority requirement to help protect Texas taxpayers from rising property taxes.\", Bettencourt was the Harris County tax assessor-collector from 1998 to 2008. Under Bettencourts amendment, approved 22-9, a taxing unit such as a city council, a county commissioners court, a school district of a special district would have to have a 60-percent majority vote to exceed the\" effective tax rate.\" Current law requires only a majority vote, Bettencourt said. Bettencourt said the change would enact a truth-in-taxation policy, despite contentions from critics that the amendment would interfere with the business of local taxing entities. \"This looks like Big Brother knows better than Little Brother,\" said Sen. Royce West, D-Dallas. Senate Bill 1760, which Bettencourt amended, also would remove the requirement that taxpayers due a refund have to apply for it, requires taxing entities to justify the need for a tax hike on notices and election ballot, and requires the state comptrollers office to annually publish a list of tax rates statewide, so the public can see who has the highest tax rates. ]", "Date": "20150430", "Author": "[Mike Ward]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/texas/article/Bill-would-require-super-majority-to-pass-local-6234713.php", "Title": "[Bill would require super majority to pass local tax hikes]"}
