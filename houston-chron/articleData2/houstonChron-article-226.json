{"Content": "[The mayoral scramble to win over conservative Houstonians has moved to television. City Councilman Stephen Costello released the first TV ad of his mayoral campaign Monday, joining former mayor of Kemah and fellow fiscal conservative Bill King on cable networks. The $28,233 ad to run on Comcast networks for three weeks plays on Costellos love of running and features him jogging through Houston, promising fixes to the citys roads and congestion. \"Roads in Houston are terrible, and traffic is worse. As an engineer, I have a plan to fix both,\" Costello says in the 30-second introductory ad. \"Houstons best days are still ahead, and Im running to lead the way,\" Costello says before promising to fight wasteful spending through tax cuts and debt reduction, as well as increase the Houston Police Departments patrol officers by 1,500. Meanwhile, Houstonians on Costellos jogging route shout \"Hello, Costello\" as he passes. According to Comcast, the ad is slated to run in the Memorial, Cinco Ranch, Westchase, North Houston and Inner Loop zones. Most of these coverage areas are reliably Republican, as were those in which Kings first ad aired in May. However, the Inner Loop is traditionally home to more progressive voters. Costellos ad buy is about a third of the size of Kings initial purchase a first step, according to his campaign. \"We expect to have a substantial presence on television through the rest of the campaign,\" said Costello campaign manager Ward Curtin, who noted that the ad is running digitally, with paid promotions on Twitter and Facebook.]", "Date": "20150714", "Author": "[Rebecca Elliott]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/news/politics/houston/article/Costello-releases-first-TV-ad-joining-King-6384094.php", "Title": "[Costello releases first TV ad]"}
