Martin OMalley (D-Maryland). According to the poll, 67% of voters would support Clinton over those other Democrats. Warren was in second place with 10%, however, the poll showed her support rising from 7% in surveys conducted in November and September of last year. Warren seemed to gain at the expense of Biden who was in third place at 8% and down from 12% and 10% in the prior polls. On the Republican side, the poll found Gov. Chris Christie (R-New Jersey) on top of the field with 13%. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee were tied for second with 12% each. Christie seems to be rebounding after the \"Bridgegate\" scandal. Prior polls conducted in May and March of this year showed him under 10%.
