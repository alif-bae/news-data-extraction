{"Content": "[Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) came out swinging after President Barack Obama wholeheartedly endorsed new internet regulations Monday morning. Cruz, who is mulling a run for president in 2016, compared the entire concept of \"net neutrality\"  which posits that internet companies should not be allowed to speed or slow down their services for certain users  to Obamas much-maligned healthcare reform. \"Net Neutrality is Obamacare for the Internet; the Internet should not operate at the speed of government,\" Cruz wrote on Twitter. Cruzs spokeswoman, Amanda Carpenter, added that net neutrality would place the government \"in charge of determining pricing, terms of service, and what products can be delivered. Sound like Obamacare much?\", The Federal Communications Commission is forming rules to regulate whether internet service providers can charge certain websites for faster speeds, or, conversely, block or limit those who dont pay. According to a Wall Street Journal report last Friday, the rules are so complicated that the FCC most likely wont finish them until the end of the year. On Monday, Obama called for the internet to be reclassified as a utility service. \"Ever since the internet was created, its been organized around basic principles of openness, fairness, and freedom,\" Obama said in a video posted by the White House. \"This set of principles  the idea of net neutrality  has unleashed the power of the internet and given innovators a chance to thrive. Abandoning these principles would threaten to end the internet as we know it.\", Join the conversation about this story , See Also:]", "Date": "20141110", "Author": "[Colin Campbell, provided by]", "Link": "http://www.chron.com/default/article/Ted-Cruz-Says-Net-Neutrality-Is-Obamacare-For-5883359.php", "Title": "[Ted Cruz Says Net Neutrality Is 'Obamacare For The Internet']"}
