{"Content": "[[, 2016 looks remarkably like 1992: an election with a Bush, a Clinton and an uncontrollable billionaire. The last time around the unscripted business mogul changed the nature of the campaign; this time he could cost the Republican Party the presidency., Ross Perot entered the race in February 1992, taking on two unpopular opponents: Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush. After leading through the entire month of June, he dropped out, dropped back in, and ultimately received the highest third-party vote share since 1912: a stunning 18.9%., Perots traction with the electorate led Clinton and Bush to address issues  including the federal budget deficit  they might not have otherwise. His success also led then-Rep. Newt Gingrich to propose his Contract With America, a policy platform that ignored social issues in favor of political reform, including the sweeping changes to congressional process that have played a large part in the current gridlock., But, contrary to popular belief, Perot was not responsible for Clintons victory. On election day, Perot supporters split right down the middle in their second choice. This fact shouldnt really surprise anyone, because Perots appeal was nonpartisan. He promised to fix the mess both major parties had gotten the country into: unbalanced budgets, lost manufacturing jobs, a political process reserved for wealthy lobbyists. Sound familiar? Sound, specifically, like Donald Trump?, Trump, like Perot, is an equal-opportunity critic. But if he decides to run as an independent  a possibility he refused to rule out at the first Republican debate  he probably wont have a Perot-like balanced effect on the contest., A recent Washington Post/ABC poll shows that in a three-way race, Trump increases Hillary Rodham Clintons edge over Jeb Bush to 16 percentage points from 6 percentage points in a two-way race., And according to a recent Rasmussen poll, 1 in 5 Republicans say they are \"very likely\" to vote for a Trump-led third-party effort, while less than 10% of Democrats say the same., There is good reason, beyond polling data, to expect a Trump independent candidacy to hurt Republicans more than Democrats: his agenda. Trumps signature issue is immigration. He, of course, favors a hard-line approach, insisting without evidence that the Mexican government is sending criminals across the border. Unlike Perots emphasis on trade and the deficit, which drew support from both Republicans and Democrats, Trumps talking points exploit a deep division specific to the Republican Party., A recent Pew survey found that a third of Republicans, and half of the most active Republicans, do not support any path to citizenship. A comprehensive immigration reform bill (which has passed in the Senate and which Speaker John Boehner says is a top priority for the House) would further alienate anti-immigration Republicans from their party and further reinforce Trumps appeal to the conservative base., With eight to 10 states up for grabs, and the Republican candidate quite possibly tethered to a comprehensive immigration reform bill  either Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio would have trouble shedding a pro-immigration reform reputation  a Trump independent candidacy could do real damage to the GOP. If Trump attracted even 5% of the vote, he could decide the election in Clintons favor. No wonder Republicans are worried., Ronald B. Rapoport and Walter J.

{"Content": "[[, \"Kevin, Kevin, come see us!\" yelled a man pushing a stroller., \"Yo, K.J., stop by the community garden!\" urged a friend from the old neighborhood., Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson beamed as he walked through the heart of Oak Park, a long-struggling community now in the middle of a renaissance, thanks in large part to him., Once home to gangsters, addicts and the local Black Panthers, it now has new condos, cafes, a bookstore and an art gallery. A brew pub is being built; a historic theater has been restored., \"This work is what makes me proudest,\" said Johnson, 48, scanning the neighborhood to point at the highlights., It was in Oak Park that Johnson had his first taste of celebrity, leading the state in scoring for Sacramento High Schools basketball team. His star grew brighter when he played basketball at UC Berkeley and then in the NBA., Today hes back home, where he is the citys first African American mayor. His popularity has soared  even his critics acknowledge that  since the biggest political coup of his career: his successful effort last year to keep the Sacramento Kings basketball team from leaving town., This year, he pushed through approval for a new basketball arena. He also took over as head of the U.S. Conference of Mayors and became a spokesman for the NBA players union as the league drew up its response to Clippers owner Donald Sterlings racially charged comments., \"I hope that every bigot in this country sees what happened to Mr. Sterling and recognizes that if he can fall, so can you!\" said Johnson as his image was beamed across the nation from the steps of Los Angeles City Hall shortly after the NBA banned Sterling for life., That triumphant moment also elevated his political standing across California, where he is among a number of younger-generation Democrats widely discussed as prospective candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate., A jump to higher office would not be easy, though., For all his newfound political celebrity, Johnson is not the typical Democrat who wins statewide elections. Hes a corporate-friendly, pro-business centrist who has fought teachers unions and tax increases. There would also be the past to beat back: the taint of old scandal and allegations of sexual impropriety., But he has defied expectations before., ::, Born to a 16-year-old schoolgirl, Johnson was 3 when his father drowned in the Sacramento River. Since his mother wasnt ready for the responsibility, he ended up being raised by his maternal grandparents, George and Georgia Peat, who were among the few whites in a predominantly African American neighborhood., His grandparents taught him to be opened-minded when it comes to race, Johnson said. And nobody had more to do with the man he would become than his grandfather, a sheet-metal worker who rose each workday at 4:30 a.m. and always had a soft spot for the underdog., \"You know in the Bible, the good Samaritan? My grandfather was a modern-day version of that,\" Johnson said. \"I want to follow those footsteps.\", After graduating from high school in 1983, he headed to Cal. He found instant success on the basketball court but had trouble keeping up in the classroom., He channeled his grandfathers work ethic, becoming a regular at the library as well as the gym. One of the biggest sports stars in school history, he steered away from the campus social scene, surrounding himself instead with studious friends who werent athletes., He is a devout Christian, and his two closest confidants in college were a prayerful Somali Muslim and a roommate who was an observant Jew. Theyd often stay up late, their study sessions turning into long talks about faith and solving the worlds problems., The 6-foot-1 Johnson was the seventh pick in the 1987 NBA draft. He would become an All-Star whose determined aggression led to a famous dunk over Hakeem Olajuwon and an ejection from a game after a shoving match with Magic Johnson. Off the court he was a do-gooder, so controlled that he didnt drink, smoke or curse, so eager to give back that President George H.W. Bush honored him as one of the nations \"thousand points of light.\", After retiring from the NBA in 2000, he had a range of options: broadcasting, coaching, even running for office in Arizona, where both Democrats and Republicans wooed him., Instead he returned to Sacramento and focused on building up Oak Park., \"It just grabbed me, this idea that something had to be done to help my community,\" Johnson said, standing outside the single-story, three-bedroom home where he was raised. A pit bull barked nearby. A homeless couple guided a shopping cart down the street., \"My history is here.\", ::, Sacramentos mayor has rarely touched a basketball since leaving the NBA. The last time he did, three years ago on his 45th birthday, he quit after clanking a ball off a rim while trying to prove he could still dunk., The old spring in his legs may be gone, but he still retains a bit of the liquid strut common to professional athletes, a walk on full display as he toured Oak Park, excitedly describing life after returning home., He expanded St. HOPE Academy, the after-school program he started during his playing career with 12 kids  because Jesus had 12 disciples., Then, under his direction, St. HOPEs real estate development arm became the first in years to bet big on Oak Park, one of the citys poorest neighborhoods., Dressed in a sharp brown suit on a 90-degree day, Johnson walked past a dog collar boutique. A woman inside came out to chat. A disabled man in a wheelchair asked for help; not surprisingly, he was a familiar face to the mayor, who slipped a $20 bill into the mans hand., Down the street was his old high school. Johnson led a bruising fight in 2003 to push out the unionized teaching staff at \"Sac High\" because he was convinced that poor-quality public education was holding back waves of kids., St. HOPE took over. Now called Sacramento Charter High School, it has about half the number of students and dramatically higher test scores, arguably making it one of the best inner-city campuses in California., After his success in Oak Park, Johnson decided to make a bid for City Hall. Energized by Barack Obamas candidacy for president, he ran for mayor in 2008., The race was as heated and sensational as Sacramento has ever had. Unionized teachers, still smarting from the charter school battle, were harsh critics. The other candidates blasted Johnson for his political inexperience and worse., They chastised him for a string of code violations issued to properties he owned in Oak Park. They called voters attention to a federal inspector generals report that said St. HOPE had misused $847,700 in grant money meant for an inner-city program. The nonprofit was forced to return roughly half., Early in the campaign, the Sacramento Bee detailed a draft agreement that had Johnson paying a $230,000 settlement to a 16-year-old Phoenix girl he had mentored in the mid-1990s. Shed told police he fondled her. Hed denied it., The inspector general report had cited other allegations of sexual misconduct. One case alleged that Johnson had inappropriately touched a senior at the high school. Though the girl later denied the story, the federal report detailed similar allegations about advances toward two young women involved in the inner-city program., Investigations were conducted in Sacramento and Phoenix. No charges were filed., Johnson survived the onslaught, handily beating incumbent Heather Fargo in a runoff., He recently called the allegations \"old news with no merit.\", \"Politics is a dirty business, I understand that,\" he said. \"Its all I have to say.\", ::, Johnsons first four-year term was rocky., Sacramento, population 470,000, retains a small-town sensibility. In a framework set up during Prohibition, the city manager has more control than the mayor, whose vote counts the same as a City Council member., Johnson believed the election had been a mandate for him to remake Sacramento, and he angered many who were resistant to change., Critics were particularly put off when he proposed a referendum that would have given the mayor more executive power. A judge blocked it from the ballot. The new mayor was labeled imperious and power-hungry, and he was derisively called \"Boss Johnson.\", Looking back now, Johnson seemed chastened. \"I was just full of energy and wanted to just get things done. I was going 100 miles an hour,\" he said. \"I had to learn that in politics, it does not work like it does in sports.\", In 2011, after a bicoastal romance, he married Michelle Rhee, the former chancellor of public schools in Washington, D.C., and one of the more polarizing figures in the national debate over education reform. Rhee had made a name for herself with her efforts to limit union influence and her embrace of student test scores to measure teacher performance., As the mayor ran for another term in 2012, his marriage only reinforced the teachers unions opposition., Still, he won easily and his fortunes began to shift., The economy began to rebound and crime was falling. Luminaries including LeBron James, U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and chef Alice Waters came to Sacramento at Johnsons behest, partly to back his school reform and economic development work, and partly because Johnson is intent on bringing celebrity glitz to his hometown., He solidified support from the citys business elite with his stance against raising taxes and his willingness to make it easier for businesses like Wal-Mart to open mega-stores., \"We love the guy,\" said Roger Niello, a former Republican assemblyman and president of Sacramentos Metro Chamber of Commerce. \"He appeals to a broad range here. Frankly, with his views on business, hes a Democrat people on the right can get behind.\", Johnsons biggest success involved the Sacramento Kings, whose owners stunned the city last year by announcing they had sold the team to a group including the Clippers new owner, Microsoft billionaire Steve Ballmer, who planned to move the franchise to Seattle. The ownership transfer seemed like a done deal., But Johnson dug in. He put together a group of potential buyers led by Silicon Valley software magnate Vivek Ranadive., Sacramento developer Mark Friedman, part of Ranadives group, flew to Dallas with Johnson, who was going to make a final pitch to the NBA. Friedman was awed by Johnsons command of the issue, by his charisma and how he held sway when he stood before the leagues owners, emphasizing his citys deep connection with the team., \"Star power,\" Friedman recalled. \"Sacramento has it for the first time with him.\", Johnsons pitch beat Ballmers; the Kings stayed., In May, between cross-country trips for the mayors conference and the Sterling scandal, Johnson presided over a tense public meeting at City Hall. The council was considering a proposal he hailed as key to boosting the local economy: spending $255 million in public money  more than half the total cost  to build a basketball arena., When the deal was approved, the reception from the crowd was like a moment from the former point guards playing days. A standing-room-only audience rose to chant: \"Kevin Johnson, Kevin Johnson!\" The mayor leaped to his feet, clenched his fists and began doling out high-fives., ::, Its hard to say whether the past, particularly the sexual allegations, will haunt Johnson should he seek higher office., \"When a politician survives an attack like we put on him, it goes a long way to putting to rest the problem,\" said Mike Madrid, a conservative consultant who worked in 2008 on a series of aggressive anti-Johnson campaign ads. \"We threw everything at the guy we had, but he won.\", If the mayors reputation among Sacramento Democrats is any indication, he cant count on widespread support from progressives in a statewide election. Organized labor has extended its support warily. Johnson remains vilified by the city and statewide teachers unions., The Democratic Party of Sacramento County has never endorsed him, grumbling that he spends too much time hobnobbing out of town, that hes too close to corporations and that he gambled the citys fiscal health by spending millions on the basketball arena., In November, Sacramento voters will have a chance to consider the latest Johnson-backed proposal to give Sacramento mayors more power. Many observers believe that if the initiative wins, hell aim for a third and final term in 2016. He hasnt said so yet., Asked if he has designs on running for Congress, perhaps as a successor to Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein or Barbara Boxer, he answered firmly: \"Not interested.\", \"Not my personality,\" he said. \"Theyre legislators, and I would rather be an executive. Ive been fighting for six years to change governance in Sacramento so you can finally be an executive. I want the buck to stop somewhere and be held accountable.\", So what about governor?, Here, his eyes lighted up. Johnson said that when he thinks of holding the states highest office, he thinks first of changing the education system. The prospect excited him. \"But for now,\" he said, smiling broadly, \"Im happy where I am.\", kurt.streeter@latimes.comTwitter: @kurtstreeter]", "Date": "20141004", "Title": "[Ex-basketball star Kevin Johnson is back holding court in his hometown]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-mayor-kevin-johnson-20141005-story.html", "Author": "[Kurt Streeter]"}
{"Content": "[[, \"The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice,\" the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. assured his followers. But was he right?, The arc of American history, at least, has a different shape. During the 19th century, a high point for justice was reached after the Civil War, with Reconstruction Republicans guaranteeing equal protection and voting rights for blacks in the 14th and 15th amendments. But these brave words did not prevent a tragic retreat, from the Gilded Age beginning in the 1880s through the Roaring 20s. By 1929, blacks were barred from the polls, locked in third-rate schools, excluded from white neighborhoods and consigned to menial jobs. All the while, the Supreme Court blessed these retreats in the name of the Constitution., This tragic history haunts us today as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Second Reconstruction: the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act, of the 1960s. The Second Reconstruction was a far more impressive achievement than its predecessor. After Lincolns assassination, President Andrew Johnson, of Tennessee, did everything in his power to defeat the 14th Amendment. A century later, another presidential assassination opened the way for Lyndon Johnson to lead the nation in a very different direction., LBJ pushed the Civil Rights Act through Congress and defended this achievement in his election campaign in 1964 against Sen. Barry Goldwater. Citing Goldwaters opposition to the act, Johnson appealed to his fellow Southerners in Memphis, Tenn., shortly before the election: \"As a man that has spent all of his life and cast his every vote in Texas, and as the grandson of two Confederate veterans, I think one of the things that we are going to have to do is wipe away the Mason-Dixon Line across our politics.The mandate of this election is going to be a mandate to unite this nation.\", This \"mandate\" is often overlooked in telling the story of Johnsons masterful leadership in pushing the Voting Rights Act of 1965 through Congress. While his constant arm-twisting was important, his landslide victory over Goldwater, including in much of the South, demonstrated that Americans overwhelmingly supported his demand for an end to all forms of voting discrimination. It also opened space for Republicans such as Illinois Sen. Everett Dirksen to build bipartisan support for the presidents initiatives., Goldwaters crushing defeat also allowed Richard Nixon to reenter the presidential sweepstakes as one of those supporters. With the Fair Housing Act stalled in the House in the spring of 1968, Nixon intervened to break the logjam and helped secure its passage. He followed up by conducting a fall campaign that \"conspicuously, conscientiously, calculatedly, denied himself all racist votes, yielding them to [George] Wallace\"  as Theodore H. White explained in his classic book \"The Making of the President 1968.\", The Second Reconstruction, unlike the first, was a bipartisan collaboration, with political leaders joining with the civil rights movement in large acts of statesmanship that gained the consent of the American people in a series of sweeping electoral victories., Despite the remarkable character of this achievement, the arc of justice is now once again in sharp decline, during Americas Second Gilded Age., The Supreme Court is playing a leading role in this act of betrayal. Just as the 19th century court struck down the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which would have banned discrimination in public accommodations and transportation, the Roberts court has struck down key provisions of the modern Voting Rights Act. What is more, it keeps chipping away at other basic principles established during the civil rights era, as in last weeks decision on affirmative action in university admissions. If these dynamics continue, the annual celebration of Martin Luther King Day will turn into a tragic recital of his lost legacy., The way to stop this runaway court is through presidential leadership of the kind we saw half a century ago. In 2016, as in 1964, each party will offer very different visions of our constitutional future: the Republicans defending the Roberts court, the Democrats attacking it. If a Democrat triumphs, he or she will be in a position to fill Supreme Court vacancies with new justices who could call a halt to the further destruction of the civil rights legacy. As in Goldwaters case, a Republican defeat might well open a space for a new generation of leaders determined to reclaim the partys Lincolnian legacy., But its easy to tell another story, one in which Republican victories in 2016 and 2020 serve to accelerate the Roberts courts assault on the Second Reconstruction., Only one thing is clear: As Americans celebrate the civil rights achievements of the day-before-yesterday, their actions in the not-too-distant future will shape the arc of constitutional justice for a very long time to come., Bruce Ackerman teaches law and political science at Yale.

She makes that amount per speech., ------------, Sanders caved to the protesters from the Black Lives Matter movement and gave activist Marissa Johnson the microphone. \"I was going to tell Bernie how racist this city is, even with all of these progressives, but youve already done that for me. Thank you,\" she said, apparently in response to members of the crowd who booed her. I suppose if youve already conceded that you arent reasonable, its not hard to argue that booing an uninvited rabble-rouser is \"racist.\", Its understandable that all eyes have been on the insane food fight Donald Trump has instigated on the right. Even Trumps biggest detractors  and I count myself among their number  have to concede that Trump is awfully entertaining. But while the spectacle on the right seems like a canceled TV reality show pilot  call it \"Desperate Billionaires of Manhattan\"  the spectacle on the left is no less fascinating or significant., Sanders, the lifelong independent socialist running for the Democratic nomination, has been gathering historic crowds, much larger than anything Hillary Rodham Clinton or Trump have been able to manage. Saturdays rally drew 15,000 people. The following night in Portland, Ore., 28,000 reportedly attended. The best Clinton has done  in her adopted home state of New York, at her kickoff event no less  was 5,500., The Clinton team is clearly nervous. Her poll numbers have been plummeting as Sanders have been surging. The campaign moved up its ad buys from November to this month. Shes been tacking ever further left., The trouble for Clinton and the Democrats generally is that while Barack Obama was able to unite the factions of the left to get himself elected, its not clear anyone else can., Obama wanted to be a Reagan of the left, a \"transformative\" president who moved the magnetic poles of American politics leftward. The jury is out on that project, but he did succeed in at least one sense. Reagan united foreign policy hawks, social conservatives and economic conservatives  the famous three legs to the stool of the conservative movement., Obama did something very similar on the left. He united the civil rights or identity politics wing, the economic or egalitarian wing and the more elitist technocratic wing. Obviously, these movements overlap  just as the different factions of the Reagan coalition overlapped  but each has its own priorities and passions., Aided by his experience as a former community organizer and his historic status as the first black president, Obama held the coalition together through force of personality., The Democratic Party has always had internal conflicts. Franklin D. Roosevelts coalition contained socialist Jews and blacks and Southern segregationists. That coalition held for 20 years after his presidency. But the Obama coalition seems to be fraying while hes still in office, and none of his presumptive heirs have the charisma or skills to repair or sustain the coalition., Sanders has charm, but the Jewish socialist transplant from Brooklyn has spent his political life in a state that has only 7,500 blacks. He lacks the vocabulary to appeal beyond the white left. Meanwhile, the black left, an indispensable voting bloc, has no standard-bearer in the primaries and is clearly angry about it., Clintons most comfortable in the role of elitist technocrat, which is great for fundraising from Wall Street and wooing Beltway journalists, but its not so useful for wooing voters in a populist environment. Thanks to her husband, she still has goodwill among African Americans. But she lacks the charisma, passion or personal story to excite either the black left or the white left. The woman who left the White House \"dead broke\" makes five times the average Americans annual income per speech., The GOPs Trump problem will eventually melt away.

Barbara Boxer., \"Regardless of Antonios decision, there are still viable Latino and Latina candidates who would continue to excite voters, make it a contested race and bring out Latino voters in the 2016 election, said Assemblyman Luis Alejo (D-Watsonville), the caucus chairman. \"There are other viable Latino and Latina candidates that we will converse with.\", Currently, state Atty.

{"Content": "[[, A group urging Hillary Rodham Clinton to run for president in 2016 held a fundraiser in downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday night, during which supporters called it their duty to encourage the former secretary of State to seek the White House., Our job is to basically convince, to urge, to nudge, to hug Hillary Clinton into the presidential race, said Michael Trujillo, a senior advisor to the Ready for Hillary Super PAC. So as we take this journey literally three years from now, on election day hopefully its all of us at the White House, hopefully its all of us saying thank you to Hillary., The fundraiser at the art deco Exchange LA nightclub raised thousands of dollars for the super PAC, Trujillo said, making it the groups biggest fundraiser to date. Volunteers handed out yard signs, T-shirts and bumper stickers to the more than 400 people who were asked to donate at least $20.16 to attend., Hosted by many young Democratic operatives who worked for former Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former city Controller Wendy Greuel, the event focused on the prospect of Clinton being elected the nations first female president., PHOTOS: 2013s memorable political moments, Organizers played a video of Clinton conceding the 2008 Democratic nomination to then-Sen. Barack Obama, a speech at the National Building Museum that was as much about her desire to see a woman elected president as it was to unite Democrats after a bitterly divisive primary., As we gather here today in this historic, magnificent building, the 50th woman to leave this Earth is orbiting overhead. If we can blast 50 women into space, we will someday launch a woman into the White House, Clinton said in the video., Among the speakers Wednesday night were Councilwoman Nury Martinez, the lone elected woman at City Hall, and Greuel, who unsuccessfully sought to be the citys first female mayor., Were the second-largest city in the country, were down to one woman at City Hall. That is not good. That is not good for my daughter, who can call her mother a city councilwoman, Martinez said. I need my daughter to call her president a woman., We have a lot of work to do. Three years from today we can elect the first woman president of the United States, she continued. Hillary needs to know that we are ready in Los Angeles, we are ready in California, that were going to be mobilized and make sure little girls, our mothers, our sisters, our daughters, our friends and our men in this country are ready for a woman president., And in an only-in-Los Angeles twist, the surprise guest who concluded the event was Omarosa, who worked as a scheduler in President Bill Clintons administration before becoming a reality show villain on The Apprentice., All of us have to stick together and get behind this sister because Im going to tell you, when I was at the White House, she cared about each and every one of us and she made sure we stayed connected to the issues that were important, Omarosa said., The event took place two days before Hillary Clinton is due to return to California for a series of speeches and awards., PHOTOS: The battle over Obamacare, California has long played a key role in the political success of Clinton and her husband. The states deep-pocketed donors provided millions of dollars in support for Bill Clintons two presidential campaigns, and it was the state that clinched the Democratic nomination for him in 1992. In 2008, Hillary Clintons eight-point win in California helped keep her in the fight after a string of losses to Obama. The state and its donors will likely be crucial if she decides to run again., In October, Clinton gave her strongest indication to date that she is considering another White House bid., \"I am not going to begin to think seriously about it until sometime next year,\" Clinton said during a speech to the Long Island Assn. in New York, according to Newsday. \"I will think about it because its something on a lot of peoples minds. And its on my mind as well.\", Since then Clinton has come under pressure to run from leading Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Tuesday and Sen. Charles E. Schumer on Saturday., After Schumer exhorted her to run during a speech at the Iowa Democratic Partys Jefferson-Jackson fundraiser, her office said Clinton has not made a decision., \"Senator Schumer is an old colleague and an even older friend, and what he said about her is very flattering. Ultimately though, this is a very personal decision that she hasnt made,\" Clintons office said in a statement to Reuters., Still, the question will be raised every time she makes a speech. On Friday, Clinton is to accept an award for her work on behalf of women and children from the International Medical Corps in Beverly Hills. The following day, shes to be honored at a brunch at USC by the Mexican American Leadership Initiative, before heading to the Bay Area for additional events., seema.mehta@latimes.com, Twitter: @latseema]", "Date": "20131107", "Title": "[Hillary Clinton supporters meet in Los Angeles to boost 2016 bid]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-hillary-clinton-los-angeles-fundraiser-20131106-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}

Bernie Sanders on Monday, the first union support hes received in his long-shot quest to capture the Democratic presidential nomination over Hillary Rodham Clinton., National Nurses United praised Sanders for his uncompromised activism in its endorsement at an Oakland gathering, ahead of his trip to Los Angeles where hes set to hold a nighttime rally at Memorial Sports Arena., We believe the next president should represent the people from all steps in life, RoseAnn DeMoro, the unions executive director, said in an interview. Hes real. Hes authentic. Thats why were supporting him., DeMoro said the 2016 Democratic primary should not be a coronation of Clinton, who in an average of several national polls holds a substantial lead over Sanders., He has a proven legislative record when it comes to progressive causes, DeMoro said of Sanders, an independent who has served in Congress since 1991., TRAIL GUIDE: After Black Lives Matter activists shut him down, Sandersheads to L.A., Sanders and Clinton are vying for support from big labor unions. Each appeared before the executive council of the AFL-CIO in Washington, D.C., last month to court support., In July, Clinton won support from the American Federation of Teachers, which was the first national union to back a candidate in the 2016 primary., Sanders has traveled the country much of the summer tapping into liberal grass-roots support., From Madison, Wis., to Seattle, staunchly liberal crowds intrigued by an alternative toClinton have arrived by the thousands to hearSandersspeak., Sanders,a self-described Democratic socialist, has put forth a populist message that would raise the federal minimum wage. He also proposed free tuition at public colleges and universities, at a cost of $70 billion.,  The Los Angeles rally comes on the heels of a weekend swing through Seattle and Portland, Ore., where record crowds gathered inside sports arenas. In recent months hes amassed the largest crowds of any candidate this election cycle -- 10,000 in Madison, 12,000 in Seattle on Saturday and a record 28,000 in Portland on Sunday, according to the campaign., Still, Clinton has focused little attention on him.Her status as a front-runneris solid in the Democratic primary, where an average of several national polls show her outpacing Sanders by 36 percentage points., Instead, she has focused her message on similar issues, expressing the need to uplift the middle class and address income inequality while jabbing top-tier Republicans such as former Florida Gov.Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio-- candidates she could face in the 2016 general election.,  Sanders, for the most part, has not directly criticized Clinton. But he has alluded to voters being weary of establishment politics, an indirect poke at the former secretary of State, who also served in the Senate and is a former first lady.,  \"All across this country, people are sick and tired of establishment politics, establishment economics, and they want real change, Sanders said in Seattle. The people ofAmerica understand that corporate greed is destroying our country.\", Lynn Vavreck, a professor of political science at UCLA, noted that its early in the election cycle., Just because people are interested, it does not mean people will give money and actually cast a ballot in support, Vavreck said. People showing up for these rallies have a strong interest in politics. Theyre not average voters, who are barely tuned into the election at this point.,  For Curtis Chin, the Vermont senator is appealing to progressives because he represents fundamental change. Chin lives in Los Angeles and is a member of Asian Americans for Bernie Sanders, an informal grass-roots group that is separate from the campaign., \"Hes really trying to change the system,\" Chin said. \"We need a government that works for the people, and I really think hell do it.\", Follow @kurtisalee for political news, , 12:12 p.m. This article was updated with information about an endorsement Sanders received., This article was originally published at 3 a.m.]", "Date": "20150810", "Title": "[Ahead of L.A. visit, Sanders captures support of National Nurses United]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-bernie-sanders-los-angeles-20150810-story.html", "Author": "[Kurtis Lee]"}
{"Content": "[[, A little-known pact that for years has spared Walt Disney Co. from paying entertainment tax on its Anaheim amusement parks may be extended for three decades if the entertainment giant agrees to invest at least $1 billion in its resort properties in the coming years., While supporters say they are encouraged that Disney will continue to expand in a city where Disneyland opened 60 years ago, critics say Disney is getting a special break that could put residents at risk if the citys financial circumstances take a downturn. , The current agreement that exempts Disney from paying an entertainment tax expires in 2016. The City Council will hold a hearing on the new pact July 7., The issue arises as the city prepares to switch next year to a district-based council election, which could dramatically change the face of a council that has typically had a cozy relationship with Disney., Under the new pact, the resort would be guaranteed reimbursement for any future entertainment tax levied in the next 30 years, so long as Disney invests at least $1 billion in the resort by 2024. If Disney invests an additional $500 million, the agreement could be extended 15 years., No institution in Anaheim currently pays an entertainment tax, but the agreement would provide an economic certainty for Disney as it weighs how and where to make its investments around the world, said Kristine Ridge, the citys interim assistant city manager. The company is preparing to open a $4.4-billion Disneyland in Shanghai next year., Disney officials said they approached Anaheim about extending the tax break so that executives could begin to discuss the future of Disneyland and California Adventure. Potential investments include traffic-flow improvements, a new 5,000-space parking garage and added attractions at the parks., The move does not signify immediate plans for an expansion of either park, nor the arrival of a hoped-for third theme park in Anaheims resort district. , Since Disney acquired Marvel Entertainment Inc. in 2009 and Lucasfilm in 2012, fans have speculated that an expansion may include Marvel superheroes or Star Wars characters. But Disney officials have remained tight-lipped about their plans., Anaheim has been an economic success story thanks to its policies and initiatives that allow businesses to invest and thrive, said Michael Colglazier, president of Disneyland Resort., We are asking city leaders to continue with a policy set two decades ago that has driven unprecedented job creation, growth and prosperity and enabled the city to invest in vital services that benefit every Anaheim resident., Ridge said Disneys investment would generate more revenue long-term for the city than a tax, though the city did not have a estimate of what an entertainment tax might generate., Mayor Tom Tait said Disney shouldnt get a break at the expense of residents future financial security. Making a deal with Disney, the mayor said, would prevent future city leaders from imposing an entertainment tax, even if the city faced financial desperation. , This is more than the City Council binding future City Councils, Tait said. It is the City Council binding future generations from even voting for a tax., Tait served on the City Council in 1996 when the original agreement was struck. He said he was wary of it then, and finds if even harder to swallow now. , In its statement, the city said that that agreement provided Disney the confidence to undertake significant investment by opening California Adventure, the Grand Californian Hotel and Spa and Downtown Disney., Following Disneys expansion beginning the late 1990s, the citys revenue from hotel stays nearly tripled, according to the citys statement., Since 1996, the resort also doubled its workforce, and attendance increased by nearly 60%. In the coming fiscal year, city officials estimate that more than half of its gross general fund revenue will come from the resorts hotel, sales, property and business license taxes., The resort accounts for 4% of the citys total acreage, but Disney businesses there are expected to provide $148 million to the citys general fund revenue, according to the citys budget for its 2016 fiscal year, starting Wednesday. Excluding city services provided, the budget expects $67 million will be left over., They already are the largest tax provider in the city, Councilwoman Kris Murray said. Not to tax them further in exchange for more than $1 billion in new investment is a good deal for the city., There is probably no doubt that Disney plans to spend $1 billion on its theme parks in the near future, so the tax exemption is simply a way for the city to show its support for Disney, said Dennis Speigel, president of International Theme Park Services in Cincinnati., emily.foxhall@latimes.com, hugo.martin@latimes.com, 6:30 p.m.: Updates with additional details, Originally posted at 12:35 p.m.]", "Date": "20150626", "Title": "[For $1-billion investment, Disney would be spared Anaheim tax for 30 years ]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-disney-tax-break-20150626-story.html", "Author": "[Hugo Martin]"}
{"Content": "[[, A Los Angeles-area lawmaker, Anthony Rendon, has been tapped to be the next state Assembly speaker, maintaining Southern Californias clout in the Capitol and signifying a generational shift in the highest ranks of the Legislature., The official vote to designate Rendon, a Democrat who lives in Lakewood, as speaker-elect will be in January. It is unclear when he will succeed the current speaker, Toni Atkins (D-San Diego)., Once Rendon takes command, both the Assembly and the Senate in the nations largest state will be led by Latinos for the first time, with Rendon joining Senate pro Tempore Kevin de Len, a fellow Democrat from Los Angeles., The political shuffle comes as lawmakers who now can serve as many as 12 years in one house rallied to elect one of their own before adjourning next week for the year. Rendon will be the first speaker to serve under the term limits that voters approved in 2012., Atkins, who was elected to the Legislature in 2010 and became speaker last year, was destined for a short tenure because of her 2016 term limit., The big advantage that my class has over previous classes is just the benefit of time, Rendon said. Being able to be here for a significant amount of time gives us the opportunity to sink our teeth not only into different policy areas, but into things like oversight., Rendon, who unsuccessfully ran for speaker against Atkins in 2014, could serve as speaker for nine years  longer than any lawmaker since Democrat Willie Brown, who reigned from 1980 to 1995., Brown, however, was an Assemblyman for more than 15 years before becoming speaker, honing the political skills and cunning that were the hallmarks of his long tenure as leader when there were no term limits. Rendon has served three years., Still, Rendon was able to put it together to get the job. That shows hes got the goods, said state Democratic Party Chairman John Burton, a former president pro tempore of the state Senate. But its going to be a little trial by error, and trial by fire., Democrat John Prez of Los Angeles, who was speaker from 2010 to 2014, said the change gives lawmakers enough breathing room to tackle some of Californias most complex issues and deliver on their own legislative priorities., The downside is that theres more time for lawmakers who may be eclipsed from favored committee assignments, or who are otherwise not happy with their own lot in life, to rebel against the leadership, he said., So the speaker has to juggle both those challenges and opportunities, Prez said., Rendons impending ascension follows major changes in GOP leadership in both houses., State Sen. Jean Fuller (R-Bakersfield) took over for Sen. Bob Huff (R-San Dimas) on Aug. 27, months earlier than expected. And freshman Assemblyman Chad Mayes (R-Yucca Valley) was designated the Assemblys minority leader-elect this week., In January, Mayes will take over the Assembly GOP caucus from the current leader, Kristin Olsen of Modesto. Mayes will be termed out in 2026., Both Huff and Olsen, precluded from running for reelection because of term limits, are eyeing other offices: Huff, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, and Olsen, a state Senate seat., Republican political consultant Rob Stutzman said that once a legislative leader starts running for another office, fellow party members start itching for new blood  a leader devoted to strengthening the caucus and not distracted by personal political ambitions., Once theyre a candidate for another office, their interests are just that  and not the caucus, Stutzman said., Among the Assembly Democrats, Atkins had tried to tamp down the incipient leadership upheaval during the final weeks of the session, asking members to sign a letter pledging to delay electing a new leader until January., But the jockeying continued., Theres been a little bit of a distraction, Atkins said, once the leadership race had ended. But that distraction is now done, for the good of this caucus and the good of this house., Rendons district includes Hawaiian Gardens, Bell and South Gate., Before his election in 2012, he was executive director of a nonprofit child-services organization.

{"Content": "[[, A mere two years after futilely shutting down much of the federal government in a doomed-from-the-start effort to defund Obamacare, congressional Republicans appear determined to force another shutdown in a doomed-from-the-start effort to defund Planned Parenthood. And with a few notable exceptions, the GOP presidential candidates have been cheering on this exercise in dysfunction., Republicans havent scored an outright win on Obamacare, taxes or virtually any other major issue since taking over the House in 2011  not even after they became the majority in the Senate this year. That experience is strengthening the impulse to dig in and fight now. As Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal put it during the warmup GOP debate at the Reagan Presidential Library on Wednesday, If we cant defund Planned Parenthood now, if we cant stand for innocent human life after these barbaric videos, it is time to be done with the Republican Party. Never mind that the barbaric videos are just a pretext to attack a group that social conservatives have long despised., The reality is that power remains divided and the parties polarized in the nations capital. Senate Democrats have enough members to filibuster any bill they dont like, and even when a disputed bill has made it through, President Obama has found enough allies in Congress to sustain a veto. Yet the GOPs tea party wing continues to agitate for more confrontation  for instance, by refusing to provide money for any government programs in fiscal 2016 unless every federal dollar for Planned Parenthood is cut off. If Republicans try to impose such a condition, theyll be met either with a Senate filibuster or a presidential veto, and the government will shut down., Assuming Congress finds a way around the Planned Parenthood impasse, the spending bills for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1 face a bigger problem. A 2011 budget law imposed what was known as the sequester, a set of tough spending caps that Republicans have now proposed to circumvent, but only for defense. Obama told lawmakers months ago that he would veto any spending bill that doesnt lift the caps for non-defense programs as well, yet theres been no progress toward a deal. In fact, Republicans have shown little interest even in negotiating., The two-week shutdown that Republicans forced in 2013 didnt seem to hurt the party in the 2014 election, so its possible that lawmakers may not see a downside in forcing another one. But doing so would not only hurt the thousands of federal workers and contractors whod receive no pay; it would deny constituents all nonessential services, such as housing subsidies, small-business loans and environmental reviews of construction projects. And worse, it would hit the brakes on the U.S. economy and rattle global markets.

{"Content": "[[, A month after Charles Munger Jr. wrote his first $100,000 check to a political campaign, he got a taste of the chronic rejection familiar to Californias big Republican donors: The 2005 ballot measure he backed lost by a landslide., Yet Munger, the son of a billionaire, went on to spend almost $78 million on scores of other campaigns., The spending by the Palo Alto physicist has thrust him into an unlikely role for a man whose occupation is to research the fine points of protons and electrons: He is a central force in the Republican Partys attempted comeback from its two-decade slide in California., \"If it werent for Charles Munger, the California Republican Party would have been driven into the sea at this point,\" said Kevin Spillane, a GOP strategist., A courtly academic who fancies bow ties and suspenders, Munger, 58, spent more than $11 million last year to help put Republicans in Congress and the Legislature, making him by far the state partys biggest benefactor. His funding of Latino, female and moderate candidates has been crucial to the partys effort to shed its image as a league of conservative white men., Mungers spending on ballot measures illuminates other priorities. He has tried to block tax hikes, diminish the power of labor unions and stop lawmakers from drafting election maps to their liking., The scale of Mungers spending has drawn scorn from adversaries. The state Fair Political Practices Commission is investigating Democrats allegations that Munger skirted donation limits last year by funneling money through the state party to favored candidates., \"Theres a lot of smoke there,\" said Lance Olson, a Democratic Party lawyer., Munger declined to be interviewed. \"My actions speak louder than any words I could give you,\" he said in an email., Labor leaders fault Munger not just for backing ballot measures that would have hindered unions spending on politics, but also for fighting Gov. Jerry Browns 2012 measure to raise taxes and avert cuts in, among other things, public schools. Munger, who served four years on a state curriculum panel, has lamented the quality of public education in California., \"You cant profess to care about the education of children, and then spend millions of dollars to ensure that the funding for those children is never realized,\" said Willie Pelote Sr., who oversees California political affairs for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees., Munger, a former Santa Clara County Republican Party chairman, has made enemies within his own party too, in part by bankrolling moderates in primaries against conservatives., He infuriated Orange County party leaders by spending more than $580,000 to try to bounce Republican Allan Mansoor from the state Assembly in 2012. The moderate Republican backed by Munger finished a distant third., Months later, his clash with conservatives spawned \"The Munger Games,\" a blog devoted to bashing what it calls a \"one-man maelstrom of money intent on remaking California Republicanism in his bow-tied image.\", Munger ally Harmeet Dhillon, state party vice chairman, scoffed at his critics, saying that he deserves credit for trying to rescue the party., \"Charles Munger made the cardinal sin of backing someone for Assembly who was not anointed by the Orange County machine as golden boy or girl,\" she said., Former state Republican Chairman Mike Schroeder, one of Mungers Orange County antagonists, said Munger was on \"a fools errand\" to mute the partys large conservative faction. \"Any time you try to purge one of the wings, you weaken the party,\" he said., At a 2013 conference at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Munger lamented the state partys failure to extend its reach beyond Republican rural and suburban areas., \"Its essentially been AWOL, as far as actually carrying a vision to try to convince people that Republican ideals and principles outside safe Republican [districts] actually matter and should matter,\" he said., Munger grew up in Hancock Park. He attended a local public school, Third Street Elementary, and a private high school, Harvard, now known as Harvard-Westlake., He is one of eight children of Charles T. Munger, 91, the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Corp. The familys roots are in Nebraska, where Mungers father met his business partner, Warren Buffett., When Munger was a child, the family spent summer vacations in Minnesota at the same rustic lakeside cabin where his father and grandfather had long taken fishing holidays., By the time Forbes listed his father as a billionaire, Munger was an adult. With net worth pegged at $1.3 billion, his father is ranked today as the worlds 1,415th richest person. He still lives in the North June Street house where Munger was raised., Adept at math and science, Munger earned a bachelors degree in physics at Stanford University and a doctorate in physics at UC Berkeley., \"My thesis topic was The Lamb Shift in Heliumlike Uranium,\" he said by email., Munger settled in Palo Alto, where he and his wife, attorney Charlotte Lowell, have raised three children. He has not held a paid job since his research appointment at Stanfords Linear Accelerator Center ended about 1992., Family wealth has enabled him \"to have the sort of scientific career usually supported by a salaried position at a national laboratory,\" he wrote. His work at particle accelerators \"will make no ones toaster more efficient but seeks to answer fundamental questions about the universe.\", What inspired him to enter politics, he told the audience at San Luis Obispo, was the 2005 special election called by Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. He liked Schwarzeneggers agenda  four ballot measures that would have curbed the power of unions and their Democratic allies., \"Governor,\" Munger recalled thinking after studying his ballot pamphlet, \"if this is where you want to take my state, you have just got yourself a soldier.\", Mungers first $100,000 donation was to back a Schwarzenegger proposal to take away state lawmakers power to draw election maps. Voters rejected it, along with the rest of the governors ballot measures., Munger went on to spend $14.2 million on other redistricting overhaul measures that succeeded, but an upcoming U.S. Supreme Court ruling threatens to restore lawmakers power over congressional maps., Most recently, Munger has turned to rebuilding the state party. For last years election, he gave the party $4.9 million  or 17% of what it raised, a huge share for a single donor. Munger also spent $6 million on campaigns to put Republicans in the Legislature, striking fear into Democrats., \"We kept having to move our chess pieces around because he would suddenly appear on the board in a big way,\" said Steve Maviglio, a Democratic strategist., Much of Mungers money went to losers. But his funding of a few winners  such as Assembly members Catharine Baker in the Bay Area and David Hadley in the South Bay  was critical in denying Democrats a legislative supermajority., With the $1.9 million he put behind moderates in Republican primaries last year, Munger also alarmed party operatives who prefer conservatives. Republican blogger Jon Fleischman said Mungers spending was deterring some conservatives from running., A campaign is less appealing, he said, when \"youre one heartbeat away from Charles Munger dropping $1 million on your head.\", michael.finnegan@latimes.com, maloy.moore@latimes.com, Twitter: @finneganLAT @maloym, Times staff writer Sandra Poindexter contributed to this report., Details on Mungers political spending are available at this link.]", "Date": "20150404", "Title": "[GOP donor Charles Munger Jr. finds wealth buys few friends]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-adv-munger-20150304-story.html", "Author": "[Michael Finnegan, Maloy Moore]"}

The researchers who conducted the study, who did not name the two schools, cautioned that their findings might not be applicable nationwide, but the figure has, nonetheless, been featured in presidential speeches, social media campaigns and numerous articles., The new survey, part of a series that the Institute of Politics has done on the attitudes and experiences of young Americans, reports that 11% of female respondents age 18 to 29 said they had been the victim of a sexual assault., Despite the attention focused on assaults on campus, the survey found that the rate of sexual assault was twice as highamong women who had not attended college than among college students., Among women age 18 to 29 who did not attend college, 12% said they had been sexually assaulted, while among those currently enrolled in college, 6% said they had been targets of such assaults., Of those who said they had been assaulted, 9% said the assault took place on a college or university campus., \"Its not just a college problem,\" said Mariel Klein, a Harvard sophomore who participated in conducting the survey.

The use of Web-based surveying, which provides more anonymity to respondents, may result in more accurate reporting of assaults, researchers believe., The one-in-five statistic from 2007 includes both completed and attempted sexual assaults.

California has become the third U.S. state where the Latino population outnumbers whites, according to U.S. Census data., \"There is a segment of people that will be attracted to Trump because of those comments,\" said Ira Kalb, assistant professor of clinical marketing at USCs business school. \"That segment is relatively small compared with the larger segment that will be offended by his comments or feel empathetic to those offended.\", His TV career is already hurting. Unless Trump apologizes, he can no longer appear on a TV series dependent on advertising dollars, like the reality show \"The Celebrity Apprentice,\" according to an NBC executive familiar with Trumps deal with the network., \"Hes toxic to NBC for sure,\" said the executive, pointing out that sponsors are quick to distance themselves from the kind of controversy Trump has generated., \"Every minority coalition in the world would be pounding on the doors of any network that would be in business with him,\" the executive added. \"Its just not worth it.\", NBC said Trump would no longer host \"The Celebrity Apprentice,\" for which he got paid around $250,000 to $300,000 an episode, the executive said., But Trump will continue making some money from TV, even if he never gets another second of screen time. Hes still a profit participant in \"The Celebrity Apprentice,\" so hell get paid if NBC produces another season., Through the Miss Universe Organization, Trump shares ownership of the pageant business with NBC. But the pageants were a break-even operation for Trump, netting him only several hundred thousand dollars a year, the NBC executive said., Trumps golf business is also in trouble. Trump National Golf Club Los Angeles in Rancho Palos Verdes will lose valuable TV exposure by losing PGAs Grand Slam of Golf in October., Golf courses open to the public such as the Trump National Golf Club are often able to command a hefty increase in fees after holding a major PGA event, according to one TV sports consultant, who wished to stay anonymous because he works for broadcast companies that carry PGA events., \"Golfers want to play the courses that they see on television,\" the consultant said. The PGA could also pull future events held on Trump golf courses, including the 2017 Senior PGA Championship and 2022 PGA Championship., Aside from sports, Trumps signature real estate could continue suffering aftershocks for years to come, analysts said., Luxury properties bearing his name, such as Trump Tower in New York City, have long been considered \"badges of arrival\" for those who could afford to live there, Belk of Siegel+Gale said., In the short term, Trump is protected by leases, but he will lose well-heeled tenants if he keeps sticking by his words, Belk said., \"Sophisticated and premium brands cant coexist with bigotry and racism,\" he said. \"Wealthy people who have a choice of where theyre going to live will remember.\", But other branding experts say that once the outrage blows over, Trump could bounce back with few permanent scars., Celebrities such as Michael Vick and Martha Stewart have all recovered  at least somewhat  from past scandals, said Johnson of Strategic Vision., \"The people who bought into his brand already know who he is,\" Johnson said. \"Hes loud and abrasive and obnoxious.

Latinos make up nearly half of the countys population., It took a voting rights lawsuit to create the first Latino-majority district on the board more than 20 years ago. That seat is now held by former U.S. Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis, who declined to comment on Mendozas proposal., Because of term limits, only twoof the sitting Los Angeles County supervisors -- Solis and Sheila Kuehl -- could potentially still be in officewhen the proposed expansion took effect. Kuehl also declined to comment on the proposal. According to a spokesman, Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich opposes the idea, and Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas could not be reached., Los Angeles County voters have several times rejected proposals to expand the number of seats on the board, which could potentially create a better opportunity to elect a second Latino member and a first Asian American member. Federal officials have so far not heeded calls byactivists seeking a second Latino seat to sue the county over alleged voting rights violations., Last year, Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed a proposalthat would have allowed courts to order an expansion of the number of county seats as a result of state voting rights lawsuits., Mendozas proposed constitutional amendment would expand the boards of all counties with a population of 2 million or more -- including the Southern California counties of Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino -- from five to seven members beginning in 2021. The counties redistricting processes would remain unchanged, and theirspending on supervisors staff and office operations would be capped at the same level as when they had five seats., State legislators would have to vote to place the proposal on the ballot and then California residents would vote on it in 2016., Redistricting expert Douglas Johnson said he thought the bills prospects of passing were slim. But it might pick up support from Republicans concerned about losing the two existing conservative seats on the Los Angeles County board in next years election, he said.Mendozas bill has one Republican co-author, state Sen. Sharon Runner of Lancaster, along with several Democrats., Maybe Republicans would join with Latinos in hopes that if we go to seven, we might preserve one Republican seat and get two Latino seats, Johnsonsaid., Mendoza said he had been in talks with advocacy organizations such as the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund -- one of the groups that successfully sued Los Angeles County to create a first Latino district -- and was hopeful of garnering their support for his proposal.

{"Content": "[[, A split federal appeals court on Tuesday let stand a lower courts ruling that has stymied Obama administration plans to shield up to 5 million people - including young immigrants known as \"Dreamers\"  from deportation., At issue was President Obamas proposed extension of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, created in 2012, and the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Legal Permanent Residents, or DAPA, which was scheduled to start in May., Although the programs do not create a path to citizenship, critics have labeled them amnesty, and on Tuesday they praised the 2-1 ruling from the New Orleans-based appellate court., Texas just won the executive amnesty case at the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. The Constitution wins, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a vocal critic of Obamas immigration policies, wrote in a tweet., Twenty-six states, led by Texas, had sued to stop the programs, arguing that the president had overstepped his constitutional authority. Judges Jerry E. Smith and Jennifer Walker Elrod agreed. They also found that Texas officials could suffer a cognizable injury from the cost of having to issue drivers licenses to at least 500,000 people that might be covered under the executive action., Smith was appointed by President Reagan and Elrod by President George W. Bush. Judge Stephen A. Higginson, who dissented, was appointed by Obama. The White House noted his dissent Tuesday., Today, two judges of the 5th Circuit chose to misinterpret the facts and the law in denying the governments request for a stay, said Brandi Hoffine, a White House spokeswoman. As the powerful dissent from Judge Higginson recognizes, President Obamas immigration executive actions are fully consistent with the law., She insisted that Obamas actions were within his authority and cited the 15 states, the District of Columbia and other constituencies that have joined the administration in asking the courts that Obamas immigration programs be allowed to move ahead., The Justice Department is evaluating the ruling and will consider its next steps while its appeal of the preliminary injunction proceeds on an expedited basis in the 5th Circuit, administration officials said., Obama announced last fall that he was using his executive power to grant three-year work permits and temporary protection from deportation to about 4 million adults who are parents of U.S. citizens and have lived in the country for at least five years. He said the DAPA program was an extension of his authority to prioritize immigration enforcement., DACA allows young people brought into the United States illegally as children to apply for deportation deferrals and work permits., The case will probably end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, immigrant rights advocates told the media during a news conference Tuesday. The legal wrangling means that immigration officials would probably have just a few months to launch and implement the programs before the 2016 elections if the courts approve it., Presidential candidates may be placed in the dicey position of having to answer whether they would keep and extend the programs if elected, said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the Los Angeles-based National Immigration Law Center., We know that U.S. citizen family members, neighbors and friends will vote with that in mind, she said. Will [the candidate] be supportive of extending this executive action?\", If the programs survive the courts and are implemented, a question still looms: Will immigrants who qualify be willing to apply and identify themselves to federal officials if there is the potential that the next person in the White House might scrap Obamas efforts and take an enforcement-only approach to illegal immigration?, In February, U.S. District Judge Andrew S. Hanen, sitting in Brownsville, Texas, issued an injunction putting the programs on hold. His action came in response to the suit filed by the 26 states. Tuesdays ruling comes after the appeals court panel held an unusual 2-hour hearing April 17 on the administrations request to stay the injunction., The panels action drew praise and scorn., \"U.S. immigration laws should be respected and enforced,\" Robin Hvidston, executive director of We The People Rising, said in a statement. President Obama should focus his energy upon the needs of U.S. citizens, and assist Americans who are unemployed, homeless, families in poverty, veterans and the disabled, not individuals in the USA illegally.\", Lee Gelernt, an ACLU attorney, said in an interview that the ruling would \"cause needless hardship to thousands of law-abiding families. The federal program is consistent with congressional intent and the Constitution and the states have no business trying to enjoin this program., Fifteen states, including California, had filed briefs arguing on behalf of Obamas executive actions., Appearing on behalf of the federal government before the panel in New Orleans, Benjamin C. Mizer, acting assistant U.S. attorney general and a former Ohio solicitor general, failed to persuade the justices that states lacked standing to challenge the federal programs., The panel appeared to have been swayed by Scott Keller, Texas solicitor general, who argued that Obama bypassed Congress to create a policy of deferred action that the states were forced to follow without proper administrative notice., Nora Preciado, staff attorney with the National Immigration Law Center in Los Angeles, which filed a brief in support of the federal governments case, had hoped the panel would rule in their favor., Were disappointed, but we will continue to make sure this matter moves forward, she said.

{"Content": "[[, A week from Tuesday, voters will choose an entirely new House of Representatives, a third of the U.S. Senate and the governors of 36 states. Lamentably, many qualified voters will stay home, some out of apathy or disillusionment but others because they lack the right sort of identification. In Texas, thanks to an outrageous order by the Supreme Court, voters will have to display a photo ID under a law that a lower court judge concluded was a deliberate attempt to disenfranchise blacks and Latinos, who disproportionately lack such identification., Welcome to the new world of voter suppression, the culmination of a sustained effort by mostly Republican state legislators to make it harder for Americans to exercise the most basic right afforded to citizens in a democracy. Its an effort whose effect, if not its intent, has been to reduce the participation at the ballot box by groups that historically have been the victims of discrimination. It has been abetted by a Supreme Court that blithely gutted an important section of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act and by a Congress that has been to slow to undo the damage caused by the court., What is most galling about the wave of photo ID laws is that they have been justified by high-minded Republican arguments about the importance of rooting out voter fraud, which indeed would threaten the integrity of the electoral process  if it existed. But impersonation at the polling place is an exotic if not imaginary phenomenon. In her decision invalidating Texas photo ID law, U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos noted that the record showed only four instances of impersonation in Texas., Despite Ramos conclusion that Texas photo ID violated the Voting Rights Act and the U.S. Constitution, voters there on Nov. 4 will have to present a photo ID anyway. Thats because the U.S. Supreme Court refused to lift a stay placed on Ramos decision by a federal appeals court pending an appeal., Meanwhile, voters are being inconvenienced  and worse  by other laws that make it harder to vote. And the Republican Party shows no sign of relenting in its campaign to make voting more difficult, especially for the low-income and minority voters who tend to support Democrats., What can be done?, The Supreme Court bears considerable responsibility for the obstacles being placed in the way of voting, and it could do much to remove them. In 2013, a narrow, five-member majority declared unconstitutional the formula in the Voting Rights Act under which states with a history of racial discrimination in voting had to pre-clear changes in their election procedures with the Justice Department or a federal court in Washington. The majority thought the formula relied too much on out-of-date information, but under the Constitution that was Congress call to make. Before the courts decision, a federal court had blocked the Texas law., The court is unlikely to revisit its decision about pre-clearance of elections laws. But it could redeem itself somewhat by rethinking the approval it extended to photo ID laws in a 2008 decision from Indiana. In the lead opinion in that case, Justice John Paul Stevens exaggerated the justification for the photo ID requirement while minimizing the hardship incurred by voters who lacked IDs. Subsequent events have vindicated the dissenters in that case., But whether or not the court acts, Congress can move to rein in voter suppression. This year, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) and Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) proposed legislation that would provide for pre-clearance of election procedures in any state with a history of discrimination. That would go a long way toward reinvigorating the Voting Rights Act. But one section of the bill exempts photo ID requirements from its list of violations. That loophole must be closed., The problem, of course, is that congressional action to prevent the use of photos IDs to suppress the vote would require Republicans in Congress to distance themselves from the tactics of their counterparts in state legislatures around the country. But with the 2016 presidential election approaching  an election in which the GOP nominee may need a modicum of support from the very same minority voters the party has been trying to marginalize support for easier access to the ballot box might be good politics as well as good government., Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion]", "Date": "20141027", "Title": "[The new world of voter suppression ]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-votingrights-20141027-story.html", "Author": "[The Times Editorial Board]"}
{"Content": "[[, A year after the Internal Revenue Service was found to be targeting conservative groups and others seeking tax-exempt status, the scandal has erupted again with disclosures that the agency lost thousands of emails from a former official at the center of the controversy., IRS Commissioner John Koskinen disclosed June 13 that emails sent by Lois Lerner, the former director of the IRS division that oversaw tax-exempt groups, were lost when her computer hard drive crashed in mid-2011. This week, Koskinen told Congress that eight other hard drives from potential recipients had crashed as well., Republicans have seized on the missing emails, alleging in hearings by two House committees that their disappearance is evidence of a coverup by the IRS and that the White House might be trying to conceal its involvement in a politically inspired scheme to target conservative nonprofits., The Treasury Departments inspector general for tax administration said last year that the IRS actions appeared to be the result of low-level incompetence, rather than political bias. , Koskinen contends that the IRS is nonpolitical and says the agency is still working to retrieve the emails., I dont believe it, Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) told Koskinen on Friday. Thats your problem. Nobody believes you., The hearings continue. On Tuesday, David Ferriero, the head of the National Archives, said during a hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that the IRS did not follow the law when officials failed to report the loss of the emails, as required by the Federal Records Act., Here are some questions and answers about the continuing scandal:, Whats so important about Lois Lerners emails?, Lerners office that handled applications from 501(c)4 nonprofit groups that have raised and spent vast amounts during election campaigns since 2010. The IRS scandal broke in May 2013 after it was revealed that a regional branch office under Lerner was setting aside applications for tax-exempt status from groups identified using terms such as \"tea party\" or \"patriot. Some progressive groups were flagged as well. Republicans want to see who was communicating with Lerner before and during that time., What happened to the emails?, The IRS has turned over 30,000 emails from Lerners account and from others who received the messages. But the agency has been unable to recover some emails written before her computer crashed in June 2011. Emails written that summer show that IRS technical staff, including experts in the criminal division, were unable to retrieve the files. Thanks for trying. Sometimes stuff just happens, Lerner wrote to one staffer. The hard drive was sent to a recycling company and destroyed., So wasnt there a backup?, There was, but the backup tapes were recycled after six months, Koskinen said, and the agency didnt try to recover Lerners emails from the tapes at the time. Budget cuts left the IRS with aging computer systems that limited the size of employees inboxes and lacked the capability to archive everybodys emails, he said. The agency decided it couldnt afford the estimated $10 million it would cost to upgrade the system, he added.,  Is there anything else the agency can do to recover the emails?, The IRS has been trying to recreate Lerners emails by searching other accounts, and it has found about 24,000. But last week, Koskinen revealed that seven other hard drives had failed in the search time frame, from Jan. 2009 to April 2011, and an eighth crashed in February 2014. Its not yet clear whether any files can be recovered from those drives., Why are Republicans claimingfoul play?, Lerners hard drives crashed two years before the inspector general issued its May 2013 finding that the IRS was scrutinizing nonprofit applications using improper procedures., But Republicans point out that the IRS was on notice well before then that lawmakers had suspicions about the agencys conduct. They cite a June 2011 letter from Rep. Dave Camp (R-Mich.), chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Camp, inquiring in an unrelated inquiry about whether 501(c)4 groups would be charged gift tax, wrote that the IRS appears to have selectively targeted certain taxpayers who are engaged in political speech., When did the IRS learn about the lost emails?, The agency learned of the problem in February. But Koskinen said he didnt say anything until this month when the agency completed its investigation into the email glitch. Republicans, predictably, are furious at the delay.,  What has Lerner said about all this?, Lerner, fired from the agency last year, has invoked her 5th Amendment right not to testify while the matter is under criminal investigation.,  Whats the White House involvement?, So far no evidence has surfaced that the White House directed the IRS effort. Last week, the administration announced that it had found no direct emails between Lerner and officials in the White House., Twitter: @JTanfani, This has been updated to make clear that the IRS hearings continued Tuesday.]", "Date": "20140624", "Title": "[Thousands of missing emails at IRS: What's it all about?]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-irs-emails-20140624-story.html", "Author": "[Joseph Tanfani]"}

Michael Conway (R-Texas), who teared up Friday while describing a citizenship ceremony he attended for 28 returning military members who had served in Iraq., Think of it as a two-part strategy: Republicans will continue trying to stop President Obamas executive actions, as they did earlier this week with a House vote to undo the administrations efforts to defer deportations for up to 5 million immigrant youths and parents., At the same time, Republicans want to press forward with their own ideas for immigration., First up will be a tough border security measure coming from Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, who plans to unveil his beefed-up bill soon., If that legislation advances, watch for next steps -- perhaps efforts to craft guest farm worker programs, expand high-tech visas and clamp down on employers who hire immigrants without legal status., This is the step-by-step approach that Republican leaders wanted to launch last year, but failed to deliver -- in part because of concern from their most conservative members that any immigration bill would lead to amnesty for the 11 million immigrants in the country illegally., These comprehensive plans are never going to wash, said Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.), who was among those who led last weeks effort to stop Obamas plans. Until our borders are secure, we shouldnt be talking about any other immigration bills.\", Leaders did not expect to start the new year with an immigration debate., But with Congress at a standoff over $39.7 billion for the Homeland Security Department, which runs out of money next month, the time is ripe for an immigration debate., Politically, Republicans could benefit if they are able to show leadership on an issue that is important to the Latino and minority voters the party hopes to attract heading into the 2016 presidential election., But the GOP also faces grave risks if it pursues only tough enforcement measures that perpetuate the image of the party as being unwelcoming to immigrants., Advocates for immigration overhaul have long warned against a piecemeal approach that clamps down on the border and employers, but does little to address the 11 million who are living in the shadows without legal status., Thats the last thing that we should be thinking about, said Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho), an attorney who has worked on immigration issues. Theres a consensus on the first step., Republicans say they will take it slowly and see where the debate leads.

{"Content": "[[, A year before Republican voters begin winnowing an expansive field of presidential candidates, well-funded potential contenders such as 2012 nominee Mitt Romney and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush are battling over donors and supporters as they edge toward a decision to run, overshadowing the also-rans even before they enter the race., Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker on Thursday made a none-too-subtle argument to Republicans gathered here that the partys success depended on selecting someone else  someone with a proven track record and big bold ideas, a new fresh leader  someone with a profile precisely like his., He recounted his political victories  an election, the blunting of a recall attempt and a reelection, three successes in four years. He boasted of his opposition to abortion rights, his gun rights positions, his fights with public labor unions that won him national acclaim among Republicans. He made predictable gibes at President Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton, the still-undeclared Democratic front-runner in 2016., But his essential argument was less one of fiery objection to his partys opponents than the assertion that his resolute action at the state level provided a template for success in a White House run., Common sense reforms  a phrase he used repeatedly  can work not just in Wisconsin but they can work all across America, he said., The Republican National Committee gathering, which concludes Saturday, comes at a time of both enthusiasm and nervousness for the party. Buoyed by their takeover of the Senate in November, Republicans nonetheless look ahead to a presidential election landscape far less hospitable, given the traditional influx of Democratic-leaning voters., Although he did not mention his potential rivals by name, Walker strongly suggested that the party needed to break with the past  which both Romney and Bush represent  if it is to lessen the odds of a third straight presidential defeat., We got elected for the third time in four years, he said of his November victory. We can do it in a swing state like Wisconsin, we can do it anywhere., Although he repeatedly called for lower taxes, a position he indicated would be a de rigueur element of any presidential campaign, Walker did not mention a topic of high political interest back home  a budget deficit that is expected to grow to more than $2 billion within two years., Instead, he repeatedly played his Wisconsin roots off the national disdain for all things Washington, and asserted that Clinton, if she runs, would suffer for all the time she has spent in the nations capital., One of the things I picked up loud and clear from our state  is that people dont care much for Washington, he said. In November, he added, the big loser wasnt just the president, it was Washington., Clintons varied experiences  the bulwark of her argument for the White House  are her downfall, he suggested., The reason Hillary Clinton was a big loser is that she embodies Washington, she lives in Washington.  You look at everything people dislike about Washington, she embodies it, he said., The answers to the ailments of our nation do not come out of our nations capital., Although he opened his remarks by thanking the audience for its prayers, particularly during the anger-filled recall, Walkers speech amounted to a more secular approach to the partys future avenues for success than that forwarded earlier in the day by retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, a popular GOP speaker who also is considering a presidential bid., As he argued that Republicans had to avoid being cowed by political correctness, Carson defended conservative positions on same-sex marriage, Obamacare andthe presidents tactics and blamed the media for ostensibly targeting him. (He did acknowledge the accuracy of past articles detailing acts of plagiarism in his book.), We must be willing to stand up for what we believe in, he told a luncheon audience., The party activists will hear Friday from two potential presidential candidates, as outgoing Texas Gov. Rick Perry headlines a lunch event and Romney speaks in the evening from aboard the USS Midway in San Diego Harbor. It will be Romneys first public address since he began spreading the word last week that he might run for president for a third time in 2016., For political news and analysis, follow me on Twitter: @cathleendecker , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ]", "Date": "20150115", "Title": "[GOP's Scott Walker proposes 2016 nominee like Scott Walker]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-gov-scott-walker-2016-nominee-20150115-story.html", "Author": "[Cathleen Decker]"}
{"Content": "[[, Abraham Lincolns Emancipation Proclamation provides the foundational precedent for President Obamas executive order on immigrants in the country illegally., Before Lincoln issued his pronouncement in September 1862, congressional majorities had expressly affirmed that the war effort only aimed to preserve the Union without overthrowing  established institutions in the rebel states. The proclamation was an act of executive unilateralism, and as Obama has done in his order, Lincoln limited its scope in recognition of this fact. As a result, both proclamations serve only to initiate, rather than preempt, further democratic debate and decision., Lincoln did not try to free any blacks in the four slave states that remained loyal to the Union. Nor did he even liberate slaves in the Southern areas under federal control. Instead, the proclamation only affected those areas that remained in active rebellion on New Years Day 1863., Even where it applied, it did not commit the country to unconditional emancipation. Lincoln acted only in the name of military necessity, leaving it unclear whether Southern states could constitutionally reinstate slavery once the fighting came to an end. As the war wound down, many wanted to defer this issue for at least five years. But the proclamation prevented this evasion, forcing the question to the center of public attention., Congress first moment of truth came before the 1864 elections, when the 13th Amendment, which would authoritatively free the slaves, came to the floor. But in April 1864, the House rejected the measure. By voting no, Democrats sympathetic to the South deprived the initiative of the requisite two-thirds majority., The Democrats decision made the emancipation amendment a central issue in the November elections  with their presidential candidate, Gen. George McClellan, supporting his partys congressional position throughout the fall campaign. The Democrats changed their tune only after their decisive defeat at the polls by Lincolns Republicans. When the 13th Amendment returned for consideration during the lame duck session of Congress, enough Democrats changed their votes to give the initiative the two-thirds majority required to send it onward to the states., The subsequent enactment of the amendment, however, did not conclude the debate that Lincoln had begun. In his proclamation, he promised to recommend that all loyal citizens be compensated for all losses including the loss of slaves. This recommendation provoked a further round of argument that only ended in 1868 when the 14th Amendment rejected Lincolns proposal, expressly denying all compensation to slaveholders for their newly emancipated freedmen., Particulars in Obamas proclamation may well be changed by Americans over time. But like Lincolns, its provisional and limited character will have a democracy-forcing effect  spurring officials and citizens to more actively engage in a constitutional dialogue., Rather than refusing to follow the Constitution and take care that the laws be faithfully executed, the president emphasizes that he will continue deportations, using all the budgetary resources Congress has provided. But those appropriations cover the annual removal of only 400,000 of the 11.3 million immigrants in the country illegally. Given this fact, Obamas initiative has a constitutionally legitimate purpose: to prevent Homeland Security from wasting its scarce resources on breaking up innocent families when it could be targeting immigrants who deserve expeditious removal., This constrained exercise of constitutional and statutory discretion will force both political parties down Lincolns path, requiring tough decisions they might otherwise evade: Will the Republican candidates for president and Congress, like the Democrats in 1864, run their next campaign on a platform repudiating Obamas proclamation? If so, will the Democrats of 2016 defend it? If so, how will voters respond?, The democracy-forcing aspect of Obamas initiative distinguishes it from other recent exercises in executive unilateralism. The presidents decision to begin an open-ended war against Islamic State, for example, represents the imperial presidency at its worst. It is neither conditional nor provisional., To the contrary, Obama is ignoring the War Power Acts explicit requirement that presidents gain congressional assent to their initiation of hostilities within 60 days. Rather than provoking debate, his assertion of power allows Congress to defer a considered decision on the war to the indefinite future. Serious constitutionalists should oppose such unilateralist assertions as a breach of fundamental principle., But they should not confuse the issue by denouncing the president as imperial when he is engaging in democracy-enhancing actions fully consistent with his obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed., Bruce Ackerman, a professor of law and political science at Yale, is the author of \"We the People: The Civil Rights Revolution.\", Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion]", "Date": "20141121", "Title": "[Like the Emancipation Proclamation, Obama's order forces democracy]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-ackerman-obama-immigration-20141123-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, Afghanistans approval Tuesday of a continued U.S. and NATO troop presence gives the Pentagon at least two more years to train Afghan troops and conduct targeted strikes against Taliban insurgents who have stepped up attacks in key parts of the country., Signing the security agreement was one of the first acts of Afghan President Ashraf Ghanis new government, and is likely to help repair Kabuls long-strained relations with Washington., I assure all Afghans that this agreement is in our national interest, Ghani, who took office Monday, said after the signing ceremony at the presidential palace. Keeping foreign troops in Afghanistan would not be an obstacle to peace, he said., But the deals tortuous path to approval reflects ambivalence among both U.S. and Afghan officials about continuing a 13-year military relationship that began with a U.S.-led invasion after the Sept. 11 attacks., The joint effort has brought relative stability to much of Afghanistan. But the insurgency is undefeated and even resurgent in parts of the east and south., President Obama has approved keeping 9,800 U.S. troops in Afghanistan after the end of the year to continue training, advising and equipping Afghan soldiers and police, and to carry out counter-terrorism operations against what Obama called the remnants of Al Qaeda., In a statement, Obama said the accord would allow the U.S. and Afghanistan to cement an enduring partnership that strengthens Afghan sovereignty, stability, unity and prosperity, and that contributes to our shared goal of defeating Al Qaeda and its extremist affiliates., An additional 2,000 soldiers from other NATO countries are also due to remain., Senior U.S. officials said Tuesday that it was unclear how much military assistance Afghanistan will continue to receive, and for how long., The Obama administration has not decided whether it will continue to assist the Afghan army with military capabilities that it lacks, such as air cover from U.S. warplanes, evacuation of Afghans wounded on the battlefield, and intelligence and surveillance, usually provided by U.S. drones., Providing such capabilities is still a matter of discussion, said a senior State Department official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal administration deliberations., The Pentagon plan calls for positioning the 9,800 U.S. troops at as many as nine bases in eastern and southern Afghanistan and around Kabul, the capital, officials said., About 2,000 Americans would carry out counter-terrorism operations and the rest would train and advise Afghan forces, officials said., But the force would soon shrink. Obama wants a maximum of 6,000 troops by the end of 2015, and 1,000 by the end of 2016. That gives the Pentagon a relatively short period to continue training Afghan soldiers and police, officials conceded., Fearing that security could worsen if the U.S. pulls out too quickly, Pentagon officials hope the White House will ease the drawdown requirements over the next year, rather than face the possibility of having to send military forces back, as has happened in Iraq., U.S. officials also are unsure whether North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies who have pledged to provide troops for the post-2014 mission will send the forces they promised, especially now that some of those countries have joined the airstrikes or are otherwise focused on Islamic State militants in Iraq., The biggest question mark is Turkey, which has pledged to help train and advise Afghan troops around Kabul, but has not yet approved sending the troops. Italy and Germany are expected to lead the NATO training effort in western and northern Afghanistan., But the delay in getting Afghan approval means some European governments may not be able to meet the timetable, officials said., The U.S. has 33,000 troops in Afghanistan; many European countries that were expected to join the post-2014 mission already have pulled out most of their forces., At least as important to Ghanis government is aid from Washington. Now that the deal has been signed, officials said, more than $5 billion a year for the Afghan military and nearly $2 billion in civilian aid are likely to continue to flow, but steadily diminish., The security agreement was to have been signed last year after a loya jirga, or grand assembly of influential Afghans, approved the text. But then-President Hamid Karzai refused, arguing that U.S. forces continued to raid homes of noncombatants, causing civilian casualties., Opposition to letting U.S. troops stay is especially strong in the southern province of Kandahar, where Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales killed 16 villagers in a 2012 rampage, one of the worst cases of civilian killings of the war., A U.S. military court sentenced Bales to life in prison, angering many in Kandahar who thought his crimes warranted the death penalty., Special correspondent Latifi reported from Kabul and Times staff writer Cloud from Washington.

{"Content": "[[, After 14 years in Congress, Rep. Adam Schiff of Burbank is finally getting the kind of coverage that ambitious politicians crave: CBS, NBC, Fox, CNN, MSNBC and NPR have all come calling in recent weeks., Schiffs newly acquired media platform  he was named ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee in January  could serve him well if he runs for the U.S. Senate seat that fellow Democrat Barbara Boxer plans to vacate., But Schiffs high profile on foreign affairs, if not his whole career in elective office, is exactly what he would be forced to relinquish if he runs for the Senate and loses. Hes trying to decide whether its worth it., Two other Democrats, Reps. Xavier Becerra of Los Angeles and Loretta Sanchez of Garden Grove, are making similar calculations as they weigh whether to enter the race for a rare open Senate post in California. House members cannot seek reelection and run for another office at the same time., \"Theyre all on the cusp of fairly significant seniority in the House, and they would be giving that up,\" said John Lawrence, a retired chief of staff for Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi who spent 38 years on Capitol Hill. \"The question is: Would they be giving that up for a reasonable shot in the Senate?\", Schiff, 54; Becerra, 57; and Sanchez, 55, have collectively spent 54 years elbowing their way to higher standing in the House. Theyve been waiting for colleagues to retire so they can move up, and they still face the constant threat that even after biding their time, rivals could outmaneuver them., But with scant hope that Democrats could seize control of the House next year, they are also stuck in the relatively powerless minority. Democrats stand a better chance of retaking the Senate, so the potential leap may be that much more tempting., For now, the leading rival for anyone who enters the Senate race would be state Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, a Democrat who launched her campaign in January., Harris may be tough to beat. She has won two statewide elections. Her job as the states top prosecutor keeps her in the news on topics that she can hand-pick to maximize political gain., She might end up being the only prominent woman in the race, a significant edge in a state where women tend to vote in bigger numbers than men. And her support is especially strong in the Bay Area, where she was San Francisco district attorney from 2004 to 2011., Yet many Californians still have little or no impression of Harris  she is unknown by more than half the states registered voters, according to a recent USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll. That leaves an opening for any opponent who can afford large-scale advertising., Harris \"early start might give her an edge,\" said Larry Tramutola, a Democratic strategist in Oakland. But \"it kind of has more to do with your ability to connect with voters and to articulate your vision of why you ought to be elected.\", Rocky Chavez, a Republican state assemblyman from Oceanside, also is running for Senate. But hell be fighting Californias strong Democratic tilt, which makes it hard for any Republican to raise money for a statewide campaign., Schiff, who had more than $2.1 million in the bank at the end of December, was appointed by Pelosi to the intelligence post on Jan. 8, the same day Boxer announced she would retire. Its an unusually powerful spot for a Democrat in the House because of the committees bipartisan tradition., Schiff is also a leading Democrat on the committee investigating the attack in Benghazi, Libya, giving him a perch on what is likely to be a flashpoint issue in the 2016 presidential race. In an interview, Schiff said he would decide by the end of May whether to run for the Senate., \"Thats a bit of a dilemma,\" he said. \"I love the intel work on the one hand. But on the other hand, these opportunities dont come up very often. And the fields wide open for a candidate from the southern half of the state.\", Becerra holds the No. 4 position among Democrats in the House, making him a viable contender to succeed Pelosi, or one of her top two deputies, should they retire. All three leaders above him are in their 70s., At the Capitol in Washington this week, Becerra stood before a row of flags to introduce Pelosi at a news briefing. Pelosi would not say whether she wanted Becerra or any other House members to seek Boxers seat., Becerra, who finished 2014 with $1.3 million in campaign cash, said he would decide on the Senate contest in the next few months., \"For me its an interesting question because, being  high-ranking in leadership, I have an opportunity to make a difference for my state of California and my city of Los Angeles already,\" he said., Sanchez, who ended the year with about $392,000, is the second ranking Democrat on two key committees, Armed Services and Homeland Security., \"Its not really about, Oh gosh, Im losing something,\" Sanchez said. \"Its really about the opportunity to gain more ability to work on the issues I care about.\", Sanchez said she expects to make a decision in four to six weeks. One added pressure for her: She said House Democratic leaders are concerned that her Orange County House seat would be the toughest among the three to defend if she stepped aside., But Sanchez said she believes shed do better than House colleagues looking at the Senate contest., \"They can kid themselves as much as they like,\" she said. \"Then its about: Can you raise the money? Can you do the work? Will you catch fire?\", She, Becerra or Chavez would be Californias first Latino in the Senate, a potentially major asset. Still, like Schiff, the two Democrats would face serious obstacles in a vast state with 53 House members, most of them unfamiliar to voters outside their districts., \"Each of us is relatively well-known in 1/53 of the state,\" said Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks). \"Thats what you start with.\", The House members also would have to balance their Washington duties with the rigors of campaigning in a state five hours away by plane., Henry Waxman, who retired in January after 40 years representing the Westside in the House, said the demands of raising money and traveling around California make a Senate campaign a full-time job, and that means giving up on policy goals in the House., \"In a state like California, its like running for president of the United States,\" he said. \"And thats very different for all three of them than legislating and being active in the policy area.\", Whatever the challenges, a competitive Senate contest remains possible for candidates who can raise money and develop an effective message, said Bill Carrick, a longtime strategist for Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein., \"Early reads on these races can be very misleading,\" he said., michael.finnegan@latimes.com, Twitter: @finneganLAT, noah.bierman@latimes.com, Twitter: @Noahbierman, Finnegan reported from Los Angeles, Bierman from Washington.]", "Date": "20150320", "Title": "[State's congressional leaders weigh risking their power for Senate run]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-pol-senate-candidates-20150320-story.html", "Author": "[Michael Finnegan, Noah Bierman ]"}
{"Content": "[[, After a disappointing round of talks ended last week in Hawaii without resolution, negotiators of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership are hoping to meet later this month to try again to wrap up one of the worlds biggest free-trade agreements., Between now and then, negotiators have their work cut out for them: They need to iron out tough issues on the length of drug patents, so-called rules of origin for autos and, perhaps most intractable of all, market access for dairy goods  something particularly important for California, Americas biggest dairy-producing state., Even if the U.S. and 11 other Pacific Rim nations can bring the deal to the finish line this month, its almost certain now that an accord wont reach Congress for a vote until next year, in the thick of the presidential campaign., Just what that means for the outcome of a trade agreement that would cover 40% of the global economy is debatable. Conventional thinking is that in a presidential election year, Congress will punt on politically sensitive matters like free trade, particularly because it has split the Democratic Party., Analysts point out that most lawmakers already made their positions public when they cast votes in June to grant fast-track authority, or expanded trade-negotiating powers, to the president., \"Whether its November 2015 or February 2016 [when Congress votes on it] doesnt make a whit of difference,\" said Jim Kessler, senior vice president for policy at Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank that is behind the Trans-Pacific Partnership., But others, even proponents of the deal, arent so sure. \"The trade debate has become so toxic, particularly in the Democratic Party, that its harder to predict the outcome in an election year,\" said William Reinsch, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, a pro-trade group representing scores of multinational corporations., How that debate in Congress and the public evolves will depend on the final trade agreement  and that is still an open question., NEWSLETTER:Get the days top headlines from Times Editor Davan Maharaj >>, Despite the failure to conclude an agreement in Maui last week, Obama administration officials have remained upbeat about the Trans-Pacific Partnership  the economic linchpin of Obamas strategy to shift more focus to Asia-Pacific in the face of Chinas rising power., Secretary of State John F. Kerry, in Singapore on Tuesday, hailed what he called \"good progress\" made during the meetings last week. In his speech, Kerry expressed confidence that the trade agreement will promote economic opportunities and a \"stable, rules-based order for the Asia Pacific.\" Singapore is one of the 12 member nations in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, along with the U.S., Japan, Canada, Australia, Mexico, Malaysia, Chile, Peru, New Zealand, Vietnam and Brunei., Deborah Elms, a trade specialist in Singapore, called the Hawaii meetings a big letdown given the expectations that a final agreement would be reached., \"I think the plan was to have John Kerry to do a victory lap in Singapore  to say that the pivot [to Asia] is here,\" said Elms, executive director of the Asian Trade Center, a research and consulting firm. If the next round of talks happens in conjunction with the Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations meeting in Malaysia on Aug. 22 to 25, as is being discussed, Elms said she doubted there was enough time to resolve their differences., The battle over dairy goods, which are protected by governments around the world, is fraught with domestic political considerations. With national elections in October, Canadas ruling Conservative Party has been reluctant to open up its dairy market. The nations offer in Hawaii was far from what was sought by Australia and New Zealand, a major dairy exporter. Canadas hard line in turn prompted the U.S. to resist liberalizing its market. And the dominoes tipped over to Japan too, which didnt want to widen its dairy market when other offers were uncertain., \"Without access to Canada and Japan, its going to cause serious harm\" to American producers, said Cornell Kasbergen, who milks 3,000 cows in Californias Tulare County and owns a dairy operation in Wisconsin with his brother., Things have been rough for Kasbergen and other dairy producers in drought-pinched California. With demand from China down, he said, \"milk prices are low. Water issues are a concern. Its been a tough year.\", The value of U.S. milk industry was more than $30 billion last year, with exports growing to about 17% of that volume, said Jaime Castaneda, senior vice president of the National Milk Producers Federation. In Hawaii last week to monitor the talks, Castaneda still thinks the dairy dispute can be settled by months end. \"As soon as Canada puts a serious offer on the table, other parts of the puzzle will fall into place,\" he said., At issue on automotive \"rules of origin\" is the local content of cars assembled in a country. Carmakers source parts from all over the world. So before cars assembled in Trans-Pacific Partnership countries can be shipped tariff-free to one another, the parties must agree on what percent of a cars value has to be made in that country for that vehicle to be considered having originated there., Under the North American Free Trade Agreement signed by the U.S., Canada and Mexico in 1993, the rules of origin called for at least 62.5% of a cars value to be made in a NAFTA country. Mexico, home to an increasing number of foreign car plants, wants at least that same percentage in the Pacific trade accord, but Japan is seeking a lower threshold as its automakers use parts and materials from Thailand and other Asian countries that are not part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, according to the Oriental Economist Report, which analyzes Japan and U.S.-Japan relations., \"Mexico was worried that this would lower demand for auto parts made there,\" the report said., Meanwhile, the U.S. faces pressure from virtually all sides on the patent length for \"biologic,\" or drugs derived from vaccines, hormones and other organic agents. Most of the Trans-Pacific Partnership countries provide five years or less to protect such data before other firms can make generic substitutes. But the U.S. has 12 years of protection, and officials have been pressing to apply that standard to the Pacific trade deal, at the behest of key lawmakers such as Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who heads the committee on trade issues., \"Hatch and others should understand its not going to be 12 years,\" said an official familiar with the trade talks. \"Theyre still thinking seven or eight, but our trading partners have said not beyond five.\", On the whole, these three sticking points, plus outstanding issues on sugar and mechanisms to resolve disputes, represent a relatively tiny part of a sweeping deal that involves hundreds of tariff items and 29 chapters that cover rules on labor, state-owned enterprises, e-commerce and other areas of commerce and investment. But how these matters are resolved could make the difference when the deal is reviewed by Congress, which approved fast-track trade authority by only a small margin., Under fast-track legislation, the president first has to notify Congress 90 days before signing a final trade agreement. So if negotiators complete the trade deal at the end of August, the public would see the text of the agreement after 30 days and Obama could sign it as early as the end of November. But before it could be submitted to Congress for a vote, the U.S. International Trade Commission must publish an economic impact assessment, and the agency has up to 105 days to complete that report. Even if that assessment was expedited, with legislative rules and committee procedures  not to mention the Christmas holiday recess  its most likely that Congress wont vote on the trade pact until well into next year., \"Theres no magic about the political system,\" said Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks), noting that it doesnt really matter when the trade agreement comes before Congress. \"Theres politics in Washington 24/7, in presidential and non-presidential years.\" But, said the congressman, who is opposed to the deal, \"the details are going to be very important to members close to an industry thats affected, whether dairy, sugar or pharmaceuticals. Given how close the [fast-track] vote was, everythings a big deal.\", don.lee@latimes.com, Twitter:@dleelatimes, ALSO:, Group seeks a legislative fix as California refinery profits surge, Disney earnings soar 11%, but changes in TV industry pose risks, MAC Cosmetics announces makeup line in honor of late singer Selena Quintanilla]", "Date": "20150806", "Title": "[Negotiators hope to wrap up Trans-Pacific Partnership talks this month]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-tpp-talks-20150806-story.html", "Author": "[Don Lee]"}
{"Content": "[[, After a lengthy debate, the Senate approved a contentious bill on Friday that would grant President Obama the power to speed up passage of trade deals, but a tougher battle is expected in the House., The 62-37 vote to give the president so-called fast-track authority is a big boost for his top economic priority, bringing him closer to his goal of forging an ambitious Pacific free-trade accord known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership., Todays bipartisan Senate vote is an important step toward ensuring the United States can negotiate and enforce strong, high-standards trade agreements, Obama said. I want to thank senators of both parties for sticking up for American workers by supporting smart trade and strong enforcement, and I encourage the House of Representatives to follow suit.\", The hard-fought legislation, which Senate Democrats initially blocked in an unusual rebuke of the president, now moves to the House where there appears to be considerably greater resistance from both Democratic leaders and some conservative Republicans., Many Democratic lawmakers face enormous pressure to vote against fast-track, from constituents in their districts, organized labor and a hodgepodge of consumer groups representing doctors, the environment and an open Internet, among others., The Republican leadership, while traditionally favoring free trade, has found itself in a rare position of cooperating with Obama, but some GOP members are still loath to give the president a greater hand on anything, let alone one that would help him seal Americas biggest-ever trade deal., The real game is in the House, said Bill Reinsch, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, which like other business associations is strongly behind fast-track and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Frankly, the bigger problem is how many Republicans were going to lose than how many Democrats we get., At this point, congressional insiders and analysts trying to handicap the House vote -- which could come as soon as early June -- say 17 Democrats have firmly come out in favor of fast-track. About 190 Republicans, meanwhile, are known to be backing it, but where the remaining 55 House Republicans stand on the issue isnt entirely clear. If all of the latter vote against fast-track and Obama doesnt win about a dozen more Democrats to his side, the president will fall short of the majority vote needed to succeed., Fast-track, more formally known as trade promotion authority, is seen as essential to concluding the TPP. The authority would allow the president to submit a negotiated pact knowing that Congress must vote it up or down with no amendments. The White House says trading partners have been reluctant to show their final hand when theres risk the deal could be changed by American lawmakers., The Pacific trade negotiations involve the U.S., Japan and 10 other nations that combined make up 40% of the world economy. Their purported aim is to craft a comprehensive package that would not only remove tariffs but also devise rules and standards on things like intellectual property and cross-border data flows., Obama has argued that expanding trade and investment opportunities in the Pacific Rim is crucial to American economic and geopolitical interests, especially in the face of a rising China. But many Democrats are concerned that freer trade will hurt U.S. industries and jobs, and some high-profile opponents such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have sharply criticized the Trans-Pacific Partnership for both the secrecy in which negotiations have been conducted and certain elements of the proposed pact that have been shared with lawmakers under strict confidentiality rules., Obamas fast-track victory in the Senate was practically assured after a bloc of pro-trade Democrats ended a one-day filibuster earlier this month after bipartisan leaders agreed to add expanded worker retraining assistance to the bill and take up separately a measure to punish nations that manipulate currency values to boost trade., The Senate earlier easily passed the currency manipulation bill, but experts agree it was largely a symbolic action as it has almost no chance of clearing the House., A separate currency measure, offered Friday as an amendment to the fast-track bill, brought a veto threat from the White House and prompted Obama to personally lobby senators against it. It was narrowly rejected., How quickly the House will act on the fast-track legislation depends on when the GOP leadership thinks it has enough votes for passage. With control of both chambers of Congress, Republican leaders will have little trouble moving things along speedily., Time is pressing on Obama. Assuming fast-track is approved in June, analysts say, negotiators could wrap up the Pacific trade deal in July. The fast-track legislation calls for the president to wait 90 days for people to review the agreement before he signs it. Then it could take another two to three months for U.S. trade officials to prepare an economic-impact assessment of the deal, pushing a vote on the trade agreement by Congress into late this year at the earliest., The longer it takes, the more it will bump up against the 2016 presidential campaign and election-year politics, when sensitive issues like trade can complicate legislation. So while getting fast-track through Congress may be the biggest hurdle for Obama in his bid to finish the trade pact, analysts say, a successful House vote doesnt necessarily mean a smooth path ahead., On Thursday, some last-minute drama nearly blocked the fast-track bill from advancing at all. A few lawmakers threatened to withhold their vote because of an unrelated dispute over the future of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which is in jeopardy of shutting down next month if Congress fails to reauthorize it., The bank helps major U.S. corporations finance their business overseas, but it has become derided by tea party Republicans as a form of corporate welfare., Republicans in the House have said that they would prefer to allow the bank to wind down, rather than continue it., But several lawmakers from both parties have businesses in their states that depend on the bank and have pressed for it to continue., After hurried negotiations on the Senate floor, a deal was reached to allow a separate vote on extending the banks authority, removing the final hurdle standing in the way of advancing the trade bill., , , , , 6:46p.m.: The story was updated with Obamas comment.]", "Date": "20150522", "Title": "[ Senate passes fast-track trade authority for Obama, but House fight looms]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-senate-fasttrack-tpp-vote-20150522-story.html", "Author": "[Don Lee, Lisa Mascaro]"}
{"Content": "[[, After a pre-booking gathering that doubled as a campaign-style rally, Texas Gov. Rick Perry strode into a criminal justice center in Austin on Tuesday to be booked on two felony counts that pose for him both legal and political peril., Before entering to be fingerprinted and photographed, Perry defiantly insisted that he would fight the charges against him with every fiber of my being., Im here today because I believe in the rule of law, he said in brief remarks punctuated by repeated applause from his supporters. Im here today because I did the right thing. Im going to enter this courthouse with my head held high knowing the actions I took were not only lawful and legal, but right., As he has repeatedly since his indictment by a grand jury on Friday, Perry cast his legal fight as a struggle larger than him and centered on any citizens constitutional rights., I will not allow this attack on our system of government to stand, the Republican governor said. Im going to fight this injustice with every fiber of my being, and we will prevail. We will prevail because were standing for the rule of law., At that, he offered a wave and walked inside for the official processing and a mug shot that will undoubtedly ricochet around the political world., The charges accuse Perry of abusing his power by targeting the states ethics watchdog with a veto of its $7.5-million state funding. The Office of Public Integrity, which investigates elected officials in Texas, is housed in the office of Travis County Dist. Atty. Rosemary Lehmberg, a Democrat who has clashed with Republicans., After she was arrested on drunk-driving charges last year in a videotaped confrontation with police, Perry threatened the units funding unless Lehmberg stepped down. He said he could not support continued funding for an office with statewide jurisdiction at a time when the person charged with ultimate responsibility for that unit has lost the publics confidence.\", Lehmberg refused to quit, and Perry followed through on his veto threat, prompting a government watchdog group to file a complaint accusing Perry of improper intimidation. That led to the grand jury action announced Friday., Critics of Perry note that at the time funding for Lehmbergs office was cut, the public corruption unit was investigating one of the governors pet projects, the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas. Question have surfaced regarding funding of the institute and money given to some of the governors close allies; a former institute official has been indicted for his handling of an $11-million state grant., Perry was charged with one count of abuse of official capacity, which carries a penalty of five to 99 years in prison, and one count of coercion of a public servant, which carries a punishment of two to 10 years in prison., But the additional danger comes to Perrys political future. The longest-serving governor in Texas history, he had announced he would not seek another term and would step down in early January after 14 years in office. He has spent months visiting key political states, including money-heavy California and early-voting Iowa, trying to resurrect a political image damaged in his disastrous 2012 campaign for president., Since the indictment, he has worked to rally Republicans around himself as a symbol of government overreach  and even some Democrats have suggested that the indictment was far-fetched., For political news and analysis, follow me on Twitter: @cathleendecker]", "Date": "20140819", "Title": "[Texas Gov.

{"Content": "[[, After a series of setbacks, abortion rights advocates claimed a small victory Tuesday after a federal appeals court blocked a law that would have closed the last remaining abortion clinic in Mississippi., The law required that all physicians associated with an abortion clinic have admitting privileges at a local hospital. The states last clinic, Jackson Womens Health Organization, had filed a suit challenging the law, in part because none of the seven hospitals in the Jackson area were willing to grant the physicians admitting privileges., Mississippi officials argued that women could go to neighboring states to obtain abortions, but the three-member panel of the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled, 2 to 1, that the state could not shift its constitutional duties to another state., The law imposes an undue burden on a womens right to choose an abortion, the court said., The decision is curious because the same appeals court, with a different panel of judges, let stand a similar law in Texas this year. Similar laws are also being litigated in Wisconsin and Alabama and are in place in Kansas, North Dakota and Tennessee. Comparable laws will go into effect later this year in Louisiana and Oklahoma., The difference, said Matthew Steffey, a professor at the Mississippi College School of Law, is that the Mississippi law would have closed the last remaining clinic, whereas the Texas law closed only some., If you go all the way back to the era of Roe vs. Wade, the problem was that abortions were available in some jurisdictions but not others, Steffey said. Roe nationalized the right of access to abortion, and the court, for very good reason, said a state cant export or transfer its constitutional duties to other states., The state can still appeal the decision, and Jan Schaefer, a spokeswoman for the Mississippi attorney general, said in an email that the state was reviewing the ruling and considering our options., Steffey said the law was likely to remain blocked., I think its essentially game over at this point, he said., The Mississippi law, passed in 2012, was one of a flurry of antiabortion laws pushed by conservative legislatures after the midterm election of 2010. Some required doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges in local hospitals, others banned abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, and others required clinics to give women an ultrasound and then describe the image to them before performing the procedure., Legislators said the bills were aimed at making abortion safer for women, although many also said they would prefer to eliminate abortion entirely if they could., If a woman is going to have an abortion, we want to make sure she receives proper healthcare, said Rep. Katrina Jackson, a Democrat, who sponsored Louisianas admitting-privileges bill. Its about continuity of care., Abortion rights advocates have fought many of the state laws in court, with varying degrees of success. In January, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from Arizona on a state law that barred abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, effectively blocking that law, but similar laws still stand., The Texas admitting-privileges law still stands, and a paper released last week found that the number of abortion facilities in the state had dropped to 22 from 41 and that the abortion rate had declined 13% in the year the law has been in place., The courts have been a bit of a mixed bag, and sometimes restrictions are struck down, sometimes theyre not, and its very hard to predict what will happen, said Elizabeth Nash, the state issues manager at the Guttmacher Institute, which advocates for reproductive rights., In an effort to get a more definitive ruling on the matter, Planned Parenthood has filed a petition asking the full bench of the 5th Circuit to reconsider the Texas case. Its petition would essentially ask all of the judges to rule on the law, rather than just the three-judge panel, which upheld it in March. Differing decisions could make the case proceed to the U.S. Supreme Court., Also Tuesday, the Massachusetts Legislature gave final approval to a bill designed to tighten security around abortion clinics in the state. The law, which would allow police to disperse anyone impeding access and keep them at least 25 feet from the clinics entrance for up to eight hours, comes a month after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a 2007 state law that prevented protesters from coming within 35 feet of the entrances. Gov. Deval Patrick has said he will act quickly to sign the bill into law., In the meantime, clinics like the Womens Health Care Center in New Orleans are struggling to gain admitting privileges at local hospitals, since the law in Louisiana still stands. On a recent weekday, Sylvia Cochran, the administrator of the clinic, one of two in the New Orleans area, sat in an office as protesters outside held graphic images of fetuses and shouted at women approaching the building., The admitting-privileges law is a game-changer, said Cochran, who has been working at the clinic since 1977. It goes into effect Sept. 1, and abortion rights advocates say it could close all clinics in the state except for two in Shreveport., Cochran spent recent months applying for malpractice insurance, which is necessary for gaining admitting privileges, to no avail so far. The state had previously prohibited doctors providing abortions from obtaining malpractice insurance, a law that was overturned by the courts in 2012. No hospital had granted her clinic admitting privileges yet., If the New Orleans and Baton Rouge clinics close, it will be a shorter drive for New Orleans women to visit the clinic in Jackson, across the state border, than it will be for them to visit the remaining clinics in their own state., , 6:27 p.m.: This story was updated throughout with new information and details., This story was originally posted at 11:52 a.m., , ]", "Date": "20140729", "Title": "[Court blocks Mississippi from closing state's last abortion clinic]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-mississippi-abortion-law-20140729-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, After admiring the glazed pig turning on the spit at the \"Defend Freedom\" pork roast, Rick Perry was striding toward the stage when a master carver in an apron chased after him., \"Im a Perry guy now,\" Ed Naile of Deerfield quickly told Perrys New Hampshire advisor before returning to his post at the spit. \"Ever since that indictment thing.\", A week after he was indicted by a Texas grand jury, rallied GOP voters to his defense, and celebrated his booking by going for an ice cream cone, the Texas governor made his first foray to New Hampshire to test its voters willingness to give him a second chance in 2016., When he ran for president in 2012, Granite State voters were not impressed by Perrys confident swagger or his campaign trail antics., He did not endear himself to voters with his assertion that Republicans who didnt support in-state tuition for the children of illegal immigrants didnt \"have a heart,\" or the odd New Hampshire speech when he hugged a bottle of maple syrup, or that infamous moment during a Republican primary debate when he could not name the third federal agency that he would cut. (\"Oops.\"), This weekend, Perry was looking to turn the page on all that. Ironically, his recent legal troubles, which he has described as a politically motivated sham, seem to have heightened peoples interest in his potential candidacy. At each stop, staffers with his new political action committee, RickPAC, handed out free T-shirts bearing his now-famous mug shot. Some voters immediately put them on., Perry was jovial and warm in his one-on-one interactions with voters, and seemed keen to show the crowds that he is a different kind of (potential) candidate this time. During his first stop at a business luncheon in Portsmouth  where he seemed almost stiff in his tie and suit  he told reporters he wasnt \"physically or mentally\" on top of his game in 2012., \"I learned some really, really good, humbling and frustrating lessons running for the presidency. One is that if youre going to do this, you shouldnt have major back surgery six weeks before you announce,\" Perry said. He added that he hadnt done the kind of spade work required of prospective presidential candidates here., \"You have to spend a lot of time in these states if youre going to do it,\" he said in Portsmouth. \"Generally theres a courtship that goes on. Theres a period of time that you need to spend with people. They need to know you. You need to know them. And I didnt do that.\", With six events in a little more than 24 hours, Perry aimed to impress on voters that he had learned his lesson. He reeled off statistics about New Hampshires tax code, chatted with voters about his tutorials at the Stanford-based Hoover Institution, and sat attentively through a lengthy Americans for Prosperity presentation on the states economic challenges before giving his own talk., He was prompt and in no rush to leave his events as he was questioned by voters about illegal immigration, the advance of Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq, and the police response to the unrest in Ferguson, Mo.: \"You cant just go run up and down the streets and create mayhem,\" Perry said of Ferguson. \"The other side of that is you dont crush a fly with a sledgehammer.\", Perry was repeatedly asked about his recent indictment on charges of abuse of power, which stemmed from his threat to veto $7.5 million in funding for a state anti-corruption unit housed in the office of Democratic Travis County Dist. Atty. Rosemary Lehmberg., Perry threatened to veto the money unless Lehmberg stepped down after she was arrested last year on drunk driving charges in an ugly, videotaped confrontation with police. She refused to, and Perry followed through on his veto threat, leading a government watchdog group to file a complaint against him alleging improper intimidation., During his New Hampshire visit, Perry cast the indictment as a form of political persecution., \"I refer to Travis County as the blueberry in the tomato soup,\" he told one audience, before repeating his stock line on the legal battle: \"Im going to fight this with every fiber of my being.\", Perry spoke at far greater length about the threat of Islamic State militants and illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border, accusing President Obama of being too timid in his response to both crises., Perry knitted the two topics together by asserting that Islamic State terrorists may have already entered the United States via its \"porous\" southern border. Pentagon officials said this week that there was no evidence for that, but Perry repeatedly said it was a possibility., Speaking near the family home of New Hampshire native James Foley, the U.S. photojournalist who was beheaded by the Islamic State on video, Perry said Foley was the personification of courage who had shown the world the evil of the militant group, formerly known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS., \"Theyre not going to stop until they reach our shores and kill as many Americans as possible,\" Perry said. \"The issue before us is on what terms we will confront this threat. We can deal with it now using American air power, American special forces to help [Kurdish] peshmerga forces and Iraqi forces annihilate this threat. Or we can wait until the cancer of ISIS metastasizes, grows stronger, and the only option we have left is to send ground forces to fight a fourth war in the Middle East.\", He then mocked Congress for going on a five-week vacation when the nations immigration system \"is broken.\", \"Im not waiting on Washington,\" Perry said, drawing applause and whistles of approval from the crowd as he noted that he had sent National Guard troops to the border. \"If Washington will not take action to secure the border, Texas will.\", Perrys effort to project strength and resolve on a range of issues went over well with Republican voters who were skeptical of him during the last election cycle., Kathy Holmes of Chichester said she voted for Herman Cain over Perry that time because she thought \"that swashbuckler voice was probably too much.\" But, she added, \"hes a man of action now.\", As she waited in line for roast pork and baked beans in Rochester after hearing Perry speak, Holmes was already imagining Perrys mug shot making a \"great campaign button,\" especially if printed with a slogan like \"Do whats right.\", \"Do whats right, and then get an ice cream cone,\" her friend Debi Meyers suggested., maeve.reston@latimes.com, Twitter: @MaeveReston]", "Date": "20140823", "Title": "[Rick Perry courts New Hampshire for possible 2016 presidential run]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-perry-new-hampshire-2016-20140824-story.html", "Author": "[Maeve Reston]"}

Chris Christie in an interview on CBSs \"Face the Nation.\"\"In New Jersey, we have early voting that are available to people.\", In a speech last week, Clinton castigatedChristie, former Govs. Jeb Bush of Florida and Rick Perry of Texas, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker for \"deliberately\" seeking to disenfranchise voters throughout the nation with laws that make it harder to cast ballots., Christie, who will decide this month if he will run for the GOP presidential nomination, vetoed a Democratic bill in 2013 that would have expanded in-person early voting in the state., Speaking on \"Face the Nation,\" Christie said he doesntwant to expand early voting and \"increase the opportunities for fraud.\", \"And maybe thats what Mrs. Clinton wants to do. I dont know. But the fact is that the folks in New Jersey have plenty of an opportunity to vote,\" he said., Perry, the longest-serving governor in Texas history who last week announced his second bid for the Republican nomination, dismissed Clintons comments as \"ridiculous.\", \"Its way outside the norm of ridiculous, if you want to know the truth of the matter, to call out the people of the state of Texas, because thats what she did,\" Perry said onCNNs\"State of the Union.\", In Texas, Perry signed into law a controversial GOP measure thatrequires the states estimated 14 million registered voters to show photo identification to cast a ballot. The law, which has faced several legal battles, was allowed to take effect last fall by the Supreme Court., Republican-led legislatures from North Carolina to Texas have in recent years passedmeasures, including voter-identification requirements and limits on early voting, which have been widely criticized by Democrats as moves to disenfranchise minority voters., Clinton, in her Houston speech, called forautomatic voter registration, which would register every American citizen at 18 -- similar to a recently passed state law in Oregon., Moreover, she called on the GOP-led Congress to reinstateakey provision of the Voting Rights Act that had required states with a historic pattern of restricting minorities from voting to get federal approval before making changes to election laws.

{"Content": "[[, After bolting to national prominence on a record of bringing public employee unions to heel and taming runaway pension costs like those that have challenged state governments across the country, Chris Christie hit a very large hurdle recently., A state court ruling last week caused the retirement policies Christie had battered through New Jerseys Legislature to unravel spectacularly, leaving the state with a massive deficit driven by pension costs that Christie had not, it turns out, gotten fully under control., The judge ruled that Christie had violated state law by not making almost $900 million in required payments to the state pension fund in order to balance last years budget, a move the governor had planned to repeat for the current fiscal year., Among Republican governors hoping to become president, Christie is not alone in having troubles back home., In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker also faces a big deficit, which he has tried to close by cuts to the budget of the state university system, long the states crown jewel. And Louisianas Bobby Jindal is struggling with the fact that the state has gone from a giant surplus to a giant deficit under his stewardship., In an election season in which voters have a sour view of Washington, governors have unquestioned political appeal. But the problems that the GOP trio have run into in the last few weeks are a reminder that being a chief executive comes with downsides too., When all is well, a governor can tout his record of decisive action. But right now, governors who marketed themselves as fiscal miracle workers are scrambling to avoid damage from dour headlines., Democrats, of course, are doing everything they can to highlight the budget troubles the Republicans face, particularly at a time when blue states like California  which GOP presidential contenders have long derided as financially reckless  are doing well., \"Its downright laughable for these governors to run a presidential campaign on fiscal responsibility,\" said Jared Leopold, spokesman for the Democratic Governors Assn., Each of the three tried out a somewhat different strategy in speeches this week to the Conservative Political Action Conference, the annual Washington gathering where GOP headliners pitch themselves to party activists., Christies approach  consistent with his persona  was defiance., \"The elite folks from the media who cover me everyday,\" he declared, \"when you do things like I have done in New Jersey to take on a lot of these special interests frontally that they support, they just want to kill you.\", \"I am still standing,\" Christie said. \"Here I am.\", Still standing, but wounded. Even before the states fiscal problems made headlines, Christies position in the presidential field had been on the decline., Conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham, who interviewed Christie onstage at CPAC, pointed out that in one recent poll of Republican voters, he did worse than Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who has become a favorite among conservatives but an extreme long shot for the partys nomination., \"The budget provides more ammunition to Republicans who dont like him in the first place,\" said Jack Pitney, professor of political science at Claremont McKenna College and a former Republican party official. \"Its a convenient place to hang their misgivings and animosities.\", There is no shortage of ammunition. New Jerseys credit rating has been downgraded eight times during Christies tenure. Polls show that voters at home have lost confidence in his financial management., The state, according to data compiled by the Pew Charitable Trusts, is one of the least financially secure in the country. Its rainy day fund is so small, it could keep government running for just three days., \"These candidates wont be courting voters until later, but these troubles are raising doubts with the money people and party activists they need to court now,\" said David Redlawsk, director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University in New Jersey. \"Potential supporters are not flocking to Christie the way they did in the last presidential election, when they were begging him to run.\", For Jindal, a budget crisis is creating even more unwanted baggage., \"Its one thing for a Republican governor to be controversial and unpopular in a Democratic state like New Jersey or Wisconsin, and quite another to have rock-bottom ratings in a deeply conservative state like Louisiana,\" said Larry Sabato, a professor of political science at University of Virginia. \"In that sense, Jindal is in a deeper hole.\", Analysts say the culprit in his case is not so much the governor as plunging oil prices, which deprive Louisiana of tax revenue it relies on to pay for schools, roads and other services. But such are the perils of being the states chief executive. When things go wrong, the governor gets blamed., Jindals strategy at CPAC was to change the subject. He did not talk about state budget issues, preferring to steer conversation toward radical Islamic terrorists, Obamacare, White House immigration policy and how federal education policy oppresses his son, a second-grader., He also took shots at the GOP leadership in Washington., \"It is time for our Republican leaders in Congress to grow a spine,\" he said., Walker, who has long profited politically by portraying himself as a target of liberal attacks, embraced the criticism he is facing at home as a mark of his courage. And the crowd embraced him., \"We are a state that has been taxed and taxed and taxed, and today I am proud to say after four years as governor weve reduced the burden on hardworking taxpayers by nearly $2 billion,\" he said. \"How many other governors can say that?\", Although budget cuts at the University of Wisconsin will be controversial at home, they may play well among Republican primary voters, many of whom see universities as hotbeds of liberalism., All three of the governors went over well at CPAC. How voters in Iowa, the first caucus state, and others on the primary trail will respond remains to be seen., \"Iowans hate debt,\" said Tim Albrecht, a GOP political consultant in Des Moines. \"These governors will need to spend a lot more time explaining to voters here why they are having these budget difficulties.\", evan.halper@latimes.com, Twitter: @evanhalper]", "Date": "20150228", "Title": "[Deficits at home are hurdle for GOP governors eyeing White House run]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-gop-governors-20150227-story.html", "Author": "[Evan Halper]"}
{"Content": "[[, After investing millions of dollars in data, analytics and their ground game in an attempt to avoid the bruising losses of the 2012 election cycle, Republicans faced a key test Tuesday: Could they match the Democrats vaunted turnout operation?, The answer Wednesday was mixed. The GOP made significant gains in getting its voters to turn in ballots early and got its most loyal voters to the polls in force on election day, trouncing Democrats in Senate contests across the country. But they shouldnt be popping the champagne for 2016s contests just yet., In an electorate that overwhelmingly favored Republicans, Democrats said they managed to boost the number of ballots cast over 2010 in key states like New Hampshire, North Carolina and Colorado. And there is little evidence that the GOP made major inroads among women, minorities and young voters, who will be key to winning the White House in 2016., The turnout picture in Tuesdays election was complex. Ballots were still being counted Wednesday and the final numbers will not be certified for some time, but the preliminary figures showed an uneven picture across the country. There was a huge variance among the states based on whether they had hotly contested statewide races., \"Were probably going to have the lowest-turnout election [nationally] since 1942. Its that bad. And that was in the midst of World War II when people couldnt vote because they were off at war,\" said Michael McDonald, a political science professor at the University of Florida who specializes in voter turnout., But in the competitive races, \"we actually had fairly robust turnout,\" he said. \"If we look at where the campaigns were spending money and trying to encourage their supporters to vote, we do see higher turnout in those states  and we also see that the Republicans have stepped up their ground game and it does seem to be having an effect.\", Early numbers, McDonald said, indicate that turnout was up over 2010 in some parts of the fiercely fought battlegrounds of Colorado, Alaska, Iowa and North Carolina, pointing to a strong effort by both parties., In Iowa, Republican Joni Ernst vanquished Democrat Bruce Braley, winning an open Senate seat by 8.5 percentage points. But in Johnson County, the states most Democratic county, Braley appears to have done as well as Obama did in 2012, McDonald noted., But Ernst ended up performing particularly well in many swing counties, helping tilt the state in her favor after two presidential cycles in which Obama won the Hawkeye State., In Georgia and Louisiana, Democratic Senate candidates Michelle Nunn and Mary L. Landrieu actually performed better than Obama in some of the redder, and more rural, counties. But Democrats did not get large enough independents and presidential-year voters (those who generally do not vote in midterm elections) to counteract GOP enthusiasm., \"The data shows us that in the most Republican areas, the Democratic candidates in Louisiana, Georgia and Kentucky were outperforming Obama,\" McDonald said. \"And it tells us something about why those campaigns were hesitant to bring Obama in.\", The outlier in the more robust turnout picture, McDonald said, was Virginia, where the Senate race between Democratic incumbent Mark R. Warner and Republican challenger Ed Gillespie was surprisingly close. There, in the absence of a nationally driven effort by either side, many Democrats stayed home., The more troubling picture for Republicans as they look ahead to the presidential race in 2016 is this: Although they won in what some are calling a red tsunami, the long-standing rules about midterm elections held true. They won largely because the voters who turn out tend to be more white and more conservative than those who turn out in presidential years., A Wednesday analysis of exit poll data by the Pew Research Center found that men and older Americans were central to the GOP gains, and that there was little evidence that the party made progress closing its deficits among women or young voters., Exit polls showed that men cast their ballots for Republicans by a 16-percentage-point margin and women favored Democrats by a 4-percentage-point margin, similar to margins in the 2010 midterm election. Republicans also held a 16-percentage-point lead over their Democratic opponents among voters who were 65 and older, who made up 22% of the 2014 electorate compared with just 16% in 2012., By contrast, voters younger than 30  who favor Democrats  handed in 13% of the ballots cast, compared with 12% in 2010. In 2012, they made up nearly 19% of the electorate., Turnout was abysmally low across the board in states such as California and Texas., Texas, historically a low turnout state, stayed true to form Tuesday as Democratic efforts to hasten the states shift from red to blue came up well short. Even with celebrity Democrat Wendy Davis topping the ticket and close to $40 million in her campaign bank account, fewer than 30% of eligible Texans cast ballots in the marquee race., maeve.reston@latimes.com]", "Date": "20141105", "Title": "[A look at voter turnout suggests 2016 won't be easy for Republicans]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-election-turnout-20141106-story.html", "Author": "[Maeve Reston]"}
{"Content": "[[, After launching his 2016 presidential campaign by declaring \"yesterday is over, Sen. Marco Rubio began filling in some of the policy details behind his lofty rhetoric in a round of media interviews., The 43-year-old brushed off comparisons to President Obama, another young senator who after just a few years in office rode voters desire for inspirational change into a bid for the White House., \"I wasnt a legislative backbencher,\" Rubio told Fox News Sean Hannity, citing his nearly decade in the Florida statehouse and first term in the Senate., \"Im a free enterprise, limited government conservative, he said. Im a strong America conservative. Im an exceptional America conservative. I believe that the government has a role to play, but its a limited one. The familys more important. The private sectors more important.\", Among other things, he said he wants to reverse Obamas move to reestablish ties with Cuba, allow businesses to refuse gay wedding services and tax some wealthier households to provide bigger child tax credits., So far, Rubio has mostly aimed his criticism at Democrats, namely front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton, rather than the robust field of Republican rivals he will confront in the primaries. But his attack against \"yesterday\" candidates also served as a not-so-tacit swipe at likely Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush., Obama, he continued, \"has been a failure because his ideas are bad. I dont care if he had been in the Senate for 50 years. If he had done what hes done now, he would have failed too. His ideas dont work.\", Rubio catapulted to the Senate as a tea party favorite in 2010, but has strayed from deficit hawks with his support for beefed-up military spending., His tax plan, unveiled earlier this year, was praised for lowering corporate rates and bringing the top individual tax bracket down to 35%, but panned by conservatives for pushing some households earning $75,000, or $150,000 for couples, into a higher tax bracket. , He told Hannity that Medicare would need to be changed if it is to remain solvent, a nod to a GOP plan that would give future seniors -- people now in their mid-50s and younger -- a lump sum to buy insurance or apply to Medicare., The one issue, though, where Rubio has played a leading role -- immigration reform -- continues to complicate his presidential ambitions., Rubio backed away from the overhaul bill he helped pass through the Senate, primarily because the 13-year citizenship pathway it offered was criticized by conservatives as \"amnesty\" for immigrants here illegally., \"I dont know about the others, but Ive done more immigration than Hillary Clinton ever did,\" Rubio said on NPRs Morning Edition. \"I mean, I helped pass an immigration bill in a Senate dominated by Democrats. And thats more than shes ever done. Shes given speeches on it, but shes never done anything on it.\", When pressed by Hannity during the Fox interview, Rubio signaled a willingness to shift away from his long-held position that the United States should not create a class of permanent residents who have legal status to work here, but no chance at citizenship., \"I know that there are people out there that say, no, they should only have the work permit for the rest of their lives. I dont think thats necessarily a good idea, but if thats the only way we can move forward on it, I would explore it,\" Rubio said., That position may win over conservatives who continue to view the U.S.-born son of Cuban immigrants with skepticism over his attempt to change immigration law. But it is likely to only further distance him from the Latino and minority voters that Rubio hopes to attract with his familys inspirational story of immigrant struggles and success., Rubio was headed back to Washington on Tuesday, but will hit the campaign trail later this week to the early primary state of New Hampshire., For the latest from Congress follow @LisaMascaro]", "Date": "20150414", "Title": "[After soaring rhetoric, Rubio begins to outline policy positions]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-rubio-policies-20150414-story.html", "Author": "[Lisa Mascaro]"}
{"Content": "[[, After Mitt Romney lost the 2012 presidential election, Republican Party Chairman Reince Priebus commissioned an autopsy to determine what had gone wrong. High on the list: a yawning gender gap. Romney won the votes of most men but lost among female voters by 11 percentage points; among single women, the margin was a daunting 36 points. \"Our candidates  need to use language that addresses concerns that are on womens minds in order to let them know we are fighting for them,\" the Republican National Committee recommended., So Priebus must not be terribly happy that the partys (temporary) front-runner, Donald Trump, said Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly had \"blood coming out of her wherever\" when she asked him tough questions in last weeks debate., Trumps boorishness, however, isnt the GOPs biggest obstacle on the way to gender parity., A good chunk of last weeks debate focused on abortion. In an attempt to appeal to social conservatives, several candidates steered right into what most voters will see as fringe territory., Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said he thinks abortion should be illegal even when a pregnancy results from rape or incest, although he said he would support legislation including those exceptions if that was the only way to reduce abortions., Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker reaffirmed his view that abortion should be illegal with no exceptions, not even to save a mothers life. \"There are many other alternatives that can also protect the life of that mother,\" he said., And former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said he favored legislation to confer constitutional rights on the unborn, an action that could undo the Roe vs. Wade decision., Polls have consistently found that no more than one-quarter of Americans think abortion should be illegal without any exceptions. A 2012 CNN poll, for example, found that 83% of voters believed that abortion should be legal in cases of rape or incest, including 76% of Republicans., The last three GOP presidential candidates  Romney, John McCain and George W. Bush  all campaigned on antiabortion platforms but agreed to those exceptions., If Rubio, Walker or Huckabee win the nomination  and all three are in the top tier in national polls  Democrats will seize on their hard-line positions to widen the gender gap., Indeed, Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton has already pounced on GOP antiabortion rhetoric., \"These women that I have fought for, worked for, stood up for  may lose the right to exercise a personal choice if certain Republicans were to be successful,\" Clinton said Monday. \"What Marco Rubio said has as much of an impact [as Trumps comments], and it is deeply troubling.\", In case you missed it, Clinton is running explicitly as a champion of women  a role she shied away from during her first presidential run in 2008., All this talk about abortion (not to mention menstruation) raises another problem for the GOP: Those arent the issues Republican strategists think can carry their candidate into the White House., \"This election, like most elections, is going to be about jobs and the economy,\" Republican pollster David Winston told me. \"If youre off talking about another topic, unless its really pressing, youre not focusing where you need to.\", Winston analyzed the Fox News debate and found that only five of the moderators 48 questions were about the economy  about 10%. \"Its the voters No. 1 concern, but it tied for fourth in the debate,\" he said, after questions about the candidates electability, foreign policy and social issues., Republican candidates have tried to discuss the economy  Jeb Bush has said hell aim for a 4% growth rate; Rubio has proposed a controversial tax reform  but theyve been drowned out by arguments over abortion, immigration and Trump., Clinton, meanwhile, has been able to focus her campaign on economic proposals, including financial reform and college loans., \"You can agree or disagree with what shes saying, but at least she can drive what the discourse is about,\" Winston said., The one consolation for Republicans is that Clinton hasnt been able to turn that advantage into a gain in the polls. As NBCs Chuck Todd has noted, so far this campaign has mostly been an unpopularity contest  on both sides., Six months before the first primary, theres still plenty of time for Trumps lead to evaporate and for other candidates to turn the debate toward the economy.

{"Content": "[[, After months of failed negotiations, Los Angeles city officials on Friday struck a tentative agreement with the union representing the citys police officers, sources close to the deal said., The agreement would grant raises in the last three years of a four-year contract, the sources said. In July 2016, officers would see a 4% pay increase, followed by 2% increases in 2017 and 2018. It would also increase officers healthcare subsidies., The full details of the proposed contract were not available Friday morning., While the deal brings L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti a step closer to ending a contentious stalemate with one of the citys influential public labor forces, it must still be ratified by a majority of the Los Angeles Police Departments roughly 9,900 rank-and-file officers, as well as the City Council., In a joint statement, Garcetti, Council President Herb Wesson and the police unions president, Craig Lally, called the agreement a fair and responsible contract that would enable the city to continue to recruit and retain the very best police officers.\", In the statement, Lally said the proposed contract includes a number of terms that reconcile the impasse and is a positive outcome for both the city and the officers who protect it., Union officials turned immediately to the next task of getting members to approve the deal., In a message to officers sent moments after the deal was struck, union leaders said: This has no doubt been a long time coming and we appreciate your patience as weve worked through this process. ... We are confident that if the terms agreed upon are ratified by our membership, it will boost internal morale and go a long way in the retention and recruitment of LAPD officers., Next Thursday, the union will hold the first of four meetings at which officers can cast their ballots on whether to accept the deal., The proposed pay increases are modest by the standards of past public-safety contracts, but could be crucial to securing the support of the unions rank-and-file. Officers voted to reject a previous deal negotiators hammered out in July, in large part because it included no increases in pay except to a slice of officers who were working at a lower salary than others., Emboldened by their members stance, Police Protective League officials returned to the negotiating table insisting that any new offer include a pay hike., That position left little room to negotiate as Garcetti and other city officials said the city could not afford raises as it struggled to close a long-running budget deficit by 2018. A contract last year with the powerful union that represents city Department of Water and Power workers included no pay increases., Throughout the talks, league officials have argued that the mayor should treat police officers differently from other city workers when it came to raises. They drew attention to what they said were stark disparities in pay between LAPD officers and those working for smaller, often safer departments in the region., We want to be first, Officer Peter Repovich, who serves on the unions board, told City Council members in July, in arguing LAPD officers should be paid more than other officers. Were No. 1 and we deserve it., After trading proposals, counter-proposals, and some testy barbs, union officials in September declared contract talks had failed and called for an outside mediator to try to broker a deal., At the time, the two sides were far from a deal. League officials wanted raises over three years totaling 8%, while the city was offering a two-year deal with no pay increase until a 2% hike on the last day of the contract., Tyler Izen, then-league president, dismissed the citys proposal as insulting., Fridays handshake came after three days of mediation. If officers vote again to turn down the proposal, the two sides could opt to return to the negotiating table. Ultimately, the City Council can elect to impose a one-year deal on the union., Despite holding the purse strings, city officials had to contend with some disadvantages when negotiating., Since the start of July, when a three-year contract between the league and city expired, a clause in that agreement has allowed officers to once again be paid cash for overtime work. The return of overtime funds, which were all but eliminated from the LAPDs budget several years ago as part of the citys cost-cutting measures, can increase officers pay substantially, making it easier for them to dig in their heels in the contract dispute., And faced with a worrisome drop in the number of people applying to join the LAPD and heightened discontent among young officers, city officials opted to increase pay for new officers and several hundred others hired in recent years at a reduced salary., Under the proposed contract, the city will continue to pay overtime, which marks a significant change from previous years in which LAPD officers racked up hundreds of thousands of overtime hours, only to have payment postponed years into the future., Deferred overtime hours must be paid when an officer retires, typically at a much higher salary., Budget officials had grown increasingly concerned about the looming cost of the unpaid overtime, which has ballooned from around $27 million in 2007 to $122 million this year., City Administrative Officer Miguel Santana had called on the City Council to move away from its reliance on unpaid overtime, comparing the practice to spending on a credit card., A return to a pay-as-you-go approach would also be welcomed by LAPD brass, who have forced hundreds of officers to take time off each month in an effort to rein in the growth of unpaid overtime., For more news on the city and LAPD, follow@petejamisonand@joelrubin on Twitter., 11:26 a.m.: This article was updated to include a joint statement by the L.A. mayor, City Council president and president of the police union, as well as quotes from the Police Protective League to its members., The first version of this article was published at 10:59 a.m.]", "Date": "20150306", "Title": "[L.A. reaches tentative contract agreement with police union]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-police-union-contract-20150306-story.html", "Author": "[Joel Rubin, Peter Jamison]"}
{"Content": "[[, After searching for months to find an attorney who would take their case, House Republicans made good on their threat to sue the Obama administration Friday, filing a lawsuit challenging the presidents authority to enact key parts of the Affordable Care Act., The case has been considered a long shot by legal scholars, as the Supreme Court has repeatedly rebuffed members of Congress suing on constitutional grounds., But if successful, the lawsuit could jeopardize billions of dollars in aid to help low-income Americans get medical care., It marks yet another attempt by critics to use the courts to pull apart the health law. A separate legal challenge that takes aim at other financial assistance for low- and middle-income insurance consumers is scheduled to be considered by the Supreme Court next year., Filed a day after the president announced executive actions to halt deportation of millions of immigrants living in the country illegally, the new suit also underscores rising tensions between Obama and congressional Republicans., \"Time after time, the president has chosen to ignore the will of the American people and rewrite federal law on his own without a vote of Congress,\" House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said Friday., Boehner is under pressure from the restless conservative wing of his party to take a more confrontational approach toward the president in the wake of the GOPs victories in midterm elections this month., The lawsuit, which targets the Health and Human Services and Treasury secretaries, focuses first on a controversial provision of the health law that requires large employers to provide health coverage to their employees or pay a penalty., The so-called employer mandate is designed to prevent businesses from dropping health benefits now that the government provides subsidies to help low- and moderate-income Americans buy coverage. The architects of the law worried companies would be tempted to stop offering coverage, shifting the cost to taxpayers., The mandate, which requires extensive reporting by businesses, is unpopular with employers and with congressional Republicans., The Obama administration has wrestled for years with implementing it, twice delaying enacting the mandate., Each time, administration officials said they were acting under authority that gives federal officials the power to phase in changes to tax law., House Republicans charge the administration exceeded its authority., The lawmakers also argue the administration did not have authority to fund a program that is supposed to help low-income Americans with co-pays and deductibles if they purchase health plans through the health law., The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the program will cost about $3 billion this year, paid to insurance companies to reimburse them for providing discounts to their low-income customers., Those payments have been made all year. But Congress never specifically appropriated money for the program., That violates the Constitution, according to the lawsuit. Congress \"has a necessary role  indeed the defining role  in our system over any expenditure of public funds,\" the suit says., The White House issued only a one-sentence response to the case. \"Instead of passing legislation to help expand the middle class and grow the economy, Speaker Boehner and House Republicans are spending hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars pursuing a lawsuit that is without any sound legal basis,\" said spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine., Democrats for months have charged that Republican plans to sue were purely political., House Republicans struggled to find attorneys to take the case. Several prominent law firms turned them down., This week, Jonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University Law School, announced that he would take the case, citing his longtime concerns about the rise of executive power., noam.levey@latimes.com]", "Date": "20141121", "Title": "[House Republicans sue Obama over Affordable Care Act enactment]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-obamacare-gop-lawsuit-20141122-story.html", "Author": "[Noam N.

{"Content": "[[, After six weeks in session and 139 roll call votes in a House and Senate that feature some of the largest Republican majorities in generations, one of the most telling statistics from the new Congress is this: President Obamas veto threats outnumber the bills Congress has been able to send him., When Republicans swept into power last November, they promised a new era of productivity and discipline that would break four years of gridlock. \"Americas New Congress,\" they called it., But far from striking a bold contrast with the last two terms of stalemate, congressional Republicans have quickly run into familiar obstacles, including partisan paralysis and party infighting., Friday, as members of Congress rushed to leave town on a bitterly cold morning, Republicans celebrated their most visible accomplishment to date: sending the Keystone XL pipeline bill to Obamas desk for his expected veto., \"To the president I would say this: Do the right thing, sign this bill and help us create more jobs,\" House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio said in brief remarks before affixing his signature to the legislation., But as members of Congress go home for their first extended break since Republicans took control Jan. 6, they have few other achievements., Only two bills have become law  one a leftover from last year that funds a terrorism insurance program important to real estate developers, the other a noncontroversial measure to address mental health problems among veterans., That compares with six new laws at this point in 2007, when Democrats came to power in both chambers for the final two years of President George W. Bushs tenure., The new Republican majority, said one lawmaker granted anonymity to speak openly about their work, is like the dog that caught the car  still figuring out what to do next. Rather than begin the year with an agreed-upon strategy or comprehensive agenda for the party in power, the 114th Congress opened last month with a loosely defined set of legislative priorities., Even the Keystone bill was passed only after an exhaustive process in the Senate. During the course of the debate, more amendments were discussed and dispensed with than in the entire previous year when Democrats were in charge., In the meantime, however, gas prices plummeted, leaving some analysts to question whether the pipeline project would still pencil out., \"Is it the most important piece of legislation facing the nation? No. But it is an opportunity for us to prove that were able to work with each other and govern, and it is a good test of whether or not the president is interested in doing that as well,\" said Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.). \"We have to learn how to crawl before we can walk, and walk before we can run.\", Theyll have to walk quickly. When lawmakers return to Washington in a little more than a week, theyll once again face something Republicans had hoped to leave behind them  the possibility of a partial government shutdown., The shutdown threat stems from a legislative trap Republicans set for themselves last December after Obama moved to shield up to 5 million people in the country illegally from the possibility of deportation. At the behest of conservatives eager to undo the new policy, lawmakers agreed not to fund the Department of Homeland Security, which handles immigration among other duties, past Feb. 27., Republican leaders struggled for most of the last six weeks to find a way forward before the Homeland Security money runs out. They initially hoped a few Senate Democrats who have qualms about Obamas immigration plans might join them on a bill that would fund the department and overturn the presidents executive action., But Democrats have remained united in blocking any such plan. Republicans, with 54 senators, would need six Democrats to break ranks to end a filibuster of the bill., The partys disarray about what to do next could be seen over the last several days as Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) exchanged barbs over who was to blame for the impasse., Some Republicans in the House suggested their Senate counterparts overturn the chambers filibuster rules to get the bill through., \"We understand what the math is. But they have procedural rules that they can change,\" said Rep. Raul R. Labrador (R-Idaho)., Senate Republicans, who had angrily objected when Democrats did away with the filibuster for confirming most nominations, immediately shot down as unworkable the idea of wiping out legislative filibusters as well., Internal Republican disagreements have flared along other traditional fault lines, such as abortion, derailing bills that the GOP leadership had hoped would notch some early victories., The House has passed dozens of bills in its six weeks, including a repeal of Obamacare as well as measures on taxes and abortion., House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) wrote to colleagues Friday. He trumpeted the \"unprecedented\" output and noted that many of the bills drew bipartisan support., \"Despite a few detours along the way, we should be proud of what weve accomplished,\" he wrote., Many of those bills, however, mirror measures that passed in the last Congress only to collect dust in the Democratic-controlled Senate. House Republicans have hoped that their proposals will do better with Republicans in the Senate majority for the first time in eight years., So far, however, McConnell has seemed more concerned with restoring a more freewheeling but slow-moving legislative grind than with delivering legislative victories., Even when Republicans have been able to stick to their shared priorities  approval of the Keystone legislation, for example  they are running into the power of the White House veto threat., But all along, Republicans have said they should be judged not by their debut, but by the next few months of grueling legislating., April, when the party plans to pass its annual budget blueprint, will be the crucial point, party leaders say. The budget, they say, will provide a repudiation of Obamas approach and a road map for their partys candidates in the 2016 presidential election., Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), the partys former budget guru and now head of the Houses powerful Ways and Means Committee, outlined an ambitious agenda Friday as part of Republicans plan to provide alternatives to Obamas approach on healthcare, tax policy and entitlement programs., When asked to assess the new Congress performance so far, the former vice presidential nominee suggested the outcome was incomplete., \"Weve got a lot more to come,\" Ryan said. \"I feel like were just hitting our stride.\", michael.memoli@latimes.com, lisa.mascaro@latimes.com, Twitter: @mikememoli, @lisamascaro, ALSO:, In Republican Congress, two divergent strategies at work, GOP congressional majority likely to change way it crunches numbers, House abortion bill switch reveals emerging clout of moderate Republicans, ]", "Date": "20150215", "Title": "[Republican majorities struggle to get Congress working]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-gop-congress-assessment-20150215-story.html", "Author": "[Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, After the Supreme Court handed down a landmark decision last month sanctioning same-sex marriage in all 50 states, a longtime friend and former staffer to Vice President Joe Biden sent a text message to congratulate him: Your legacy. 28 years ago, the aide wrote., The reference was to the titanic battle Biden had waged as a senator in 1987 to deny a Supreme Court appointment to Robert Bork, the conservative jurist whose defeat led to the high court appointment of Anthony M. Kennedy., On same-sex marriage and the courts, the stimulus and the economy, Iraq and foreign policy, Biden has been an integral but occasionally overlooked force throughout his career, particularly in the White House., ------------, FOR THE RECORD, Biden legacy: In the July 12 Section A, an article about Vice President Joe Biden incorrectly described an aspect of the debate over Robert Borks nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1987. The article described Borks nomination as posing a threat to civil rights and abortion rights. The article should have made clear that this was the view of those opposed to Borks confirmation., ------------, Now, in what may be the closing chapter of his career, Bidens close circle of friends and former aides see the political landscape shifting toward him. And with an open presidential election looming, some wonder why he should surrender the spotlight., Hes the only person that would be in the race thats spent the last eight years helping make decisions from gay marriage to Obamacare to Iraq and Afghanistan, and understands how difficult it is, said Dick Harpootlian, former South Carolina Democratic Party chairman and one of the most vocal proponents of a third Biden presidential bid. This is the perfect environment for him., Whether Biden will embark on one last runfor the presidency is one of the remaining major questions of the opening stage of the 2016 campaign. The May 30 death of Bidens eldest son, Beau, has largely put the question on hold for Biden himself. His focus in recent weeks has been on his family, as was evident as he and his wife doted on their grandchildren during a trip to Vancouver this weekend for the womens World Cup final. A decision on whether to make a run is expected by September, though that timetable has already slid., The presence of an incumbent vice president who is not his partys expected nominee is an anomaly in most recent U.S. presidential elections. Yet those who might question why Biden would take on Hillary Rodham Clinton, widely seen as the heavy favorite in the Democratic contest, only need be reminded that he ran against her in 2008 under a similar circumstance. And as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders continues to show that some Democrats are open to a Clinton alternative, Biden might see a path to combine Sanders populist zeal with his own more establishment-friendly heft., On a number of issues that are likely to come to the forefront on the campaign trail, a close examination shows Biden had a significant role in shaping policy. The Supreme Courts historic ruling was one example., As the senator overseeing Borks confirmation hearing in 1987, Biden opted against an approach favored by many in the civil rights community: to focus on the threat Bork posed both to civil rights and to abortion rights. Instead, he opted for an examination of the nominees views on the right to privacy and the broader question of whether to recognize so-called unenumerated rights -- those not specified in the Constitution but upheld in court decisions., The fundamental rights notion  is the doctrinal basis for protecting gays and lesbians under the Constitution. Thats why what Biden did that summer was so important, said Mark Gitenstein, Bidens chief counsel at the Judiciary Committee at the time and the aide who sent him the recent text. What he did that summer was not only intellectually understand it. He articulated it in a way that average Americans could understand it and embrace it, too., Defeating President Reagans nomination of Bork ultimately brought about the confirmation of Kennedy, arguably the LGBT rights movements main judicial ally as the swing vote on the Supreme Court and the writer of the majority opinion legalizing same-sex marriage. Gitenstein also argues that Biden helped change the way Supreme Court nominees are considered, requiring them to address the question of fundamental rights that would shape jurisprudence on the Supreme Court for 30 years., Decades later, Biden had a more direct contribution to the same-sex marriage effort. In a 2012 television appearance, he plainly answered yes to the question of whether he supported the right of gays to marry, before President Obama had done so., Bidens affirmation, followed by the presidents, needs to be seen as one important powerful moment that absolutely gave permission to millions of Americans to rethink their decision and move in support of freedom to marry, said Evan Wolfson, himself a former Biden intern and founder and president of Freedom to Marry, a group Biden will speakto Thursday night at an event celebrating the court ruling., Bidens contributions to the fight for marriage equality grew out of the causes he championed in his earliest days in politics, which he has said were inspired by the civil rights movement of the 1960s., When you see him at his most passionate, its usually when hes addressing a situation where an institution or a person or a situation gives a more powerful person the ability to defeat the less powerful person, said Ted Kaufman, a longtime Biden confidant who briefly replaced him in the Senate when he became vice president. Kaufman cited the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, which Biden wrote, as a prime example., There was not much interest in doing this at the time when he presented it. But its had an incredible impact in terms of the lives of so many people, and attitudes, too, Kaufman said., If he were to run, a campaign focused on economic issues could be enticing to the vice president, who often evokes his working-class roots., Hes thought a lot about the extent to which the economy is reaching or is not reaching people in the middle class, said Jared Bernstein, Bidens chief economic advisor during the Obama administrations first term. Biden was talking about these issues very pointedly in the campaign in 2008. Now you have everyone from Bernie Sanders to Ted Cruz talking about that., Biden has done little publicly to tip his hand as hes resumed his public schedule in recent weeks, and during his trip to Vancouver last weekend for the Womens World Cup final, the death of his son was clearly still at the front of his mind. When asked during the final minutes of the match about whether hed played soccer as a child he quickly recalled watching Beau, a team captain, play as a child., In a largely overlooked speech in May, just a week before his son died, the vice president came as close as he has to laying out what could be the planks of a Biden campaign, cloaked in a defense of the Obama administrations record., The economic stimulus was really very unpopular -- even among some Democrats it was unpopular., Well, guess what? I executed it -- we executed it precisely, he said. What is the mantra of the Republican Party? Government spending is wasteful. We dont know how to do it. We do. And it worked., The administrations auto-industry rescue? I know I get blamed for being the guy who pushed that, he said. I was proud to push it., In fighting for the Affordable Care Act, we settled the fight that Ive been involved in since I was a 29-year-old kid running for Senate -- healthcare is now a right, not a privilege, Biden told the audience at a Center for American Progress event., Were now in a situation where we cant back up, he said. I get criticized for being too straightforward, but, damn it, we ought to stand up and say what we believe and stand by it., Whoever is running, Biden added, should also talk about ... what weve done., For more White House coverage, follow@mikememoli]", "Date": "20150709", "Title": "[Biden's quiet role in same-sex marriage ruling fuels speculation about 2016 run]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-biden-campaign-question-20150709-story.html", "Author": "[Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, After waiting in a line that snaked on through the rain, enduring a security check, then waiting more while jammed into an orchard outbuilding packed with people, Deborah Bellefeuille said she was happy to see Hillary Clinton  but would also be happy to see her leave., The idea of Clintons coming back again and again to have repeated personal contact with voters did not thrill her., Bellefeuille gazed at the collection of wary Secret Service agents, gruff security guards, ill-mannered reporters and over-caffeinatedcampaign aides milling about the scene., She doesnt need to be here on a weekly basis, she said. She would bring all this b.s. with her., We dont need you people here every day, she added., Campaigns for the 2016 presidential election are underway and more than a dozen Republicans and Democrats are vying for the nomination of their respective parties. They include senators, former governors and even a reality TV star. And even more candidates expected to enter the wide-open race this summer. Staff writer Kurtis Lee explains.   , Campaigns for the 2016 presidential election are underway and more than a dozen Republicans and Democrats are vying for the nomination of their respective parties. They include senators, former governors and even a reality TV star. And even more candidates expected to enter the wide-open race this summer. Staff writer Kurtis Lee explains.   , Clintons celebrity gives her instant access to the media, unparalleledability to raise money and near-universal name recognition. But as the scene here showed, it also undermines her ability to forge one-on-one connections with voters, perhaps to her detriment in early primary states, where voters have come to expect close and repeated contact., Not that Clintons campaign isnt trying. There is no Hill-A-Copter thundering above farms and villages as there was in Iowa in 2008. Events are arranged to look more like community meetings than Bon Jovi concerts. The campaign mantra is humility., But no matter what else she does, she cannot escape being Hillary Clinton, with all the spectacle that implies., Even Jeb Bush, hardly an unknown, can slip into New Hampshire without anything close to the fuss that surrounds Clinton., The day after her event here, Bush, the former governor of Florida, held a town hall in Derry, at which one New Hampshire voter reminded the candidate that they had met three times. Im almost starting to have an opinion about you, the voter joked., The event bore little resemblance to Clintons New Hampshire appearances. It was advertised ahead of time on the marquee of the historic opera house in which it was held, tickets were easy to come by, there were no long lines, no Secret Service guards directed attendees to empty their pockets. Bush himself, dressed in practical trousers and a rumpled shirt, was hard to distinguish from the voters., Nor did the Bush organizers take the kind of precautions the Clinton campaign often does to avoid uncomfortable moments. The first question came from a veteran demanding to know if this Republican wanting to be commander in chief had ever served his country in the armed forces. Bush said he hadnt., A forum Clinton had held the day before with voters in the town of Rochester, N.H., had been more notable for who was not allowed in. Media access was restricted to a small pool of journalists who would share their notes with other organizations. But the campaign had turned away that days designated pool reporter, a writer from the Daily Mail, a London tabloid., The fuss over the pool detracted from Clintons message of the day  on childcare  and gave the New Hampshire GOP an opening to pounce, accusing Clinton of a secretive campaign based on a clear sense of entitlement and arrogance., The jabs arent just coming from opponents. A Nashua Telegraph editorial last month declared one Clinton event to be the antithesis of what New Hampshire is about., All that may be taking a toll, helping to create an opening, at least in this state, for Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent socialist from neighboring Vermont, to approach within striking distance., The entourage, the Secret Service, and all that runs contrary to what New Hampshire voters expect, said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center in Boston. His latest survey of New Hampshire voters suggested that a 30- to 40-point lead Clinton had held over Sanders a couple of months ago had now shrunk to around 10 points. Another recent poll found much the same., There are many reasons for the narrowing. Sanders had not yet announced his run when the earlier polls were in the field, and much of his gain could be simply his consolidating the anti-Clinton vote at the expense of other rivals. But Paleologos believes the entourage factor undoubtedly has dampened Clintons popularity., People are saying they feel disconnected with her, she doesnt engage, she is running a poor campaign, he said. New Hampshire voters need to be courted often., At the Concord event, which was less restricted than the forum in Rochester, Doug Whitbeck, a resident of Mason, a town along the border with Massachusetts, expressed hope the day would provide a two-way interaction., We see Bernie all the time, Masons wife, Gwen, remarked., There was some. Clinton took no questions from the dais, but those who persevered were able to get a quick handshake as two Secret Service agents hovered. Some people had been at the event for three hours by then., Students of the New Hampshire primary say they have seen this before. In 2000, every step Vice President Al Gore took in New Hampshire seemed a major production, involving tedious advance planning and heavy handed security. His rival, former U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, exploited that., Bradley could just show up in a minivan with a couple of staffers and start going through a crowd, said Christopher Galdieri, a professor of political science at St. Anselm College in Manchester. Galdieri suspects that after the latest polls, Clinton operatives are trying to pivot., There are probably people in Clintonland talking right now about how they can make it seem like less of a chore to go see her., Campaign officials say their plan all along was to get the candidate in front of more voters. Its still early in campaign season, they stress, adding that they always anticipated the race would tighten. At the moment, much of their focus has been on getting Clinton into house parties and other small groups where she can meet the activists who are key to spreading her message and building the get-out-the-vote machine the campaign will need., She is going to be doing forums and town halls, said Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign communications director. She is going to be doing all of that., The impression of Clinton as trapped in her entourage is largely a creation of the media scrum that surrounds her, Palmieri added., She does walk down the street, Palmieri said.

{"Content": "[[, After weeks of determinedly avoiding the media altogether, Hillary Clinton was finally drawn into an exchange with journalists Tuesday, briefly answering questions about donations to her family foundation, her emails while secretary of State, the millions she earned giving speeches and the Iraq war., It was a rare unscripted five minutes for a campaign that leaves little to chance. It was not clear if the candidate intended to talk to reporters at all, but once drawn in, she sought to turn uncomfortable questions about her record and the controversies that continue to swirl around her and Bill Clinton to her advantage., Bill and I have been blessed, she said of the $25 million they earned over the last 17 months giving speeches to companies, many of which have business before the government. We are very grateful for the opportunities we have had., That income figure was disclosed last week, though Clintons team worked to bury it at the bottom of the news cycle, filing a required statement of financial interest with the Federal Elections Commission during the dinner hour Friday night. Clinton spoke about the fees publicly for the first time Tuesday, and she sought to use her personal windfall to emphasize an oft-repeated campaign talking point about the troubles of the middle class., We have never forgotten where we came from, never forgotten the kind of country that we want to see for our granddaughter, and that means we are going to fight to make sure that everybody has the same chances to live up to his or her own God-given potential, she said. Most Americans understand the deck is stacked for those at the top. I am running a campaign that has very clearly stated we want to reshuffle that deck., The candidate has been so averse to engaging directly with reporters that it had become a story in itself. An impatient Fox News reporter finally drew Clinton into a media gaggle Tuesday by disrupting her carefully planned round-table event with small-business owners at a bicycle shop, shouting from behind the rope line a request for her to please answer questions from journalists., The exchange lasted all of five minutes. Clinton took five questions before dashing off., I am so proud of the foundation and I am proud of the work it has done, Clinton said when asked about the controversial donations it has accepted. Of that money, she said: It goes to show people are very supportive of the life-saving and life-changing work it has done here at home and elsewhere., Then it was on to her vote while in the Senate to invade Iraq in 2003, a move that continues to haunt her with progressive Democrats. I made a mistake, Clinton said, once again repeating her mea culpa on that vote. What we now see is a very different, very dangerous situation. The U.S. is doing what it can, but ultimately this has to be a struggle for the Iraqi government and Iraqi people., Next question?, Clinton was asked about the latest potential headache for her campaign, involving emails from longtime friend and advisor Sidney Blumenthal, who appeared to be advising the former secretary of State on Libya while doing business with a firm seeking contracts in that country., I have many, many old friends, Clinton said with a smile and a laugh. I always think it is important when you get into politics that you have friends from before you got into politics and understand what is on their mind. Hes been a friend of mine for a long time. He sent me unsolicited emails, which I passed on in some instances., And about those other emails when Clinton was secretary of State, another reporter asked, why is the government taking so long to release them? On Tuesday, a federal judge rejected the departments request to take until January to review and release them, ordering it instead to release them in batches between now and then., Clinton said she is all for moving the process along., I want them out as soon as they can get out, she said., Leading up to the exchange with the media, some big-name Democrats had expressed bewilderment at Clintons strategy of media avoidance. Among them was David Axelrod, the former aide to President Obama, who warned Clinton had dodged the media so persistently for so long that she risked it becoming a big news event when she finally did engage. On Tuesday, he was proved right., Later on Tuesday, at a campaign stop at acafein the small town of Independence, Iowa, Clinton had one final comment -- about the media itself., Noting the cafeowners nervous look towardreporters followingClinton, the candidate joked, \"I get worried about all these people, too., Journalists were then escorted outside., Twitter: @evanhalper]", "Date": "20150519", "Title": "[Hillary Clinton, after avoiding media for weeks, finally takes questions]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-hillary-clinton-answers-questions-20150519-story.html", "Author": "[Evan Halper]"}
{"Content": "[[, After winning control of the Senate and boosting their numbers in the House last fall, Republicans devised a moniker for their dual majorities that could pass for a new C-SPAN reality show: \"Americas New Congress.\", Branding is one thing, but governing is another, as the party has discovered very quickly in the new year., And so Senate Republicans have joined their House counterparts for a rare joint retreat in this chocolate-producing outpost with the goal of smoothing internal differences that threaten to disrupt a strategy to counter President Obama in the next two years., That starts with the two most senior Republicans: House Speaker John A. Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who by personality and necessity are taking different approaches to bring their rank-and-file along on issues including immigration, the economy and healthcare., After the first full week of Republican control of Congress, the diverging paths are clear: While the House quickly passed a tweak to the Affordable Care Act, approval of the Keystone XL pipeline and a confrontational Homeland Security funding package that includes provisions to block Obamas immigration plan, McConnell was presenting an experiment in \"regular order\"  congressional speak for the slow grind of nudging a bill, in this case about Keystone, through often cumbersome procedural hurdles., Whether the frenetic House will have patience for the methodical Senate is one question. Whether conservatives will tolerate the consensus approach McConnell needs to overcome a Democratic filibuster in the Senate is another., What emerged Thursday was a commitment to approve a GOP budget in the first 100 days of the new Congress  an ambitious if unsurprising starting point, given that doing so is a legal requirement., \"At the end of the 100 days, Id like to have our budget done,\" said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield. \"Getting the budget done is the start of everything else.\", Republican leaders also mentioned other top to-do-list items. The Senate wants to finish its work on Keystone and begin considering an Iran sanctions package. The House, meanwhile, will proceed with a crush of deregulation bills., But trying to bring the budget into balance within 10 years remains on top., In 2014, Republicans campaigned as much against then-Majority Leader Harry Reid as they did against Obama, accusing the Nevada Democrat of almost single-handedly blocking Republican ideas from reaching the presidents desk., Expectations are now high that with McConnell in charge and a 54-seat Republican majority in the Senate, those obstacles will be lifted., But McConnell is warning his House colleagues that a simple change in leadership may not be enough., At one closed session Thursday with members of both the House and Senate, McConnell portrayed the challenge he faces in quantitative terms, explaining that reaching a filibuster-proof 60 votes in the Senate is almost like needing a supermajority in the House of 260 votes, rather than a simple majority of 218., \"We have a much easier, swifter process in the House, but in the Senate its much more difficult,\" Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said of the discussion. Asked whether his conservative House colleagues were receptive to McConnells explanations, Chaffetz answered, \"Of course not.\", \"Patience is not in our vocabulary. At least it shouldnt be,\" he said. \"The leadership is going to have to figure out how to balance that. But we should not slow down because the Senate cant keep up.\", At a rare joint news conference here with McConnell, Boehner downplayed any inter-cameral tension., \"The House is going to work its will. The Senate is going to work its will,\" he said. \"There are 535 of us on Capitol Hill and to try to get all of us to agree is not an easy job. The founders never envisioned it to be easy. And it certainly isnt.\", Reflecting the political imperative of getting Republican majorities on the same page, the Senate caucus joined the annual House retreat for the first time in 10 years., Over the course of three days, lawmakers heard a comedy routine from Jay Leno, an overview of world events from former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and interpretations of the political landscape from pollsters and political analysts., The most important sessions of the retreat were the talks among the members themselves. Late Thursday, the discussion turned to the most thorny political question facing the party: how to respond to the presidents recent actions shielding millions of immigrants from the threat of deportation., A House bill passed Wednesday would not only seek to prevent the new policy from taking effect, but also undo the 2012 deferred action program that spared \"Dreamers\" from deportation., Senate Republicans have indicated it will be a heavy lift to overcome the almost-certain filibuster from Democrats., Because the measure was attached to a must-pass funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security, the standoff could risk a departmental shutdown. McConnell offered no indication of what the next step would be if, as expected, the House version fails to get 60 votes in the Senate., \"No more drama associated with shutting down the  thats off the table. But as to how we proceed, I dont know,\" said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the Republican whip., More broadly, some Republicans are looking ahead to the 2016 election, emphasizing the need to put forward a Republican alternative on immigration., California Republican Rep. Jeff Denham said the House attack this week on Obamas immigration actions \"sends the wrong message\" about the partys ideas to reform the immigration system., \"The American people have given us a very small window to show some leadership, and this is one of those key issues weve got to show some leadership on,\" he said., But Republicans insisted that there were more areas that unite them than divide them, and were hoping to keep the focus there., McCarthy outlined a host of bills that the Democratic Senate had blocked last year that would be passed again one by one over the next few months., Though some have robust bipartisan support, Republicans also appear ready  and sometimes eager  to send Obama legislation that reflects the partys priorities and forces him to use his veto pen., Sen. Richard M. Burr (R-N.C.) said even if House legislation lags in the Senate, voters will be able to have a clear view of Republican priorities, establishing a contrast between the parties heading into the 2016 presidential election., Over time, Republicans believe, more Democrats in Congress may want to distance themselves from the White House and join the other side of the aisle on issues that are popular with voters, even if they go against the president, he predicted., \"Every day he becomes a more irrelevant piece of the Democratic Party,\" Burr said. \"Thats not our job to chase the White House. When you get both houses of Congress, you dont chase shiny objects.\", michael.memoli@latimes.com, lisa.mascaro@latimes.com]", "Date": "20150115", "Title": "[In Republican Congress, two divergent strategies at work]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-gop-retreat-20150116-story.html", "Author": "[Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, After years of raging against President Obama, unhappy conservatives have a new target for their anger and disgust: the Republicans in Congress., The GOP seized control of the House in 2010 and four years later took the Senate. Yet even with those majorities, Republican lawmakers have failed to achieve such conservative priorities as rolling back Obamacare, their derisive name for the national healthcare law, or cracking down harder on illegal immigration., The controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline is no closer to being built  indeed, it may soon be dead  tough antiabortion legislation has languished in the Senate, and a fiercely disputed nuclear deal with Iran seems virtually certain to take effect, despite near-unanimous opposition from Republicans in Congress., In short, as many see it, the promise of the 2010 tea party movement and its 2014 echo have been dashed on the marble steps of the Capitol., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, People feel betrayed, said Greg Mueller, a longtime conservative activist and campaign strategist. They feel like they keep working and fighting to elect Republicans to get us back to a limited government approach to life, and all they get is more spending, more taxes and people who are afraid to fight liberal Democrats., A big beneficiary of that frustration has been Donald Trump., One of the curiosities of the 2016 presidential campaign has been the way the blunt-spoken billionaire surged to the top of Republican polls despite his relatively short party residence and history of statements favoring higher taxes on the well-to-do, endorsing government-run healthcare, backing certain gun controls  at odds with so much of the partys prevailing orthodoxy., Trump has trimmed some of his positions and reversed others  he now opposes legal abortion, for instance  as he seeks the GOP nomination, a process he likens to Ronald Reagans evolution from New Deal Democrat to conservative icon (a comparison that glosses over the length and depth of Reagans conversion)., But Trumps appeal is not so much about issues as attitude., The reason for his success is simple, observers say: Trump is giving unsparing voice to the contempt many conservatives feel toward the political leadership in Washington, Democrat and Republican alike. The scorn runs so deep, it overrides whatever differences voters may have with Trump over his garish lifestyle, his patchwork philosophy or past stances on particular issues., They dont see any difference between Nancy Pelosi and John Boehner, or Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell, said Sal Russo, a longtime GOP strategist, referring to the Democratic and Republican leaders of the House and Senate., People are just sick and tired of politics as usual, where nothing ever changes, said Russo, who helped engineer the rise of the tea party protest movement. Anybody who helps them vent their frustration at the system is an appealing candidate., Its not just Trump., Collectively, the three candidates with zero experience in elective office  real estate magnate Trump, neurosurgeon Ben Carson and businesswoman Carly Fiorina  account for roughly half the support in surveys of Republican primary voters., The candidate who most embodies the GOP establishment, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, lags far behind, trailing both Trump and Carson, in third place or worse, depending on the poll. If anything, his dynastic name and inherited support from his father and brother, the past Presidents Bush, has worked to his detriment., Establishment Republicans keep asking us to elect them, said Mueller, who worked for past insurgent presidential hopefuls Patrick J. Buchanan and Steve Forbes and now advises a pro-Fiorina political action committee. The question is a big fat for what?, Mindful of that sneering sentiment, others in the GOP field are also assailing the partys leadership., NEWSLETTER:Get the days top headlines from Times Editor Davan Maharaj >>, Freshman Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas is essentially running as an outsider from within, excoriating the Washington cartel and even calling McConnell a liar during a July debate on the Senate floor. The attack, a serious breach of protocol, drew a stern rebuke from Cruzs Senate colleagues but was cheered by admirers, including conservative radio titan Rush Limbaugh., Finally, he said, Cruz vents the frustration that every Republican voter has felt with Congress since 2010., Cruz joined forces with Trump on Wednesday at a Capitol Hill rally opposing the nuclear deal with Iran., Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a onetime GOP front-runner who has fallen far back in the large pack as Trump continues to leadin polls, has adopted some of the real estate tycoons pointed anti-Washington rhetoric., Calling in to Glenn Becks radio program, Walker assailed McConnell and other party leaders for a lack of accomplishments and insufficient vigor attacking Obama., I hear it all the time, and I share that sentiment, Walker said. We were told if Republicans got the majority in the United States Senate, there would be a bill on the presidents desk to repeal Obamacare. It is August. Where is that bill? Where was that vote?, Republicans in the House have voted more than 50 times without success to eliminate all or part of the law, but McConnell has not found a way around Democrats ability to filibuster in the Senate., There is, of course, a huge distance between the facile statements of the campaign trail and the way government works., David Winston, a political advisor to the GOP leadership in Congress, noted that, dispiriting though it may be for Republicans, there is only so much they can achieve lacking a filibuster-proof Senate majority and a president of their own party., He offered a glass-half-full defense of the Republican majority  \"What would have happened if Pelosi had been speaker?\"  and suggested that at a certain point the GOPs many would-be presidents would have to stop pointing fingers and show the solutions they have ... and their endgame and the strategy for how those become law., Meantime, a recent Des Moines Register-Bloomberg Politics poll found 91% of Republicans surveyed in Iowa, the first state to vote in 2016, were either unsatisfied or mad as hell with the political status quo. (The figure was 82% among Democrats.), More specifically, three-quarters of likely GOP caucus-goers expressed frustration with the Republicans in charge of Congress., Thats not likely to change anytime soon., mark.barabak@latimes.com, Twitter:@markzbarabak, MORE POLITICS COVERAGE, Report finds reason to believe Rep.

{"Content": "[[, Afterthe 2012 presidential election, when the Republican Party lost Latino and minority voters by wide margins, the GOP decided it needed to do a better job attracting those groups., But despite several years of outreach, the effort has run into limitations., Congress, in particular, has stumbled as Republicans repeatedly voted against immigrant-friendly measures that many Latino and minority voters support., The effort hit another rough patch Thursday., House Republicans voted to block a measure that would have allowed the Pentagon to consider allowingyoung immigrants who are in the country illegally -- but were given temporary legal status under a program startedby President Obama-- to enlist in the military., The measure had already won bipartisan support in the House Armed Services Committee when several Republicans joined Democrats toadd it toabig defense spending package., Passage would have meanta sizable shift in Republican thinking on immigration-related matters., But the provision ran into trouble when the House Republican majority decried it as a back-door \"amnesty\" for immigrants here illegally. Most Republicans oppose Obamas immigration actions., Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) led the effort to strip the measure from the defense bill, arguing that every immigrant allowed to enlist would take away a military spot for a U.S. citizen or lawful immigrant., \"This Congress should support and represent Americans by voting to stop military service opportunities from being taken from struggling Americanfamiliesin order to give them to illegal aliens,\" Brooks said., The Armed Services Committee chairman, Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), said the measure distracted from the essential purpose of the defense bill., In the end, the House voted 221 to 202 to remove the measure., Democrats called the Republican effort \"xenophobic,\" \"extremist\" and \"un-American.\", \"This is yet another example of anti-immigrant attitude on the part of the House Republicans,\" said Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), the minority leader., \"The dreamers in this country are deeply patriotic,\" said Rep.

{"Content": "[[, Alarmed by the dismal voter turnout in this months Los Angeles city election, California lawmakers are considering a massive expansion of vote-by-mail balloting and legalizing pop-up polling stations at shopping malls to help increase the convenience and appeal of voting., Opening polling stations weeks early and allowing teenagers to vote in primaries if they turn 18 by the general election, strategies already being used in Colorado and Oregon respectively, also are being debated., Sen. Bob Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys) said he felt compelled to take action after California saw a record low turnout in the November 2014 state election. His commitment to change the system took on new urgency after only about 10% of eligible voters in Los Angeles participated in the March 3 municipal election., \"My heart sinks. Its just horrible. Its embarrassing,\" Hertzberg said. \"It just puts a lot less meaning on the democratic process. Weve got to do something to change the game.\", Hertzberg filed legislation to provide vote-by-mail ballots to all registered voters during elections, no longer requiring them to request one. Its among the nearly 20 bills that have been introduced to encourage greater turnout., State lawmakers began scrambling for answers after the November state election, in which a record low 42.2% of registered voters cast ballots. Among all those eligible to register, 30.9% voted., And then Los Angeles held its election., \"Here we were complaining about the 31% [statewide] turnout in November, and then just when we thought things couldnt get worse, it drops down\" to 10.3% for Los Angeles, said Sen. Benjamin Allen (D-Santa Monica). \"How sad.\", Experts believe some help will come for Los Angeles elections from a newly approved measure to align city votes with state and federal elections., But the state has been slow to respond to low voter turnout, said Kim Alexander, president of the non-profit California Voter Foundation, which advocates for the use of technology to promote the democratic process., A new computer system called VoteCal, which would allow voters to register at satellite polling stations on the same day they vote, was supposed to be operating in 2009 but has been delayed until 2017 by problems that include ballooning costs and the firing of the original contractor., In addition, the governor and Legislature have underfunded counties voter registration and vote-by-mail programs by up to $100 million, Alexander said., She said newly elected state officials, from Allen to Secretary of State Alex Padilla, appear to be bringing new energy and momentum to the issue., Many of the bills are likely to make it through the Democrat-controlled Legislature, but money could become an issue for some of the more expensive proposals., Padilla recently testified to lawmakers that the primary reasons people dont vote include apathy  such as the feeling that their vote wont make a difference  and a lack of knowledge that an election is being held. With people working long hours far from home, some dont find it convenient to get back to their neighborhoods in time to vote, Allen said., He has a bill that, once the VoteCal system is operating, would allow Californians to register to vote and cast ballots for two weeks before an election at satellite voting centers to be opened in schools, shopping centers, libraries and other public buildings., Allen, chairman of the Senate Elections and Redistricting Committee, said his panel is also looking at a proposal approved this month by the Oregon Legislature that would use drivers license data to automatically register all eligible people with licenses to vote., With 73% of eligible Californians currently registered to vote, a law such as Oregons could increase voter registration by 6.4 million people., Hertzbergs legislation, SB 163, would provide every registered voter with a mail-in ballot in the same envelope as their sample ballot so they would not have to go through the extra step of requesting a ballot., \"It takes down a barrier,\" Hertzberg said. \"Whether its poll taxes or literary tests or whether its your gender or your religion, weve always put up barriers, and its time to tear them all down.\", Counties where more voters participate by mail often have higher turnouts overall. Los Angeles County had the lowest turnout in the state in November and also the lowest percentage of votes by mail., The Hertzberg bill is modeled partly on the law in Colorado, where for the first time last year, all voters were given vote-by-mail ballots 22 days before the election and allowed to cast them by mail or in person during that three week period., Some 95% of voters in Colorados November election used their mail-in ballots, although some dropped them off in person, and the percentage of eligible voters who cast ballots increased to 54.5%, the third best in the country, said Tim Griesmer, a spokesman for the Colorado Secretary of States office., Assemblyman Kevin Mullin (D-South San Francisco) has proposed a constitutional amendment for the November 2016 ballot that would allow 17-year-olds to vote in a primary election if they are going to turn 18 by the general election., He noted that in the 2014 general election, turnout for eligible 18-year-olds was the lowest of all ages, at 5.2%., \"Most young peoples first contact with politics is in their mandatory high school civics class,\" Mullin said. \"This is the perfect time to get them involved and give them some ownership in the process by getting them to vote in primaries.\", The change would follow the lead of 20 other states, including Oregon, Connecticut, Hawaii, Indiana and Iowa, that allow 17-year-olds a chance to vote in primaries., Lawmakers are also looking at building on a pilot program approved for a few counties in which special elections could be held entirely with mail-in ballots., Turnout has also been a particularly difficult issue for special elections., When a special election was held Dec. 9 to fill a seat vacated by former Sen. Roderick Wright (D-Inglewood), only 7.2% of voters in the district cast ballots. Wright resigned after he was found guilty of lying about living in his district. Isadore Hall III won the 35th Senate District seat outright in the primary by garnering 17,951 votes in a district with 450,655 registered voters., Los Angeles County will spend $1.4 million to hold a special election on Tuesday for vacant state Senate seat in which the only candidate on the ballot is former Republican Sen. Sharon Runner. There are six write-in candidates, but Runner is likely to win the seat outright Tuesday., Allen said it was \"rather shocking\" that so much was being spent on what he called a \"coronation,\" when the county only allocates $250,000 for voter outreach programs., \"That says a lot about where our financial priorities are; we just dont invest enough,\" Allen said., Patrick.mcgreevy@latimes.com, Twitter: @mcgreevy99, Some of the bills aimed at increasing voter turnout that are being considered by the California Legislature:, ACA 2 is a constitutional amendment that would allow 17-year-olds to vote in a primary election if they will be 18 when the general election is held., AB 554 would allow high school students who are 16 or 17 years old to serve as poll workers with the aim of getting them excited about voting., SB 439 would allow Californians to register to vote and cast ballots for two weeks before an election at satellite voting centers to be opened in schools, shopping centers, libraries and other public buildings., SB 163 would require county elections officials to issue a vote-by-mail ballot to every registered voter in the county for statewide primary, special and general elections, no longer requiring voters to request the ballots., AB 1026 would require the secretary of state to meet with local registrars of voters, community groups and other people to develop strategies for improving Californias voter turnout and report recommendations to the Legislature., AB 1494 would tax campaign funds spent independently of candidates by special interest groups and use the money for programs to increase civic engagement, voter registration and turnout, among other things., SB 365 would allow elections officials to set up secure drop boxes throughout a community where people can leave vote-by-mail ballots., --Patrick McGreevy]", "Date": "20150314", "Title": "[ L.A.'s low voter numbers push state officials toward easing process]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-pol-election-turnout-20150315-story.html", "Author": "[Patrick McGreevy]"}
{"Content": "[[, Alaska Democratic Sen. Mark Begich trailed Republican challenger Dan Sullivan late Tuesday after a fierce campaign dominated by millions in spending by outside groups and Begichs determined efforts to distance himself from President Obama. But Begich insisted he would hang in for a week or more., With nearly 74% of the precincts reporting, Begich had 44.1% to Sullivans 50%., But Begich noted that he trailed on election night in 2008 too, and eventually defeated incumbent Ted Stevens when all the votes were counted., Weve seen this play before, Begich told supporters. Its gonna be a long night. It might be a long week. Ill take a win however it comes., Absentee ballots must be received by Nov. 14, and officials have until Nov. 19 to count them., The governors race was also likely to depend on the outstanding absentee ballots. Gov. Sean Parnell narrowly trailed, with 46.8% to challenger Bill Walkers 47.7%., Early in the race, Parnell was viewed as likely to win, but two developments ate away at his chances., After the primaries in late August, Parnell faced two opponents: Walker, a former Republican running this time as an Independent, and Democrat Byron Mallott. But Walker and Mallott realized they were both destined to lose a three-way race, so they joined forces. Not long after Labor Day, the Walker-Mallott unity ticket was unveiled., Parnell was also hurt by the daily drumbeat of bad press about a wide sexual abuse scandal in the Alaska National Guard, of which the governor is commander in chief., Allegations of sexual assault and official stonewalling in the Guard were first reported in the Anchorage Daily News a year ago, when a group of Guard chaplains disclosed that victims of sexual assault had been coming to them for years., Many of the women said they had been raped by fellow Guard members. Some said they had been drugged and assaulted. The chaplains said they reported the allegations to Parnell in 2010, but nothing resulted from their conversations., A scathing, 229-page report by the National Guard Bureau Office of Complex Investigations released in September found that complaints by some sexual assault victims before 2012 were not properly documented, that victims were not referred to victim advocates, that their confidentiality was breached and that, \"in some cases, the victims were ostracized by their leaders, peers and units.\", Parnell spent the last two months of the campaign defending his actions in the spreading scandal., In the Senate race, Sullivan, a former state attorney general, spent months attacking Begich as a tool of the Obama administration, a senator who voted with the president 97% of the time and who cast the deciding ballot in favor of the Affordable Care Act., For his part, Begich rarely uttered the presidents name unless prompted by a voter at a campaign event. But he told anyone who would listen that he voted with his Republican counterpart Sen. Lisa Murkowski 80% of the time., And about that deciding Obamacare vote?

{"Content": "[[, Alaska independent Bill Walker maintained a slim lead in the governors race over incumbent Republican Sean Parnell on Wednesday, while Democratic Sen.Mark Begichtrailed Republican challengerDan Sullivanafter a fierce campaign in which Begich sought to distance himself from PresidentObama., But with absentee ballots and some early ballots yet to be counted, both races remained too close to call., With 100% of the precincts reporting, Walker had 48% of the vote to Parnells 46.6% -- a 3,165-vote lead out of nearly 224,000 cast. Sullivan had 49% to Begichs 45.3%, and a lead of 8,149 votes., Absentee ballots must be received by Nov. 14, and officials have until Nov. 19 to count them., Begich noted Tuesday night that he had trailed on election night in 2008 too, but eventually defeated incumbentTed Stevenswhen all the votes were counted., Weve seen this play before, Begich told supporters. Its gonna be a long night. It might be a long week. Ill take a win however it comes., Walker, a former Republican running for governor as an independent, said his campaign would send observers to monitor election officials count of the absentee ballots and of the remaining early votes., In a statement Wednesday, Walker said he and his running mate, Democrat Byron Mallott, were \"humbled that so many Alaskans have put their trust in us.... We are invigorated by the optimism and dedication of so many Alaskans across party lines to move our state forward.\", Early in the race, Parnell was considered likely to win, but two developments ate away at his chances., After the primaries in late August, Parnell faced two opponents: Walker and Mallott. But the challengers realized they were destined to lose a three-way race, so they joined forces. Not long after Labor Day, the Walker-Mallott unity ticket was unveiled., Parnell was also hurt by the daily drumbeat of bad press about a wide sexual abuse scandal in the Alaska National Guard, of which the governor is commander in chief., Allegations of sexual assault and official stonewalling in the Guard were first reported in the Anchorage Daily News a year ago, when a group of Guard chaplains disclosed that victims of sexual assault had been coming to them for years., Many of the women said they had been raped by fellow Guard members. Some said they had been drugged and assaulted. The chaplains said they reported the allegations to Parnell in 2010, but nothing resulted from their conversations., A scathing, 229-page report by the National Guard Bureau Office of Complex Investigations released in September found that complaints by some sexual assault victims before 2012 were not properly documented, that victims were not referred to victim advocates, that their confidentiality was breached and that, \"in some cases, the victims were ostracized by their leaders, peers and units.\", Parnell spent the last two months of the campaign defending his actions in the spreading scandal., In theSenaterace, Sullivan, a former state attorney general, spent months attacking Begich as a tool of the Obama administration, a senator who voted with the president 97% of the time and who cast the deciding ballot in favor of the Affordable Care Act., For his part, Begich rarely uttered the presidents name unless prompted by a voter at a campaign event. But he told anyone who would listen that he voted with popular Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, his Republican counterpart, 80% of the time. (Finally, Murkowski sent him a cease-and-desist order after an ad presented the duo as a unified team.), About that deciding Obamacare vote?

{"Content": "[[, Almost exactly two months after Hillary Rodham Clintons announcement that shes running for president, she will give her first \"official campaign announcement speech,\" on June 13, according to her Twitter account., In other words, the Clinton campaign wants a do-over. Her initial rollout was the most disastrous nonfatal presidential campaign debut in modern memory., Her initial announcement video in April  which most outlets accurately reported as her official announcement  was well done. After that, everything went downhill; a steady stream of news stories and damning allegations about her family foundation and tenure as secretary of State has dogged her almost daily., Her best moment since announcing was when she was captured on grainy security video at an Ohio Chipotle franchise buying a burrito bowl. ABC News and MarketWatch dubbed it an \"adventure.\" Bloombergs Mark Halperin explained that Clintons excellent adventure was \"fun\" and \"new.\" \"Weve never seen her get a burrito before.\", Put \"Burrito day\" in the win column., In the \"loss\" column: plummeting poll numbers. In March she enjoyed a 15-percentage-point lead over Jeb Bush, according to a CNN poll. She had roughly similar double-digit leads over Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and Scott Walker., Those leads have nearly evaporated. Bush, whose rollout has also been less than stellar, now trails Clinton by 8 percentage points, according to CNN (but only 3, according to an ABC/Washington Post poll). Walker and Rubio are 3 percentage points behind her and Paul is 1, i.e. statistically tied., Worse, the public is souring on her, like a carton of milk left out in the sun. A majority of Americans polled by CNN now view her unfavorably (50% to 46%), her worst polling performance in 14 years. Fifty-seven percent believe she is untrustworthy, and fewer than half (47%) said she cares about people like them. In 2008, her image took a beating in her long and bruising primary fight with Barack Obama. Her image is worse today., The Clinton campaign has now conveniently embraced a strategy that says none of this matters very much., Jonathan Martin and Maggie Haberman report in the New York Times that the Clinton campaign has turned its back on a \"nationwide electoral strategy,\" opting instead to reassemble the Obama coalition of 2008 and 2012. To do that, Clinton needs to run to the left and pick polarizing fights that galvanize low-information and hard-to-motivate voters., The days of trying to win swing voters and independents are apparently over. Today its all about that base. \"The highest-premium voter in 92 was a voter who would vote for one party some and for another party some,\" James Carville, a longtime advisor to the Clintons, told the New York Times. \"Now the highest-premium voter is somebody with a high probability to vote for you and low probability to turn out. Thats the golden list. And thats a humongous change in basic strategic doctrine.\", Carvilles right that it is a big change in doctrine, but its unclear whether the doctrine is right. So far the entire theory rests on the precedent of one candidate: Obama. \"If she won,\" Martin and Haberman write, \"it would suggest that the so-called Obama coalition of young, nonwhite and female voters is transferable to another Democrat.\", As Ive been writing for a while, Im extremely dubious. Here are four reasons. First, Obama didnt really run as a polarizing figure in 2008. He ran as a post-partisan reformer who would end gridlock and fix the failures of the two-term incumbent (as did George W. Bush and Bill Clinton before him)., Second, Obama was a very good politician without much baggage (that the media were willing to report on). Clinton is a mediocre politician with mountainous baggage. Third, Obamas coalition has never been transferable to any other cause or politician, despite the presidents best efforts. And last, Clinton is running to stay the course., The Obama retreads around Clinton boast of their willingness to break with the practices of the past. But it looks more like they cant break out of their own Obama bubble., jgoldberg@latimescolumnists.com, Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinionandFacebook]", "Date": "20150609", "Title": "[Hillary Clinton needs a do-over ]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0609-goldberg-hillary-clinton-redo-20150609-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, Americans have a hard time taking their meds., Prescription drugs get more sophisticated, expensive and even confusing. People commonly forget how many pills to take or dont understand how to schedule them. Some leave pricey drugs to languish at the pharmacy. And its costing the healthcare system billions of dollars., David Julian takes 26 pills a day, most of which help to manage his epilepsy. Keeping track of them all has become a challenge., \"With the seizures come loss of memory, and the side effects of medications also affect memory. I had to start keeping a log of what medications I took and when,\" says the 46-year-old former operations manager from Villa Park., He has missed doses before, which has put him in serious medical danger., As a result, he has begun using a smartphone app called MediSafe. Its designed to help people manage and stick to their medications. The tool reminds him to take his medicine on time, which drugs need to be taken with food and how many times a day., Without the app, he says, it would be impossible to stick with his treatment., Ed Harvey faces a different challenge: a hefty price tag. The 77-year-old retired contractor from Malibu was prescribed a medication he says he needs to rebuild lost bone density., Hes covered by Medicare. Yet the brand-name drug his doctor prescribed, and for which there is no generic alternative, costs nearly $500 a month after Medicare has covered its part. And thats just one of eight different pills he takes., \"I spend about $1,000 per month\" on prescription medication, Harvey says., Patients like Julian and Harvey face many barriers to taking prescribed medications as directed, and it has become a huge problem. Some experts estimate it may cost the U.S. as much as $290 billion in excess healthcare expenses when people get sick because they dont adhere to their doctors instructions., \"We know that patients who have non-adherence to medications are more likely to be sicker and have more complications from their chronic conditions,\" says Dr. Gerardo Moreno, assistant professor at UCLAs Department of Family Medicine., About 50% of patients with a chronic disease, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, eventually stop taking medications intended to stave off major health problems, such as heart attacks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 25% of newly written prescriptions are never even filled., Experts say there are many ways to manage the problem, and they offer tips for doing so:, Manage high-cost prescriptions. A few simple steps may help reduce the burden. One is to work with your doctor to use medications covered by your health plan. Print out a copy of the list of covered drugs and bring it to your next doctors visit., \"If the physician understands the cost structure, he or she may work with the patient to find an alternative\" to expensive medications, says Dr. Robert Carr, president-elect American College of Preventive Medicine in Washington., Generally, generics are much less expensive than brand-name drugs. So if one isnt offered, ask if its available., And, if you cant afford your medicine, look for help. Harvey, the Malibu resident, for example, with the assistance of a care coordinator at UCLA, received a $3,000 grant from the pharmaceutical company that makes his medication., NeedyMeds.org has information on thousands of low-cost or sliding-scale clinics, drug manufacturer discount coupons, and co-pay programs that help people with insurance pay high out-of-pocket drug costs., In addition, pharmaceutical companies offer patient assistance programs for those who are uninsured. RXAssist.org has a database of pharmaceutical company programs that provide free medications to people who cant afford to buy them., Reduce multiple meds. Many people are managing one or more chronic illnesses that require complicated medication regimens. Work with your doctor to simplify your routine. Ask if medications can be put on the same cycle and whether combination pills are available., If you take a lot of medications, its also a good idea to ask your doctor or pharmacist for an annual evaluation. Some may no longer be needed., Put reminders in place. Keep a list of your medications with you, and consider using pill organizers, timers and dispensers. Also, new smartphone apps such as Medisafe that Julian uses can be helpful., In addition to reminding him to take his medications, the app lets Julian allow his caregiver to tap into his account to help him stay on track., \"Any patient that goes onto Medisafe can add what we call a Medfriend who can view a patients schedule,\" says Jon Michaeli, an executive vice president with Medisafe. Caregivers receive notice if the patient misses a dose., Talk about side effects. If you experience uncomfortable side effects, dont just stop taking your medicine. Tell your doctor. Often there are alternatives., Knowing what to expect before you start taking a drug can also help. \"Ask your doctor: What can I expect from this medication? What should I look for to indicate its affecting me in an adverse way and that I should notify you and your nursing staff,\" Carr suggests. \"The informed consumer is the best consumer.\", And make sure your doctor and pharmacist are aware of all the medications you take. This helps avoid negative drug interactions., Add convenience. A recent Kaiser Permanente study found that using mail order pharmacy benefits and increasing the medication supply to 90 days had a positive effect. The study found that people are more likely to take their medication correctly and on time if its immediately available to them., If youre not already using mail order, call your insurer to inquire. Most offer the service., For Julian of Villa Park, missing a dose of epilepsy medication can be extremely dangerous. Thats why hes so vigilant about staying on track. \"For someone like me this is essential.\", healthcare@latimes.com, Twitter: @lisazamosky, Zamosky is the author of \"Healthcare, Insurance, and You: The Savvy Consumers Guide.\"]", "Date": "20150503", "Title": "[How to stick to a prescription drug regimen]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-healthcare-watch-20150504-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, Among the familiar figures from Bill Clintons White House days now reemerging to help propel his wifes campaign, one stands out not for his record of trusted counsel or unyielding loyalty, but for salacious reporting on Clintons sex life that nearly undid his presidency., Although Hillary Rodham Clinton tries to run a highly disciplined campaign, the outsized role that David Brock plays is a reminder that this is, after all, still a Clinton operation, with all the psychodramas that implies. Brock is the once-ruthless right-wing reporter who nudged Paula Jones into public view with her accusations of sexual misconduct by the former president, who once suggested Hillary Clinton had an affair with a White House advisor who took his own life, who was a key architect of what she once dubbed the vast right-wing conspiracy to bring down the Clintons., Brock apologized long ago for his role as a Clinton attacker and dramatically shifted sides. Now, he is central to Clintons run for the White House as a linchpin of her shadow campaign., \"What kind of a movement would we be if we rejected converts? said Paul Begala, a veteran of the Clinton White House who now collaborates with Brock. He saw the permanent intellectual and ideological infrastructure they have on the right and brought it to the left., The man with the impressive shock of silver hair, unexcitable manner and odd personal history is prized by many veteran political operatives on the left for pushing the boundaries of modern campaigning. Hes also looked upon warily by the more methodical newcomers to Clintonland who could do without the drama Brock brings., Brock guides a network of pro-Clinton \"super PACs,\" mega-donors and opposition researchers that operates outside the confines of federal restrictions on campaign spending. At the center is Media Matters, his decade-old nonprofit group that meticulously monitors and counters conservative media, political attacks on liberal politicians and  more recently  unflattering stories about Clinton in the mainstream press., What David does that is so successful is show up the mainstream media for being lazy, said former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who leaned heavily on Brock for help when he became chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2005. He forces them to confront the facts that get omitted., Some backers of what is now a $28-million web of nonprofits controlled by Brock confess to uneasiness with the way he uses it to undermine mainstream journalists raising questions about Clinton. Brock has taken the lead in attacking the credibility of reporters who exposed the millions of dollars the Clinton Foundation collected from foreign donors while Clinton was secretary of State. An MSNBC anchor found Brocks insistence that the transactions were not newsworthy so exasperating that she finally asked him what planet he was living on., Brock turned down requests for an interview for this story, saying that plans to promote an upcoming book have him taking a break from such conversations until closer to its publication date., Brock made his way inside the orbit of the Clintons in the 1990s, amid his falling-out with the right. He had just published a highly anticipated biography of Hillary Clinton that conservatives hoped would destroy her career. Instead, the book offered a nuanced portrait of the then-first lady., Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal saw an opportunity to turn Brock into an informant as impeachment loomed, and the besieged White House was desperate to access the enemy playbook. A mutual friend in California helped bring together the two for lunch in Georgetown, and an alliance was formed. A book Blumenthal later wrote is full of details about how skilled Brock was at going undercover for the Clintons., Both men continue to reap dividends from the partnership., Brocks fidelity ultimately earned him entree into a coveted group of super-wealthy liberal donors that was organized by one of Blumenthals colleagues in the White House, Rob Stein. Steins group, called the Democracy Alliance, was looking to a build the type of network of think tanks and political organizations that the right had so successfully created during the Clinton years. Few were better positioned to help than Brock., There was some angst about how credible, how believable, how steadfast a progressive David could be, Stein said. It required a leap of faith., Brock outperformed everyones expectations. A seasoned Washington insider, he proved particularly adept at captivating donors, who were taken with his plans to put the machinery mastered by the right to work for the left. Stein calls him one of the best I have ever seen at raising money., One tactic he used was bringing donors face to face with a nemesis., He interviewed me in front of all his millionaire buddies, said anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist, one of the few figures on the right who still maintains a cordial relationship with Brock. We had a discussion about what I do, and what my thinking is.... It was a very smart way of educating his donors. He brought me in to show how tough and scary we are, that this is what he is up against., Brock leveraged his fundraising talent into an expanded empire. By 2011, he had reinvented the art of opposition research with a super PAC called American Bridge, which sought to track every utterance of every major GOP candidate. It did so much damage to Republicans in the 2012 elections that they eventually created their own carbon copy of the organization, America Rising., The empire continued to spread. Brock took over the board of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a prominent bipartisan watchdog group. He launched another nonprofit that exists to churn out a steady stream of lawsuits accusing Republicans of ethics and campaign finance violations. Then Brock announced that he was starting yet another liberal super PAC that pushes the boundaries of election law by coordinating directly with the Clinton campaign to respond to attacks against the candidate., As the network grew, so did Brocks indispensability to Clinton. Brocks abrupt resignation this year from the board of Priorities USA, the super PAC to which wealthy donors can channel unlimited contributions to the Clinton effort, set off panic among influential Democrats. Research from Brocks groups provides the foundation for the multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns created with Priorities cash. And key Priorities donors have long-standing personal ties with him., Priorities lured Brock back, but not before the dispute erupted publicly. Brock accused rivals in the group of orchestrating a hit job against him. His evidence was unflattering media reports about the eye-popping fees collected by a professional fundraiser he favors., No sooner did that controversy blow over than Brock surfaced in more Clinton-related drama. This one involves some $10,000 per month Brocks nonprofits have been paying Blumenthal, the man who welcomed him into the colorful world of Clinton loyalists two decades ago. Republicans on Capitol Hill are investigating whether Blumenthal and Brock did anything improper as they helped Clinton manage the political fallout from the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, while she was secretary of State., Brock seems to revel in the attention. He mocked the investigating committee in a lengthy blog post, which ended with an invitation to its GOP chair to come take a tour of his office., For more campaigncoverage, follow@evanhalper]", "Date": "20150707", "Title": "[David Brock, a Clinton enemy from the '90s, is now integral to Hillary's run]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-clinton-david-brock-20150707-story.html", "Author": "[Evan Halper]"}
{"Content": "[[, An unprecedented House lawsuit against President Obama that was once derided as a certain loser looks stronger now and may soon deliver an early legal round to Republican lawmakers complaining of executive branch overreach., A federal judge is expected to decide shortly whether to dismiss the suit, but thanks to an amended complaint and a recent Supreme Court ruling, the Republican-backed case has a much better chance of proceeding, attorneys agree., At issue is whether the House may sue in court to defend its constitutionally granted \"power of the purse\" if the president spends money that was not appropriated by Congress., The lawsuit alleges that Obamas top aides quietly claimed the power to spend $178 billion over the next decade to reimburse health insurers for covering the cost of co-payments for low-income people who buy subsidized insurance under the Affordable Care Act., The administration initially submitted a request for an annual appropriation  about $4 billion last year  but then changed course. Officials, including Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell, decided the so-called cost-sharing payments to insurers were mandatory and were akin to an entitlement written into law, so there was no need to seek additional approval from Congress., NEWSLETTER:Get the days top headlines from Times Editor Davan Maharaj >>, House Republicans disagree and say the administrations spending is unconstitutional., \"The power of the purse is the very thumping heart of the legislative function in our system of separation of powers,\" said Jonathan Turley, the George Washington University professor who was hired in November to lead the lawsuit., Even if a federal judge allows the complaint to proceed, the lawsuit still faces a series of hurdles. And regardless of who wins, the future of Obamas healthcare law does not appear to turn on the outcome. However, insurance premiums could rise sharply if the cost-sharing payments are cut off., In May, U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer voiced exasperation when a Justice Department lawyer tried to explain why the Obama administration was entitled to spend the money without the approval of Congress. Why is that \"not an insult to the Constitution?\" Collyer asked., But the more formidable barrier now facing the lawsuit is a procedural rule. Judges have repeatedly said lawmakers do not have standing to re-fight political battles in court., In an oft-cited ruling, the Supreme Court in 1997 tossed out a lawsuit by six members of Congress who contended the newly passed Line Item Veto Act was unconstitutional. Justices said the lawmakers were not sufficiently harmed by the law to merit bringing a lawsuit., But in late June, the high court gave the House lawsuit an apparent boost when it ruled the Arizona Legislature had standing to sue in federal court to defend its power to draw election districts. Although the Arizona lawmakers lost their case, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the Legislature could sue because it was an \"institutional plaintiff asserting an institutional injury.\", That is exactly what House Republicans claim in their lawsuit. They say they are defending their institutional authority to appropriate money., Ginsburg in a footnote said the court was not deciding \"the question of whether Congress has standing to bring a suit against the president.\" But administration supporters acknowledge the high courts opinion in the Arizona case increases the odds the suit will survive., When it was filed last summer, the lawsuit was largely dismissed as a feeble gesture unlikely to succeed. It originally accused the president of overstepping his power by delaying an implementation deadline spelled out in the Affordable Care Act., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, That put Republicans in the awkward position of faulting the Obama administration for moving too slowly to enforce provisions of a healthcare law that they were simultaneously trying to repeal., Turley helped focus the case on the appropriations dispute, and those who have followed it closely are not so confident it will go away soon., The case \"is certainly not a slam-dunk\" for the administration, said Simon Lazarus, a lawyer for the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center. \"Judge Collyer was annoyed with the governments argument, so there is at least a possibility of Turley prevailing on the motion to dismiss.\", But Lazarus remains confident the administration will win in the end., Washington attorney Walter Dellinger, a former Clinton administration lawyer, believes the courts will not finally rule on the House lawsuit. \"There has never been a lawsuit by a president against Congress or by Congress against the president over how to interpret a statute,\" he said., If the courts open the door to such claims, lawmakers in the future will opt to sue whenever they lose a political battle, Dellinger said. \"Youd see immediate litigation every time a law was passed,\" he said., Twitter: @DavidGSavage, ALSO:, Jeb Bushs embrace of Common Core is a campaign lightning rod, For Obama, golf is an escape, even when he brings along members of Congress, Donald Trump says the wall hell build on the border could bear his name]", "Date": "20150820", "Title": "[House lawsuit against Obama is turning into a real problem for the president]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-obama-lawsuit-20150820-story.html", "Author": "[David G.

{"Content": "[[, Antonio Villaraigosas announcement Tuesday that he would skip the contest for Barbara Boxers seat in the U.S. Senate leaves an opening for an array of less-known Californians to take on state Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, the only major candidate so far., The former Los Angeles mayor was uniquely positioned to enter the campaign with a broad foundation of support, most solidly among Latinos in Southern California., But after more than six weeks of private consultations with political leaders and campaign consultants, Villaraigosa, 62, bowed out of contention., \"I know that my heart and my family are here in California, not Washington, D.C.,\" Villaraigosa said in a written statement that hinted of his enduring ambition to run instead for governor in 2018., Sen. Barbara Boxers announcement that she will not seek reelection put an end to years of frustration on the part of a younger generation of California politicians who can now start elbowing their way upward in the states first wide-open U.S. Senate race since 1992., Californias strongly Democratic..., Sen. Barbara Boxers announcement that she will not seek reelection put an end to years of frustration on the part of a younger generation of California politicians who can now start elbowing their way upward in the states first wide-open U.S. Senate race since 1992., Californias strongly Democratic..., \"I have decided not to run for the U.S. Senate and instead continue my efforts to make California a better place to live, work and raise a family. We have come a long way, but our work is not done and neither am I.\", Harris, a fellow Democrat and former San Francisco district attorney, expects to dominate the Senate contest in the Bay Area, a major advantage in the June 2016 primary. She has been raising money for weeks. She also has a head start in lining up supporters, including law enforcement groups rallying behind the states top prosecutor., Villaraigosas exit could draw heightened interest in the race from other Southern California Democrats who are weighing whether to run. They include Reps. Loretta Sanchez of Garden Grove, Xavier Becerra of Los Angeles and Adam Schiff of Burbank., But all of them lack the public name recognition that Villaraigosa gained in more than two decades as a staple of news coverage in Californias largest media market., \"Any member of Congress is not particularly well-known statewide, so thats definitely a challenge,\" said Parke Skelton, a Democratic strategist who has worked for a number of potential Senate candidates., Much can occur, however, in the next 19 months. Boxers improbable victory in the 1992 Senate race is testament to the potential of relatively obscure House members to vault to the head of the field in a tough statewide contest., But its not cheap to run for Senate, and federal donation limits make it an arduous task to raise money., \"We operate in a completely different political world now, and the amount of money it takes to run and win in California is daunting,\" said Democratic campaign strategist Katie Merrill. \"I think thats one of the reasons that you havent seen more people jump into the race.\", Still, Harris was elected attorney general in 2010 by a razor-thin margin, and she has yet to be tested in the glaring media spotlight of a big-arena contest like that for U.S. Senate., The campaign carries little professional risk for Harris. If she loses, she can keep serving as attorney general until her term expires at the end of 2018., But members of Congress cannot seek reelection and run for another office at the same time, so any who run against Harris must give up their jobs at the end of their current terms., Of those known to be considering the Senate race, Schiff has the most money in the bank  more than $2.1 million., Sanchez and Becerra would each depend on a Latino base in Southern California to buttress their candidacies, as would former Army Secretary Louis Caldera, a onetime Los Angeles state assemblyman who is exploring a candidacy. Their big challenge would be to build support among other groups., \"Successful candidates are going to need to move far beyond their ethnic or geographic base in order to win,\" said Rose Kapolczynski, Boxers longtime campaign strategist., History suggests the potential election of Californias first Latino in the U.S. Senate could mobilize a disproportionately large share of Latino voters., Latino turnout typically lags that of other voter groups in California, but a rare exception was Villaraigosas 2005 election as mayor, according to Political Data Inc., a nonpartisan company that tracks voting patterns. Villaraigosa was the first Latino mayor of modern Los Angeles, an important dynamic in his campaign to unseat Mayor James K. Hahn., For Republicans, Villaraigosas exit will have little effect. The partys popularity in California has dropped so low that its prospects for capturing Boxers seat are minimal., Republicans pondering a bid include Assemblyman Rocky Chavez of Oceanside and former state party Chairman Tom Del Beccaro, who have formed exploratory committees. Former state Republican Chairman Duf Sundheim is also considering the race., For Villaraigosa, the Senate contest would have been his first tough campaign since he ousted Hahn. Win or lose, it would have put the former mayor back in the public spotlight after 19 months of keeping a low profile in the private sector., It also would have put an early end to his employment as a consultant for Banc of California, Herbalife Ltd. and other companies., When he left office, Villaraigosa said he wanted to run for governor in 2018  a timetable that would give him more time to build his personal savings after serving as a state assemblyman, city councilman and mayor., But Boxers announcement last month that she would not seek reelection provided an opening for a quicker return to public office, albeit as one of 100 senators in Washington., Villaraigosa, however, was put off by the rush to decide whether to run and wanted to stay close to his four grown children in California, said former state Assembly Speaker Fabian Nuez, a close friend of the former mayor., \"I think governor is more along the lines of what he wants to do,\" Nuez said., The competition could be fierce. Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a former San Francisco mayor, has already formed a committee to start raising money for the governors race., It appeared to be no accident that Villaraigosas statement Tuesday echoed the one that Newsom put out last month when he too declined to run for Senate by saying \"I know that my head and my heart, my young familys future\" remain in California., At the end of 2014, Newsom reported more than $3 million in campaign cash already on hand, as did another potential Democratic gubernatorial contender, state Treasurer John Chiang.

To that end, he has spent  well, wasted  $4.9 million of his own money, a sum that could certainly have been put to better use if he really cared about the welfare of Californians., Draper has proposed dividing California into six states: Jefferson (Redding, Eureka), North California (Sacramento, Marin County), Silicon Valley (San Jose, San Francisco), Central California (Fresno, Stockton, Bakersfield), West California (Los Angeles, Santa Barbara) and South California (Riverside, Anaheim, San Diego)., Why?, California needs a reboot, Draper writes on his website, SixCalifornias.com. Our public schools have gone from the top in the nation to 47th. We are ranked 50th out of 50 for the worst business climate in the United States . Our state needs a massive investment in infrastructure and a streamlined process to help grow and keep business., Yes, our schools are a mess. But breaking up the state would not help. It would put a terrible burden on children in poor counties. Right now, school funding is equalized because of a court-ordered formula that redirects revenue from richer areas to poorer ones. Do you foresee a world in which the rich of one state voluntarily redirect their tax revenue to the poor in another?, Yeah, reboot this., Contrary to right-wing myths about Californias unbearable business climate, the state is not losing jobs to more business-friendly states like Texas. California adds jobs at roughly the same pace as the nation as a whole, according to the Sacramento Business Journal. Between November 2011 and November 2012, the Journal wrote, the state lost 12,000 manufacturing jobs, a decline of 1%. But the state added 26,000 information technology jobs, a 6% gain, during the same period., If you watch the animated video on the Six Californias site, you will hear a pleasant-sounding lady offer vague bromides about how smaller states would bring government closer and make it more responsive. , California is too big, she says. Driving the state north to south takes 14 hours, she says, as if this is a bad thing. How can Draper, allegedly a native of the state, be so pitifully unaware that Californians take pride in the vast size of our state?, Anyway, calls to break California up are nothing new. They began in 1850, the year we achieved statehood, and have never stopped (or succeeded!)., As recently as last September, supervisors in Modoc and Siskiyou counties voted to support breaking away to form Jefferson. I would be tempted to let them go, as they are contiguous with Oregon and/or Nevada and dont bring much to the party. In addition to their bad attitude, Jeffersonians rank dead last in personal income tax, the states greatest source of revenue. , Nevertheless, their departure would have an adverse affect on our states lovely silhouette. It would create a weird little claw out of Del Norte, Humboldt and Trinity counties. For aesthetic reasons, if nothing else, they must stay., As for the actual nuts and bolts of a breakup, state Legislative Analyst Mac Taylors report on the proposal, available online, is enlightening. Taylor outlines a process that would require so much cooperation by local, state and federal politicians that its failure is a foregone conclusion., Among the highlights:, -- Congress would have to approve the plan, and the president would have to sign it into law. (Is it likely that Congress would give California 10 additional U.S. Senators? Three words: Har har har.), -- A board of 24 commissioners would be appointed by the Legislature and county boards of supervisors to oversee the breakup. The board would have two years to do its work. If it failed to resolve financial and property issues within that time, each new state would keep all state assets in its borders, and all of the states debts would be divided among the states., -- Counties not happy with their assigned states could appeal to be reassigned to other states, as long as they are contiguous., -- Disputes would be resolved in the courts. The analyst notes that disputes between Virginia and West Virginia  which declared independence from Virginia in 1861  lasted 50 years and included several lawsuits that went as far as the Supreme Court., What Drapers plan would really do, besides make him famous, is create winners and losers, rich states and poor states., Californias current per capita personal income is $46,477, 12th among the 50 states. But the proposed Silicon Valley would have a per capita personal income of about $63,000, making its residents the richest of them all. (And by all, I mean it would be the richest state in the country. Only the District of Columbia would surpass it, the place where our very best public servants toil at low wages for the betterment of the country  until they can cash out and become lobbyists. But I digress.), Our poorest state would be Central California with a per capita personal income of $33,510, which would also put it dead last in the country, $150 below Mississippi., The Draper plan would inflict decades of expensive litigation on a state that can ill afford a distraction whipped up by a venture capitalist with more money than good sense. (Draper makes Tom Perkins, who likened vandalism on Google buses in San Francisco to the Holocaust, look positively reasonable.), And it would create even more enmity and discord than usual: Who would own our far-flung public universities and state colleges? How would we handle the incredibly complex and divisive issue of water? What about the planned high-speed rail? How would we address unfunded liabilities of the states existing public employee retirement plan? And last but not least: What about prisons?, Some have speculated that Draper, who made news recently when he scooped up millions of dollars of Bitcoin seized from the Silk Road marketplace, is trying to vault himself to prominence for a political career. Or that hes trying to goose Republican voter registration in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans 43.1% to 28.4%., I have no idea what his true motivations are. But I do know this. No one who truly loves California, and appreciates its pull on the American imagination, would ever want to break it apart., Tim Draper. Dude.

{"Content": "[[, As a proposal over a major trade deal reached a critical point in the Senate last week, lawmakers reported a rare occurrence: last-minute calls from President Obama., His calls ultimately helped ensure that the pact, a key item of his agenda, remained on track., The landmark trade deal being negotiated among 12 Pacific Rim nations presents Obama with the most significant test of his clout on Capitol Hill since his push half a decade ago for what would become known as Obamacare., Standing in his way are not Republicans, who have an unusual partnership with Obama on trade, but the presidents fellow Democrats, who are concerned that the proposed pact would hurt the U.S. middle class., The Republican-led Senate ultimately approved the measure granting Obama authority to negotiate the deal, but a fiercer battle awaits him in the House, where Republicans also need the votes of at least some of the minority-party Democrats to pass the bill., The presidents attempt to get Democrats to back the trade deal has required a reboot of their relationship, which Democrats have complained ranges from strained to nonexistent. The White House said the president and other top members of the administration are trying to persuade Democrats to come around., Obama and key officials have focused on two key blocs of potential support  the moderate New Democrat Coalition and the Congressional Black Caucus  in an extended courtship thats included rare White House invitations and promises to help them respond to any political fallout in their reelection campaigns next year., Party leaders on Capitol Hill, even those likely to oppose the legislation, also have helped with the pitch, facilitating trade deal briefings for lawmakers by Cabinet officials and others., The case Obama makes to Democrats privately is similar to what the White House argues publicly, focused on the substance of what the president has called the most progressive trade deal in history. The compact would set the terms for international trade among the participating nations, potentially creating markets for U.S. products, particularly in Japan., When we talk about the opportunity that exists for creating jobs and expanding economic opportunity for middle-class families by opening up more overseas markets to U.S. goods and services  thats a message that resonates with Democrats, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said., By the accounts of those whove been on the receiving end, Obama is having some success., Ive known the president since he was a state senator. Ive never seen him this strong, this emphatic, said Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.), who attended an April gathering with about 30 Democrats at the White House., But at that 90-minute meeting in the Cabinet Room, the conversation turned to what has been another vexing issue for the party: healthcare reform. Democrats 2010 votes in support of the presidents healthcare overhaul were a main factor in driving them out of the House en masse that year, taking his party from a substantial majority in the chamber to their lowest total in nearly seven decades., The administration argued that, despite the political risks, the Pacific Rim trade pact would ultimately be a consequential achievement, as the healthcare law has proved to be., For many of us who came in just as the president came in, our first tough vote was the healthcare law, said Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.). There were parallels drawn [in the meeting] about why it mattered and what it meant for history. It was a tough vote then, but its proven to be very important to our country., Obama has warmed to the debate, according to staffers who are involved in the efforts to advance the trade measures., One aide said it reminded him of the healthcare debates, back before Republicans hardened in their refusal to even consider the presidents arguments. Obamas meetings with Democrats have run long, the aide said, mainly because the president likes the conversation., Its a difficult issue but the persuadable Democrats are coming to him open-minded and torn  willing to be moved by the best arguments, one senior administration official said, requesting anonymity to talk about the closed-door sessions. He loves this sort of debate., The White House then brings in Vice President Joe Biden to follow up with Democrats who got the hard sell from Obama. Biden, largely silent on the issue publicly, acts as something of a good cop by relating to lawmakers as a former senator himself on how difficult such votes can be., As the White House pushes Democrats to line up, the trade agreement  and the odd coalition backing it in the U.S.  hangs in the balance., What Republicans wanted to see on Capitol Hill was that the president was going to make a concerted effort to bring along many of these Democrats, said Kevin Madden, a GOP strategist engaged in the lobbying effort on the deal. As theyve seen him make it a priority, I think that has actually helped with some Republicans., Obama also has something to offer Democrats that he doesnt for Republicans: a commitment to support them politically if they face primary challenges next spring over their trade votes., Recent history, though, invites skepticism about whether Democrats will be receptive to the offer. Most of them took pains to shed the Obama brand in midterm elections after the healthcare law was passed in 2010 and again in 2014 after its implementation was bungled., And as labor groups threaten political retribution, it remains to be seen whether Democrats will accept Obamas help in 2016 in exchange for their vote now., The White House is reminding lawmakers of the presidents unmatched appeal to the broad segment of Democrats that helped carry him to victory in presidential election years, when voter turnout is larger., Its no accident that one of Obamas major public speeches on trade came in a summit of Organizing for America, his former campaign operation that has morphed into a group that builds support for his policies, where he referred to critics of the trade deal who say it could harm the middle class., They dont know what theyre talking about. I take that personally, he said. Some of these folks are friends of mine. I love them to death. But in the same way that when I was arguing for healthcare reform I asked people to look at the facts  somebody comes up with a slogan like death panel, doesnt mean its true.

{"Content": "[[, As Congress pursues its latest investigation of Hillary Rodham Clintons missing emails and the role they may have played in the security lapses in the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, not every Republican is delighted by the prospect of dragging her to Capitol Hill for a skewering., Some see danger., The Clintons have proved adept over the years at turning allegations of misdeeds in their favor. Voter uneasiness with their conduct has, in the past, yielded to voter distaste for the zealousness with which Republicans exploited it., There are still memories of President Clintons approval rating soaring above 64% within months of his impeachment by the House in December 1998. Voters punished Republicans in the midterm election a month before the impeachment vote., \"Republicans have to be cautious and not look too overeager, politically, on this one thing,\" said Katie Gage, a GOP strategist focused on messaging that candidates might use against Hillary Clinton as she runs for president., \"Trying to turn this into a political issue and putting it all at her feet will allow her an opportunity to seem like she is being bullied,\" Gage said of the Benghazi investigation., The Clinton team appears to be doing everything it can to get Republicans overheated., Last week, a request by the House Select Committee on Benghazi for an interview with Clinton in a closed-door hearing was cast by her aides as a setup, timed so Republicans could leak parts of her testimony in the heat of the 2016 election., Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta characterized news that the committee may not wrap up its work until next year  election year  as \"the latest example in a broad, concerted effort by Republicans and their allies to launch false attacks\" on Clinton., There have already been several government investigations into the 2012 attacks in Benghazi that killed U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The reports did not support allegations from some Republicans that mismanagement by Clinton precipitated the tragedy., But Republicans are focusing on Benghazi anew after Clinton acknowledged this year that she had conducted all of her government business on a personal email account while secretary of State, handpicking which messages to preserve for the public record. She erased other messages on the account, which was run from a server in her home., Those details are tempting to Republicans eager to embroil Clinton in a major scandal. And on the campaign trail, the situation is providing plenty of red meat for GOP contenders., But back in Washington, Republican lawmakers are being urged to keep their cool., Nobody wants to relive those days in the 1990s when a top Republican insisted that Clinton aide Vince Foster, whose death was ruled a suicide, was actually murdered. Then-Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.) suggested he disproved law enforcements finding that Foster shot himself in the head by launching his own forensics investigation, during which he shot a bullet into a melon., As Clintons email scandal emerged, Republican media strategist Rick Wilson cautioned Republicans not to blow it. \"Try for once to play the long game and help Hillary Clinton take on water,\" he wrote in Politico last month. \"They want you to jack the volume to 11.\", The chairman of the Benghazi committee, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), seems to be heeding the advice., \"I have made no presumption of right- or wrongdoing on anyones part with respect to the Benghazi terrorist attacks,\" he said Thursday., The remark came as he sent a detailed letter to Clintons attorney that calmly suggested it was not his committee, but Clinton herself and the Obama administration, that were dragging the process out., He accused them of refusing to turn over all the documents the committee was requesting. He said the hearing need not be behind closed doors., \"With her cooperation and that of the State Department and administration, Secretary Clinton could be done with the Benghazi committee before the Fourth of July,\" Gowdy said., He pointed out that the State Department initially failed to tell investigators that Clinton was routing her government email through a personal account and controlling which messages got preserved, suggesting that earlier investigations may have missed something as a result., Democrats quickly followed up with their own timelines, questioning Gowdys assurances that he was merely seeking to follow the facts wherever they led. They note his committees inquiry is on track to last longer than the investigations into President Kennedys assassination, Watergate and the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001., \"The Republicans multiyear search for evidence to back up their Benghazi conspiracy theories has turned up nothing,\" said Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the select committee., He called the effort an attempt \"to drag out this taxpayer-funded search for anything they can use against Hillary Clinton, while their political arm raises campaign funds off the deaths of four Americans.\", evan.halper@latimes.com, Twitter:@evanhalper]", "Date": "20150426", "Title": "[GOP's latest Benghazi-related inquiry could benefit Hillary Clinton]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-clinton-benghazi-20150426-story.html", "Author": "[Evan Halper]"}
{"Content": "[[, As congressional Republicans find themselves tangled over their newly introduced spending plans, President Obama tried Wednesday to seize the moment to talk about government spending on his terms, namely a focus on opportunities for the middle class., Noting that Republican House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio often asks, \"Where are the jobs?,\" Obama told a crowd in Cleveland he was there to \"not only answer that question\" but also to renew a central debate over the two major parties economic visions., Obama said that his administrations policies, such as investing in manufacturing and the landmark Affordable Care Act, have helped the nation emerge from a deep recession but that the Republican budget would \"double down\" on the theory that wealth trickles down from the rich to the rest., \"Reality has rendered its judgment,\" Obama said in a speech to the City Club of Cleveland. \"Trickle-down economics doesnt work and middle-class economics does,\" he said, using the White Houses umbrella term for its fiscal policies., Meanwhile, Republicans who have the majority in both chambers of Congress are bogged down in trying to make their budgets workable as well as palatable to the partys competing factions., More than two months into the new Congress, they are grasping for legislative victories and looking to the House and Senate budgets unveiled this week as chances for a win in Washington. The chambers are expected to approve the budgets next week., \"Hopefully that will be an opportunity for us to show some success,\" said GOP Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee., Republicans are trying to present a unified front in their budget proposals, as internal debates have spilled out publicly between defense hawks, who want to bolster military coffers, and deficit-minded conservatives, who prefer to hold the line on new spending., Although both of the partys budgets largely boost military spending at the expense of domestic social programs, House and Senate Republicans are at odds over how to accomplish that goal while still adhering to strict budget caps agreed to in a 2011 deal with the White House., Senate Republicans made clear Wednesday that they view the House approach as essentially a gimmick. It calls for hiking defense spending by increasing money for an account used for wars that was not subject to the so-called sequester limits established in the 2011 deal. Senate Republicans prefer establishing a separate, new defense account funded with unspecified savings elsewhere, but it also would not be held to the 2011 caps., Either way, those cause \"real heartburn for conservatives\" because they maneuver around the limits, Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.) said., Those differences and others  including the Houses proposed Medicare overhaul that the Senate rejects  risk leaving the GOP unable to pass one budget., Such a setback would derail not only the goal of increasing Pentagon spending, but also other priorities, including the effort to repeal Obamas healthcare law., \"Im absolutely confident well do our duty,\" said Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, head of the Republican Senates campaign committee. \"Its one of the most important votes well have this year.\", The GOPs scramble to make the numbers add up with concrete legislative proposals while Obama spoke in broad, aspirational terms further illustrated the contrast between the White House and Republicans who control Congress., Obama no longer has to worry about being reelected, and since the November midterm election has made full use of the presidential bully pulpit to present his vision for the country without necessarily fretting over the short-term political consequences for him or his party., On Wednesday, he said he wanted to \"take a little credit\" for the nations economic recovery., Republicans have been loath to acknowledge any role Obamas policies might have had in the nations improved economic picture, with deficits on the wane and rising confidence among voters., \"Republicans are proud to take credit for helping force some fiscal responsibility on the Obama administration,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Wednesday as his partys Senate majority released its budget for the fiscal year that begins in October., The White House countered that the House GOP is trying to balance the budget in part by further slashing investments that would benefit the middle class., \"House Republicans start their deficit reduction plan by promising large, expensive new tax cuts to high-income households,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. \"In fact, the only specific tax proposals in the House Republican budget are tax proposals that benefit the wealthy.\", White House officials are eager to promote the notion that Obama has kept Republicans on their heels with a vigorous start to what he calls the \"fourth quarter\" of his term, a time when presidents often see their influence wane. Obama began the year with campaign-style trips in the run-up to a State of the Union address that challenged Congress new Republican majorities on a host of domestic issues., Democrats who shied away from the president before the midterm election now praise Obamas approach. Some, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is the Democrats ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee, have more leeway to push the party toward even more liberal policies., \"The president feels liberated,\" said Sen. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the assistant Democratic leader in the chamber. \"He doesnt have to measure his actions against the impact on a campaign, and there are many things that he wants to say to the American people in the last two years of his presidency.\", michael.memoli@latimes.com, lisa.mascaro@latimes.com, Memoli reported from Cleveland and Mascaro from Washington.

{"Content": "[[, As conservatives redouble efforts to end Planned Parenthoods government funding, House Republicans on Wednesday fueled an already emotional and partisan debate by hearing testimony from two women who were born during botched abortions in the 1970s., If abortion is about womens rights, then what were mine? asked Gianna Jessen, who was left with cerebral palsy due to a lack of oxygen during her mothers attempt to terminate the pregnancy., Im here today to share a story not only to highlight the war of abortion taking place at Planned Parenthood, but to give a voice to other survivors like me, Melissa Ohden told the House Judiciary Committee. Both said they survived failed saline-infusion abortion attempts in the late 1970s., The hearing, which did not include representatives from Planned Parenthood, comes after the release of secretly recorded videos showing several Planned Parenthood officials speaking in a cavalier manner about recovering fetal tissue from abortions for use in medical research., The videos, produced by the the Center for Medical Progress, an Irvine-based antiabortion group, swiftly reignited the abortion debate in Washington.

There was no evidence of any wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood., Michigan Democratic Rep. John Conyers Jr., the committees ranking minority member, called the hearing one-sided. His Democratic colleague Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia described it as a show trial, while another, Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee, went further and labeled it the Benghazi of healthcare hearings., Conyers also criticized the Center for Medical Progress for not testifying at the hearing. Planned Parenthood was not invited to counter the allegations against it. There is no credible evidence that Planned Parenthood violated the law, he said., The only person who testified in support of Planned Parenthood, Priscilla Smith, director of the Program for the Study of Reproductive Justice at the Information Society Project at the Yale Law School, agreed., The Center for Medical Progresss videos have no evidentiary value, said Smith, who testified in a personal capacity and not on behalf of Yale., Republicans, however, said the videos dramatically highlight the immorality of abortions and Planned Parenthoods role in profiting from the procedures, though it relies more on donations than on government funding., Some members have questioned why our investigation is focused on the conduct of Planned Parenthood and not on the conduct of those who obtained the undercover footage, said committee chairman Rep. Robert W. Goodlatte (R-Va.), Part of the answer is that Planned Parenthood, unlike the undercover reporters, is granted huge amounts of federal funds, making it our business as members of Congress -- charged with controlling the federal purse strings -- to do what we can to ensure federal taxpayers are not contributing to the sorts of horrors reflected in the undercover videos., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, ALSO:, California Assembly approves right-to-die legislation; Senate OK is expected, Secure in Iran deal victory, White House is gently mocking its opponents, U.S. gasoline prices projected to hit $2.03 by December]", "Date": "20150909", "Title": "[Abortion 'survivors' criticize Planned Parenthood on Capitol Hill]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-planned-parenthood-hearing-abortion-20150909-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}

{"Content": "[[, As he searches for his fourth Defense secretary in six years, President Obama appears to be looking for a more forceful, articulate military leader to navigate the tough but limited wars that are likely to consume much of his final two years in office., Finding a candidate with deep Pentagon experience who can help set a coherent strategy and defend it to the public and Congress wont be easy., Only a day after the job came open, two leading prospects  former Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy and Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.)  took themselves out of the running to replace Chuck Hagel, whose departure Obama announced at the White House on Monday., That leaves Ashton Carter, who was deputy secretary of Defense from 2011 to 2013, as one of the few contenders with the qualifications Obama appears to be seeking., In his previous two nominees, Obama placed little priority on Defense Department experience, focusing on someone who could oversee the withdrawal of troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. Hagel was a retired Republican senator from Nebraska who was critical of the wars of the last decade, while Leon E. Panetta, who preceded him, had been director of the CIA and had little background in military affairs., Obama is now facing a different environment. With U.S. forces engaged in military operations in Iraq and Syria, and an incoming Republican majority in the Senate already questioning the administrations handling of the conflicts, he needs a Defense secretary who can explain the strategy to Congress and better direct the military, current and former officials say., \"The president clearly wants someone who can be more forceful and win a public debate defending his policies,\" said Lawrence J. Korb, a former assistant secretary of Defense whos currently a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. \"He wants someone who looks good on the Sunday talk shows.\", Flournoy, who has long been considered a contender for the post, said in a letter Tuesday to the board of the Center for a New American Security, the think tank she heads, that she asked Obama not to consider her for the post, citing \"family considerations,\" according to a person familiar with the matter who asked for anonymity to discuss the private communication., With Flournoy out of the running, a top White House staffer said that Obama was still considering \"a number of well-qualified candidates.\", White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest emphasized that Obama was not looking for someone to take the Pentagon in a new direction, but rather to carry out \"the strategy that the president has selected.\" A top priority is dealing with Islamic State militants who have seized control of large parts of Iraq and Syria, Earnest said., Carter, 60, a theoretical physicist and former Harvard University professor, spent years in the Pentagon through two administrations, rising to deputy Defense secretary before leaving last year., He is known as a bold thinker who understands the Pentagon well and would not likely run into trouble winning Senate confirmation. He was confirmed unanimously by the Senate for both the No. 2 and No. 3. Pentagon positions., When Carter resigned from the Pentagon in 2013, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) praised him lavishly. Now McCain is the incoming chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which will hold hearings on the next Pentagon nominee., \"On many issues relating to defense and national security, Ash and I have had our differences,\" McCain said at the time. \"Some have been profound. But Ash has always conducted himself in a manner that appreciated the valid concerns underlying opposing views.\", Obama could also look outside to a candidate like retiring Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who isnt as likely to challenge the administrations current policies and is well respected in Congress. Jeh Johnson, the current Homeland Security secretary and former general counsel for the Pentagon, is also said to be under consideration., Whoever is tapped for the job will need to be comfortable working closely with the presidents national security staff. Panetta and another former Defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, both complained in autobiographies about what they saw as White House micromanagement of the military., \"Whats most needed is a secretary who will challenge assumptions and ask tough questions about policies for issues like [Islamic State] and Afghanistan, and help avert group-think,\" said Stephen D. Biddle, a military expert with the nonpartisan Council on Foreign Relations. \"Im not sure thats what the White House wants, though.\", It can be hard to predict how a new Defense secretary will affect policy decisions in the administration. When former President George W. Bush chose Gates to head the Pentagon during the height of the Iraq war, it was widely assumed Gates would push quickly to scale down the U.S. troop presence in Iraq., Gates instead became a strong advocate for sending more troops to Iraq. After staying on under Obama, he backed the militarys request to send more troops to Afghanistan, persuading Obama to back the increase, a decision Obama later came to regret., Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, rebuffed questions at a news conference Tuesday about whether Hagel had been forced out because of policy disputes. Among other things, the White House was said to be impatient about the slow pace of prisoner transfers from the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay. In October, a rift emerged after Hagel penned a two-page memo  leaked to the press  criticizing the administrations approach to Syria., \"This was a mutual decision arrived at between the president and the secretary of Defense after a series of discussions that they had about the next two years,\" Kirby said, declining to say more about the discussions., Hagels departure is not a sign of coming changes to the U.S. strategy for fighting Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria, Kirby added., If Obama chooses Carter, he comes into office with far more recent Pentagon experience than Hagel had and close ties with senior military commanders., Carter, who has a doctorate from Oxford University, joined the Pentagon during President Clintons first term as assistant secretary of Defense for international security policy, an influential position following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Carter worked to ensure the Soviets nuclear weapon stockpile did not fall into foreign hands., Carter came back to the Pentagon in 2009, serving as chief weapons buyer overseeing projects like the $400-billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. He rose to deputy Defense secretary, but left for Harvard after being passed over for the top spot., Carter could prove to be more aggressive than the often self-effacing Hagel was in defending the administrations policies in public and at pushing back against White House attempts to keep tight limits on military operations., Inside the Pentagon, other choices include Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, who has been discussed as a candidate in the past. Robert O. Work, the current deputy Defense secretary, is also a contender., \"The White House has shown they want someone who is onboard with their current policies,\" said Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense analyst with the American Enterprise Institute. \"They might not know exactly who they want for the job at this point, but theyre just sure they dont want Chuck Hagel.\", william.hennigan@latimes.com, david.cloud@latimes.com, Christi Parsons and Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, As presidential hopefuls officially begin their campaigns, the two parties face each other with opposing coalitions clearly defined along lines of race, religion and culture., Nearly 90% of the Americans who identify or lean to the Republican party are white. In particular, white, evangelical Protestants, who make up just under one-fifth of the overall U.S. population, account for more than one-third of those who back the GOP., By contrast, the Democrats depend heavily on minorities, people without a religious affiliation and the most highly educated segment of the white population, particularly women with graduate or professional degrees., The contrasting portraits come fromextensive data about party preferences released Tuesday by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. The data, drawn from about25,000 interviews Pew conducted last year for its surveys, provides a detailed look at where the two parties stand as the presidential campaign begins to take shape., The share of Americans who openly identify with either of the two major parties has declined over the lastdecade as more Americans call themselves independents. Most of those self-described independents, however, lean toward one party or the other, and they have voting behavior that is almost as predictable as more open partisans., The contrasting nature of the two coalitions drives the issues on which each party focuses. The Republicans heavy dependence on evangelical Protestants, for example, helps explain why the partys lawmakers have backed what supporters call \"religious freedom\" legislation in many states and also why they have had so much difficulty navigating the fast-changing politics of that issue., The Democrats reliance on minorities lies behind severalof President Obamas policies, notably his push for an overhaul of the nations immigration laws in ways that would benefit many Latino and Asian-American families., Because its candidates have done poorly with minorities in a nation that has grown steadily less white, the GOP needs to keep winning a bigger majority of white voters to prevail in presidential elections. Republican strategists have split in the past couple of years on whether the strategy of depending on white turnout remains viable in presidential contests., Overall, the Democrats enjoy a 48%-39% advantage in the share of Americans who lean their way, but that edge shrinks to 48%-43% among registered voters, the Pew figures show., The Democratic advantage has been fairly consistent going back to 1992, a period during which the party has won the popular vote in 5out of 6presidential elections. But in elections that dont involve the White House, the voters whomDemocrats count on do not turn out as reliably as Republican backers, creating a major advantage for the GOP in off-year contests., While many of the demographic divisions between the two parties have been constant for years -- Democrats consistently do better with women than with men; Republicans do better with married people than unmarried -- the Pew data show two major recent shifts, one favoring each party., Democrats have greatly improved their standing among Americans with graduate or professional degrees, particularly women., In 1992, Americans with more than a college education divided their political loyalties equally between the two parties. But since the middle of the last decade, that group has become increasingly Democratic. They now favor the Democrats by 56%-36%., Combine the gender gap with educational differences and the contrast become huge. Women with education beyond college favor Democrats by about2-1, for example. By contrast, white men without a college degree favor Republicans by 54%-33%., The other major change has been the growing Republican advantage among white evangelicals, which has expanded steadily during Obamas presidency. They now back Republicans by 68%-22%., Although the two parties also have a generational divide -- with older Americans favoring the GOP and younger ones leaning heavily toward Democrats -- that difference has more to do with religion, ethnicity and race than age itself., The so-called Silent Generation, made ofAmericans born between 1929 and 1946, is the whitest of the countrys major age groups and favors the GOP by 47%-43%., By contrast, Millennials, who range in age from18to33, comprisethe most racially and ethnically diverse generation in the voting population. They favor Democrats 51%-35%, but mostly because more than 4 in 10of them are nonwhite. White members of the Millennial generation have political preferences much like their elders; nonwhites of their age favor Democrats 61%-23%., For more on politics and policy, follow@DavidLauter on Twitter.]", "Date": "20150407", "Title": "[Race and religion split electorate as campaigns begin]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-party-identification-20150407-story.html", "Author": "[David Lauter]"}
{"Content": "[[, As Rep. Janice Hahn weighs a run for the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors  where her late father held a seat for four decades  the San Pedro Democrat faces a rapidly changing district and potentially strong competition for one of the most powerful local elected jobs in the nation., An advisor to Hahn said Wednesday that she will make up her mind soon whether to stay in Congress  where her party is out of power  or try to succeed Supervisor Don Knabe, who must leave office next year due to term limits., If Hahn enters the race, she would be a top contender due to her name recognition, fundraising prowess and ties to portions of the 4th District, which stretches from the South Bay through Long Beach and into several communities in the southeastern portion of the county. But she would likely be challenged by fellow Democrats as well as Republicans for a rare opening on the county board., \"Janice certainly is the front-runner by virtue of name ID and overlap of representation,\" said lobbyist Harvey Englander. \"But theres pluses and minuses to being from the city of L.A. when youre running outside of the city of L.A.\", Knabes senior deputy Steve Napolitano, a former Manhattan Beach councilman, is running for the seat. Other potential candidates include Rep. Linda Sanchez, state Senate GOP leader Bob Huff and former Redondo Beach Mayor Mike Gin., \"Ive been approached by about 18 individuals interested in running. Its going to be a wide-open field,\" Knabe said, adding that Hahn \"would probably be in the top tier of candidates because of her name recognition alone.\", \"I think the winner will be a much more moderate candidate of some sort  not a hardcore Republican or Democrat,\" Knabe said., A moderate Republican himself, Knabe was elected in 1996. The districts demographics have changed considerably since then., \"Its following the trend of the rest of Southern California and the state, becoming more ethnic and more Democratic as time goes by,\" said Eric Hacopian, a Democratic political consultant., In late 2014, the county Registrar of Voters reported that the district was home to 483,877 registered Democrats and 280,051 registered Republicans. The election to replace Knabe will take place in 2016  a presidential year  when voter turnout tends to be younger and more diverse, which typically benefits Democrats., The county board is among the most powerful local elected bodies in the nation, overseeing services such as law enforcement, healthcare delivery and land development for 10 million people. The five-member board spends $26 billion a year in public money, often with little oversight, and has executive, legislative and quasi-judicial powers., Hahns father, Kenneth, served on the county board from 1952 to 1992. The cavernous downtown Los Angeles fortress where the panel meets is named after him., Kenneth Hahn was a gregarious politician who knew how to keep himself in the headlines, a skill his daughter learned at his knee. She frequently appears in prime spots for television and picture appearances., \"Stand in the middle of the picture, then they cant crop you out,\" she said to The Times in a 2013 interview, remembering one of her fathers most important rules., Hahn, 62, served on the Los Angeles City Council for a decade before being elected to Congress in 2011. A junior member of the minority party, she has struggled to enact major policy., She has focused much of her energy on protecting the Port of Los Angeles, co-founding a ports caucus in 2011. She also serves on the Houses transportation committee, giving her some influence over port issues and other local priorities, including funding for Metro expansion., If Hahn enters the race, that will set off a chain reaction for the future of her congressional seat.

{"Content": "[[, As Republicans gather this week for a three-day strategy session at a Pennsylvania resort, the struggle over immigration is once again vexing their efforts to forge a unified front against President Obama., A year ago, the same retreat triggered an immigration clash after House Speaker John A. Boehner nudged the party to tackle the issue, but rank-and-file members slapped down the effort as not aligned with their priorities and too divisive in an election year., Now, with Republicans in control of Congress for the first time in eight years, the debate is over how to respond to Obamas executive action shielding up to 5 million immigrants in the country illegally from deportation. Republicans agree the program should be stopped but differ sharply on tactics., Republican leaders have adopted a Hippocratic-oath-like approach toward confronting Obama: First, do no harm to the party., Concerned that extreme positions or overly aggressive strategies could backfire with voters, GOP leaders advocate a pragmatic approach, preferring separate legislation that curtails the administrations new immigration program and provides a clear Republican alternative., But conservative rank-and-file Republican lawmakers are revolting, criticizing leaders for being too timid. They have unveiled legislative measures that would not only block the presidents latest program but unwind other immigration policies. One Republican initiative seeks to roll back the presidents 2012 action that has deferred deportation for more than 500,000 so-called Dreamers, young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children., The conservatives effort, which goes further than the GOP leadership wanted or others expected, would be incorporated into a must-pass spending bill to renew funding for the Homeland Security Department, which otherwise runs out of money Feb. 28. That raises the specter of a departmental shutdown if a compromise cannot be reached., Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson all but pleaded with Congress not to go down that road as he announced stepped-up security measures after the Paris terrorist attacks., \"I urge the full Congress to pass this appropriation quickly, unburdened by any restrictions on our ability to pursue executive actions to fix our broken immigration system,\" Johnson said Monday. In an apparent reference to the Paris attacks, he said his department could not function \"in these times\" with uncertain, short-term funding. \"There are homeland security and border security priorities that must be funded without delay.\", Although the rest of the governments funding was renewed last year through September, Republicans  at the insistence of the conservative wing  agreed to only a short-term extension for the Homeland Security Department, which oversees immigration agencies., This is not the way Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wanted to start the year., Both have set their sights on showing voters that the Republican-led Congress can lead effectively, in contrast with the past two divided congressional sessions that lurched from crisis to crisis. They are eager to move past shutdown politics and present a viable alternative to the Democratic agenda, particularly as the focus turns to the 2016 presidential election., But their troops feel burned by what many say are hollow promises from Republican leaders to engage the administration in a fight on immigration and other issues., \"Republicans in all these districts hate amnesty and they dont like the president  it just puts all the hot buttons together,\" said Roy Beck, executive director of NumbersUSA, an organization that favors limits on immigration. The group has been flooding lawmakers offices with calls from its 2-million-strong membership, urging Congress to stop the presidents program., \"What you hear from Republican voters is that their Republican leaders are spineless, wimpy  especially now that they control Congress,\" Beck said. \"Will Congress stand up as an equal part of government or will it continue to allow the executive branch to rule? Really, this is the first test.\", As the 114th Congress convened last week, there was no shortage of proposals to gut Obamas executive actions on immigration. The result was a five-amendment package., One Republican amendment would prevent any funds from being used for the immigration plan, including the fees immigrants pay to apply. Another would similarly halt funds for the presidents 2012 program that allows Dreamers to apply for temporary permission to stay. Others are more symbolic measures of protest against policies that lead to the hiring of legal immigrants over U.S. citizens, or give preference to immigrants who are in the country illegally over those awaiting legal entry., Conservatives view Obamas immigration program as an abuse of executive authority. But administration officials defend the policy, saying the president had to act because Congress failed to do so., The House put together a package of immigration bills mostly from lawmakers in Alabama, South Carolina and Tennessee. Each is expected to be easily approved in votes this week and tacked onto the Homeland Security funding bill. Prospects in the Senate are uncertain., Even if Senate Republicans could overcome a likely Democratic filibuster of the measure, the White House has already threatened to veto the $39.7-billion Homeland Security bill if it is loaded up with \"objectionable restrictions\" to the presidents immigration action., Administration officials have warned that stable security funds are vital in the aftermath of the Paris attacks. They also say that without newly approved funds, the department cannot launch new initiatives  including one to beef up the Secret Service, which faced criticism after an intruder last year was able to hop the fence and enter the White House., \"Theyre willing to put the Department of Homeland Securitys budget at risk,\" said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), the minority whip, in the chamber Monday. \"Its just wrong to take out your frustration by putting at risk critical Homeland Security funding.\", The new Republican chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), has proposed a similarly tough immigration measure, despite the threat of a presidential veto., \"Sometimes you have to go through that process to show what our thought process is  to highlight the executive overreach,\" he said. \"We should fight hard for our beliefs. And we will.\", Some suspect that Republican leaders may be allowing hard-liners to present their proposals on the assumption that the Senate will quickly reject them, clearing the way for more measured legislation. Both McConnell and Boehner have said flatly that they will not allow the Homeland Security Department to run out of money., As Republicans head Wednesday to Hershey, Pa., known as \"the sweetest place on Earth,\" leaders find themselves in a familiar position. Even though this year marks the first time in 10 years that House and Senate Republicans will meet jointly, the gathering may only do more to solidify the conservative ranks than to temper them., lisa.mascaro@latimes.com, Twitter: @lisamascaro ]", "Date": "20150113", "Title": "[Immigration a major hurdle to Republican unity in Congress]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-gop-immigration-20150113-story.html", "Author": "[Lisa Mascaro]"}
{"Content": "[[, As Republicans take control Tuesday of both chambers of Congress for the first time in eight years, party leaders hope to move quickly to confront President Obama and showcase their conservative ideology, including austere budget cuts and dismantling government regulation., But continuing GOP divisions, a lack of clear leadership and some recent high-profile scandals are already distracting from the partys ambitious policy agenda., First up, possibly this week, will be House votes to approve the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, followed later by moves to undo Obamas immigration policies and a budget battle with Democrats over lower tax rates and less government spending., Without a clear Republican presidential front-runner to guide the way, it will fall to House Speaker John A. Boehner and incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to set the course and keep the partys conservative wing in check., First Boehner must clear his own reelection as speaker Tuesday. Though a small number of Republicans have signaled displeasure with Boehner as party leader  rekindling memories of conservatives failed coup two years ago to oust the speaker  Boehner is expected to retain his hold on power., But despite expectations that he and McConnell would move swiftly to show Americans that a GOP-led Congress can govern effectively, it remains unclear how the leaders will proceed. As of Friday, the House schedule for the opening week was still not set., That stands in contrast to the \"100 hour\" agenda promised by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) after Democrats seized control from Republicans in 2006 and delivered swift votes on ethics reform, a minimum wage hike and other campaign trail promises., Republican priorities will probably come into sharper focus later this month during a private out-of-state retreat to map the agenda for the year ahead. It is the first time in recent years that all Republicans from both chambers will huddle to plot strategy., \"The new American Congress will bring us an opportunity to begin anew, and as Sen. McConnell and I have pledged, the peoples priorities will be our priorities,\" Boehner said recently. \"Weve also made clear that early on, well make a direct challenge to the presidents unilateral actions on immigration.\", The difficult part will be finding a middle ground inside the Republican Party. On a series of issues, including immigration and tax reform, party leaders must bridge the divide between tea party supporters who want to use the new Republican majorities to move aggressively against the president and the more pragmatic wing that wants to avoid extreme positions, particularly in the run-up to the 2016 presidential race., Democrats are already dismissing Boehners \"new American Congress,\" pointing to recent headline-grabbing controversies that they say evoke familiar negative stereotypes about Republican thinking on minorities and women., The No. 3 House Republican, Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, apologized last week for delivering a 2002 talk to a white-supremacist group headed by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. So far, Scalises contrition has appeased many in his party, including Boehner and the No. 2 Republican, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield, who depend on the Louisianians conservative credentials and good-natured leadership to corral the Houses often rambunctious wing. But it is unclear whether Scalises recent ascent to party leadership will withstand this episode., \"It was a mistake I regret,\" Scalise said of his appearance before the European American Unity and Rights Organization, labeled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. \"And I emphatically oppose the divisive racial and religious views groups like these hold.\", Around the same time, New York Republican Rep. Michael G. Grimm announced he would resign after pleading guilty to tax evasion stemming from his past co-ownership of a Manhattan restaurant. Grimm won reelection in November, despite widespread negative media attention and a videotaped threat to throw a reporter who asked about his financial dealings off a Capitol balcony., Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) remains on the job after his former communications director sued his office for sexual harassment. A legal filing included lurid details about the congressmans alleged pursuit of red-headed women., \"The congressman will not let the outrageous claims of a disgruntled former employee interfere with his representing the people of Texas,\" spokesman Kurt Bardella said in an email late last week. \"He plans to continue to fight for lower taxes, more and better jobs and a smaller government.\", Like Grimm, the Corpus Christi-area congressman, elected in the 2010 tea party wave, won reelection last fall despite an opponents ad that recycled an earlier photo of him wearing pajamas with a scantily-clad woman., \"Republicans are off to a banner start for their new Congress,\" quipped a recent missive from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, predicting they were \"on the path to break their own record for least popular Congress in history.\", To be sure, Democrats have their own hurdles ahead as the partys progressive wing, increasingly led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, is poised to block Obamas efforts to strike deals with Republicans., Divisions between the White House and Democrats on Capitol Hill came into stark focus after the damaging midterm election, when each blamed the other for the partys losses., Liberal Democrats have little interest in Obamas effort to work with the GOP to approve a far-reaching trans-Pacific trade agreement with Asian nations, which they say will cost American jobs. Neither do progressives back his pursuit of corporate tax cuts that they warn would deprive the government of needed revenue. But as the minority party now in both houses, Democrats role has diminished., For Republicans, their performance in the coming months will become a referendum not only on their ability to lead  a key question in the 2016 presidential race  but on what has become the partys increasingly conservative ideology., The incoming House Budget Chairman, Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, vows to deliver a spending blueprint that builds on the austerity outlined by his predecessor, Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), the former vice presidential nominee, with cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and other safety-net programs., With the first Republican congressional majority since 2006, social conservatives are expected to push for legislation to curtail abortions and limit same-sex marriage, though such bills would probably be blocked by Democratic filibusters in the Senate or presidential vetoes., Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and others with 2016 presidential aspirations are certain to jockey for influence among their conservative peers., One early battle will come next month when Congress must renew funding for the Homeland Security Department. Though other government operations have been funded until September, Republicans agreed to only a short-term extension for Homeland Security, which oversees immigration agencies, as a protest against Obamas plan to defer deportation for up to 5 million people living in the U.S. illegally., To minimize the infighting, Boehners team is hoping to start this week with an easy legislative lift: a modest bipartisan bill to encourage small businesses to hire military veterans., But in a volley to Obama, the bill does so by making a tweak to the Affordable Care Act, the first of what will probably be many attempts by the GOP-led Congress to scale back the presidents signature program., lisa.mascaro@latimes.com]", "Date": "20150105", "Title": "[Republicans take helm of Congress, but initial course is unclear]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-congress-gop-20150105-story.html", "Author": "[Lisa Mascaro]"}
{"Content": "[[, As the author of a new book about the Clinton Foundation ramps up his publicity tour, Hillary Rodham Clintons presidential campaign believes it has already turned a corner in confronting his accusations of cozy connections between the organizations donors and Clintons State Department., Given the dearth of challengers for the Democratic nomination for president, its not surprising that Clintons most formidable opponent in her two weeks as an announced candidate has been herself. Her biggest hurdle hasproved to be her husbands post-presidential foundation, in which she recently added her name., On Sunday, the Clinton Foundation sought to address the many questions raised about the donations that help fuel its work, just as Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer appeared on network news shows., The New York Times, based in part on Schweizers work, reported on a flow of cash to the Clinton Foundation for five years from people with ties to a uranium-mining company that controlled some U.S. production capacity. The firm was later sold to a Russian state-owned agency, a transaction approved by a U.S. government committee that Hillary Clinton sat on as secretary of State., \"The fundamental question is, with this deal and the others we cite in this book, is it coincidence in a pattern we see repeated dozens of times where large Clinton supporters have business before the State Department, they make large payments, and favorable actions are taken, Schweizer said in an interview on Fox News Sunday. \"I dont think that coincidences occur that frequently., But when pressed in another interview on ABCs This Week, Schweizer conceded he did not have direct evidence linking the financial transactions to any actions Clinton may have been able to influence while running the State Department. Still, he insisted his work warranted further investigation., In a memo addressed to friends and allies, Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said Schweizers innuendo hasnt withstood scrutiny., Today, we believe we turned a corner as the author himself  conceded multiple times on national TV that his conspiracy theories lack any evidence and that he omitted key facts from his own reporting, Fallon wrote., The campaign had previously maintained that the Clintons were rightfully proud of the foundations work, calling it a world-class philanthropy that has helped millions through its work on such issues as AIDS and climate change. The campaign had sought to bring attention to Schweizers own past connections to Republican donors., One of the first questions Clinton responded to from a reporter on the campaign trail was about the claims made in Clinton Cash.\", Were back into the political season, and therefore we will be subjected to all kinds of distractions and attacks, she said in New Hampshire last week. Im ready for that., Maura Pally, the Clinton Foundations acting chief executive, acknowledged Sunday that mistakes were made in recent tax filings that included government grants with other donations, and that steps were being taken to quickly remedy them. She also rejected claims that the foundation, which includes 11 initiatives with their own organizational structures, had sought to avoid transparency., Today, our donor disclosure and foreign government contributor policy is stronger than ever, Pally wrote., After Clinton announced her candidacy April 12, the foundation  rebranded the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013 after Clintons time at the State Department came to an end  said it would disclose its donors four times a year instead of once. It also narrowed to six the number of foreign governments from which it would accept funding  nations that had preexisting partnerships for foundation programs., Pallys statement notes that the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership has come under heightened scrutiny but does not specifically address Schweizers suggestion of a potential quid pro quo, a task left to Clintons campaign and an outside Democratic group that also issued a lengthy reality check., 3:21 p.m.: The story was updated throughout.]", "Date": "20150427", "Title": "[Hillary Clinton's campaign fights accusations against family foundation]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-clinton-foundation-mistakes-20150426-story.html", "Author": "[Michael A.

That we need to pick a nominee as soon as possible, that we have to unite around whichever candidate appears to have the most money or the most endorsements or the best press coverage, Christie told a sold-out luncheon crowd at the state GOPs biannual convention here., Take a deep breath, everybody, Christie said.

Initially considered a top-tier candidate, he has seen GOP rivals scoop up major donors and exhibit popularity in opinion polls, and he has been buffeted by a series of controversies., Overhauling New Jerseys public pension system had been one of Christies signature acts, but earlier this week, a judge found that Christie had violated the law and ordered him to reverse a $1.57-billion cut in the pension program., Federal authorities are investigating Bridgegate  the closure of traffic lanes on the George Washington Bridge as political payback by a Christie aide against a mayor who didnt endorse Christies reelection., Christie has come under scrutiny for lavish travel and the amount of time he spends outside of his state, and his approval ratings have sunk to historic lows among New Jersey voters., He did not mention these matters, instead touting his election -- twice -- in a blue state, five balanced budgets and tax cuts for businesses.

{"Content": "[[, As the number of candidates seeking the Republican nomination nears a dozen, with more to come, the calendar of primaries has drawn increased attention, with party strategists trying to determine which contests will begin to winnow the field., Though the calendar remains unsettled, several Southern states, including Alabama and Arkansas, are looking to have an effect on the race by holding contests on the same date - creating a so-called SEC primary, named after the college sports Southeastern Conference., In Florida, Republicans have rallied around a winner-take-all primary that could be a jackpot in the race for delegates and potentially determine the electoral fate of the states former governor, Jeb Bush and its current Republican senator, Marco Rubio., And in Nevada, lawmakers weighed legislation -- championed by Republicans -- that would have allowed parties to choose between the current caucus system or a primary. Late Monday, the legislation stalled as the session came to a close, likely killing the proposal for this election cycle., What we have right now is a very compressed calendar with important contests taking place within several weeks of one another, said Josh Putnam, a visiting assistant professor of political science at Appalachian State University in North Carolina, who studies primaries and writes the blog FrontloadingHQ., It wont be nearly as elongated as the last cycle., The compression of the current calendar, with Iowa and New Hampshire likely to kick off the voting process in early February, followed by South Carolina and Nevada toward the middle and end of the month, creates a different dynamic than 2012, Putnam said., In the last cycle, Republicans blamed a faulty primary system for a protracted nomination contest that ran from early January to April., The rules last time allowed several weeks between contests and did not deter states, particularly Florida, from moving their primaries earlier than usual. In this cycle, Republicans have adopted tough rules to prevent states other than Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada from holding contests in February. States that violate the rules and try to start early would see their number of convention delegates sharply reduced., With March 1 as the earliest time most states can vote, several Southern states are eyeing that date for a Super Tuesday battle that could give a boost to a Southern Republican such as former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee or Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas., Arkansas and Texas, along with Alabama, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Virginia, each plan to hold their primaries on that date., Alabamas 2012 primary was held in mid-March, which was still considered late in the cycle, said Brent Buchanan, aRepublican strategist based in Montgomery, Ala., Its going to really be historic in that presidential candidates will have to give serious attention to the South, said Buchanan, adding theres a buzz with people saying, Hey, we really matter this election. \", In Florida, which is set to hold its primary two weeks after, on March 15, Republicans last month voted to award all the states 99 delegates to the primary winner instead of distributing them proportionally., We know that Florida is a prize  and the candidate to win here is going to get a big prize, state GOP Chairman Blaise Ingoglia said. Were a swing state with large cities statewide., Bush and Rubio have deep roots in the state and many political observers believe the primary - which will cost candidates and outside groups several million dollars for advertising - will probably be a race between the two men., Joining Florida as a swing state in the general election is Nevada, which also has early state status in the primary., Legislators there debated a measure that would have allowed each party to decide whether to hold a caucus or a primary., Caucuses consist of local gatherings - in venues such as school gymnasiums or public libraries - where voters decide which candidate to support and also typically select delegates for state nominating conventions. A primary is a statewide election in which voters cast secret ballots., Nevada Assembly Speaker John Hambrick, a Republican from Las Vegas who co-sponsored the legislation, said a primary  run by the secretary of states office -- is what the state GOP needed to make the election more seamless and boost turnout., With so many Republicans running for the White House, we have to be certain each vote is counted with precision, especially as an early state, said Hambrick, prior to the legislation stalling out Monday., In 2012, fewer than 33,000 of the states 400,000 registered Republicans voted in the caucuses., That year libertarian supporters of former Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) helped him finish third in the voting, with about 19%., Keeping the caucus system for this election cycle is likely to aid Pauls son, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who tweeted on Tuesday that hes looking forward to the caucuses. His tweet included a link to a story that noted the primary legislation had been spiked., Despite the condensed primary calendar, the nominating process could still stretch on because of the ability of mega-donors to keep favored candidates afloat by spending unlimited sums through \"super PACs.\" That was what occurred in 2012, when casino magnate Sheldon Adelson bankrolled a super PAC supporting former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and kept his campaign going well into the spring, even after it was clear his delegate total could not surpass Mitt Romneys., Still, Putnam, who researches primaries, sees the calendar as the driving force., Millionaires and billionaires are not going to want to give additional money and pay when its clear its for a losing cause, he said The compressed calendar will likely winnow the field faster, and thats certainly what the GOP wants headed into the general election., kurtis.lee@latimes.com, Twitter: kurtisalee, 12:25 p.m. This post has been updated with additional information., 7:50 a.m.: This post has been updated to clarify the status of the Nevada proposal., 6:25 a.m.: This post has been updated with information about Nevadas legislation., This post was originally published at 3 a.m.]", "Date": "20150602", "Title": "[With big field, unsettled primary calendar adds complexity to GOP race]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-primary-schedule-20150602-story.html", "Author": "[Kurtis Lee]"}
{"Content": "[[, As the two political parties begin to gear up for next years presidential election, the public has a more positive general image of the Democrats but trust Republicans more on specifics, a newly released survey shows., The survey released Thursday by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center suggests an important underlying dynamic for the presidential contest:, A Republican nominee may be able to count on a presumption that he or she will be able to handle major issues, but will be challenged on empathy and tolerance, as Mitt Romney was in 2012., The Democratic nominee may be able to take those attributes for granted, at least to some extent, but will need to reassure the public about his or her abilities on managing issues., Large segments of the public believe each party has strong principles. Asked if either has \"good policy ideas,\" just over half say the Democrats do and just under half say Republicans do., But the overall images of the parties differ markedly., About six in 10 American adults say the Democratic party cares about the middle class and is tolerant and open to all groups of people, the poll found., By contrast, only about one-third of Americans say Republicans are tolerant and open to all, and just over four in 10 say they care about the middle class., Half say the Republicans are too extreme, considerably more than the share -- just over one-third -- who say that about the Democrats., But asked which party could do a better job on seven major issues, the public gives Republicans the edge on three and the Democrats on only one, the survey showed., Republicans run ahead of Democrats on handling terrorism and taxes, two traditional areas of strength for them., The poll also found a large Republican advantage on making wise decisions about foreign policy., Thats the first significant advantage for the GOP on that question since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq soured the public more than a decade ago on the GOPs leadership overseas., The GOP edge on foreign policy developed suddenly after a long period of rough parity between the parties on that subject, apparently reflecting a spate of foreign problems that have troubled the Obama administration in the last few months., As recently as October, the two parties were even on foreign affairs in Pews surveys. Now, the public prefers the GOP by 13 points, 48% to 35%., Republicans enjoy a 21-point lead on foreign policy among men, 52%-31%, while women divide much more closely, with 44% giving the edge to the GOP and 39% to the Democrats., Much of the shift since October has involved self-identified independents, who have moved toward the GOP on foreign policy, the poll found., Typically, a large percentage of independents do not follow news as closely as partisans on either side, and their opinions on major issues sometimes shift more slowly than those of more engaged voters., The only issue on which the Democrats had a significant edge was handling healthcare, the poll found. Democrats have a 7-point margin on that issue, 47% to 40%., The Democrats advantage on healthcare persists even though a majority remain unimpressed with their signature achievement on the issue, the Affordable Care Act., By 53%-45%, the public has a negative view of the law. On the other hand, by 50%-45%, Americans say they believe the laws major provisions are probably here to stay., Democrats and independents both say the law is probably permanent. Only among Republicans do a majority say that the laws major provisions will probably be eliminated., The public divides roughly evenly between the two parties on the three other issues tested -- handling the economy, immigration, and abortion and contraception, the poll found., On some of those issues, however, notable gaps appear among certain groups. On immigration, for example, Latinos favor the Democrats by about 3-1, while white Americans favor the GOP, 52%-36%. On abortion and contraception, men divide equally between the two parties, while women favor the Democrats, 45%-38%., On the economy, men lean toward the GOP by a small margin, while women narrowly favor the Democrats., As with other surveys, the new poll found that President Obamas job approval has ticked up since last fall. The Pew survey shows 48% of the public approving the presidents job performance and 46% disapproving., Obama is considerably more popular than the leaders of the Republican Congress, who receive approval from 26%., But asked who should take the lead in solving the nations problems, the public is far more closely divided, with 40% saying Obama while 38% pick the GOP leaders., That division has not changed significantly from the period around last Novembers mid-term election, which led to a Republican takeover of Congress and many statehouses around the country., Part of the discrepancy between the answers to those two questions  popularity and which should lead -- comes about because the GOP leadership is relatively unpopular even within the GOP., Only half of Republicans say they approve of the job that their congressional leaders are doing. By contrast, about two thirds of Democrats approve of their partys congressional leadership., But those same Republicans who disapprove of the GOP leadership disapprove of Obama even more and are inclined to want the GOP to lead on issues., The Pew survey was conducted last Feb. 18 through Sunday, questioning 1,504 adults by cellphone and landline. The findings have a margin of error of +/- 2.9 percentage points., For more on politics and policy, follow@DavidLauter on Twitter., 11:40 a.m.: This article has been updated with additional data on the attitudes of some subgroups in the electorate., This article was originally published at 7 a.m.]", "Date": "20150226", "Title": "[Americans have more positive view of Democrats, trust GOP on issues]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-party-images-20150226-story.html", "Author": "[David Lauter]"}
{"Content": "[[, As we turn to the new year, the members of this board traditionally offer our hopes for the future and reflect on the status of our wishes for the last 12 months. Thats a sobering process  reminding us that we often wish for more than we get. This year is no different, though a few did come true., Congress, for instance, granted one of our wishes, going the entire year without a manufactured crisis that wrecked, or threatened to wreck, the economy. It says something about the nations elected leadership, however, that one has to wish for it not to do harm, as if hoping it would actually help is too much to consider., Congress also almost granted a second wish from our list, as lawmakers came up with a bipartisan plan to improve the payment system for Medicare doctors. That fell short, however, as did efforts to come to a deal on immigration, leading President Obama to issue another controversial  but welcome  executive order setting clearer priorities for deportations., The Supreme Court, meanwhile, elected not to make its hearings more readily available on audio to the public, and conservatives kept up their dopey insistence that gay marriage somehow undermines religious liberty  denying us our wishes in both areas., Closer to home, Los Angeles voters shrugged off important elections despite our plea to participate; low turnout continues to undermine elections at all levels. And Hollywood laughed off our wish for a superhero movie in which a woman stars rather than appearing as a love interest., On the other hand, some people may have taken our wishes too seriously. Though we supported and admired Los Angeles Unified School Supt. John Deasy, we urged him to calm down a bit in his fights with the school board. Instead, he resigned. And we asked Sheriff Lee Baca to shape up his department; he too opted to quit, but at least his department now stands ready to improve under its new chief, Sheriff Jim McDonnell., So it is with heartfelt hope and some trepidation that we once again enter this field. In 2015, we wish for:, Faster growth in the U.S. and California economies. As 2014 drew to a close and the national unemployment rate fell below 6%, we saw the first tentative signs that wages were starting to grow. Thats a trend worth nurturing, considering how long wages have stagnated for low- and middle-income Americans., A concerted effort by the Legislature and the Los Angeles City Council to make it as easy to start a business here as it is to move to Texas., Pope Francis to give the news media a break by preaching the occasional boring sermon., Rain. Lots of it., An overhaul of the federal tax code that broadens the tax base by winnowing the thicket of tax breaks, allowing lawmakers to lower rates without driving up the deficit., An end to the impasse between Time Warner Cable and other local pay-TV operators that kept Los Angeles Dodgers games off most of their fans TVs., The Supreme Court to stop hinting and issue a definitive ruling that bans on same-sex marriage violate the Constitutions guarantee of due process of law and equal protection of the laws., Critics of Obamacare to stop trying to repeal the law or render it unworkable through the courts. Instead, Republicans should use their newfound control of Congress to address the acts shortcomings and do more to slow the growth of healthcare costs. One bug that needs fixing right away: the lack of premium subsidies for those who have access to affordable individual policies at work, but not affordable family coverage. It would be especially gratifying  though probably unlikely  if Republicans would use their clout in general to govern responsibly rather than to engage in pointless confrontation with the president., Did we mention rain?, Funding in the state budget for the nascent earthquake early-warning system. Now that Congress has kicked in $5 million, its time for Sacramento to ante up., Los Angeles City Council races that are full of substance and bold ideas and that are so engaging that voters flock to the polls and the city can reverse its pitiful trend of low-turnout elections. Admittedly, this is a long shot, but after a 2013 mayors race that drew just 23% of registered voters, candidates need to do their part to persuade the electorate that these campaigns matter., A whole roster full of Clayton Kershaws., Congress to finally pass legislation to prohibit discrimination in private employment on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity., College students who burn with righteousness indignation  which is to say, college students  to recognize that opposing views should be challenged, not censored., New regulations by the Federal Communications Commission that protect the open Internet from interference by broadband service providers, without discouraging the investments in broadband needed to meet the growing demands of an increasingly connected world., Snow., Metro and Caltrans to finally finish the last remnants of construction  the \"punch list\"  on the half-decade 405 Freeway project and liberate every onramp and offramp from intermittent closures., A spirit of innovation and cooperation among our four new elected county leaders to help meet the most daunting challenges that fall into the countys lap: homelessness, mental health, poverty, child abuse and neglect, health. And as they address those pressing problems, heres to hoping they also maintain the budget discipline that in recent years has distinguished the county from city government and left the county in a stronger fiscal position., Some aggressive critiquing of Los Angeles city government by Controller Ron Galperin. The cooperation among top city leaders is a welcome change from the customary sniping, but theres a place for scrutiny and oversight, and Galperins the person to carry out that job., A continuing drop in gasoline prices to allow people to put more money into the economy. Or, wait  an increase in gasoline prices to keep the incentive intact for developing cleaner fuels and encouraging businesses and residents to cluster in walkable, livable neighborhoods? We cant decide. Can we have both?, More support from TV networks for online alternatives to the ever-more-expensive offerings of cable and satellite TV operators., Hollywood to realize that not every movie has to be a sequel, a prequel or a knockoff., A new commitment to intelligent leadership at the Los Angeles Unified School District. As noted above, in 2014, members of the school board squabbled with their superintendent, John Deasy, and he ultimately left. That deprives the board and district of an intelligent and devoted leader, but also offers the opportunity for a fresh start. The board should make the most of it., President Obama to make good on his 6-year-old promise to close the detention center at Guantanamo. Weve wished for this before. Hope dies hard., Los Angeles to end veteran homelessness by 2016. Mayor Eric Garcetti pledged to find homes for the estimated 2,600 homeless veterans living within the city limits by the end of this year, as part of an Obama administration push to end veteran homelessness nationwide. This will require funding, private partnerships and a fully engaged Veterans Affairs Administration. Its an ambitious and worthy goal., The Los Angeles City Council to approve the mayors proposal for long-overdue mandatory retrofitting of thousands of soft-story wood buildings and brittle concrete ones that could suffer devastating destruction in a major earthquake., Airlines to get the message that diminishing legroom and shrinking seats are making travelers go crazy. Last year, at least three planes made unplanned landings after passengers got into fights over the ability to recline their seats. Its either more room or more fights., An end to the death penalty in the United States. This past year the nation saw the fewest executions in two decades amid persistent reports of the wrongly convicted being exonerated  there were seven such cases in 2014. With Californias death penalty on hold over two constitutional issues  the method of execution, and lengthy delays that a judge ruled make it too arbitrary to be legally applied  the state maintains the nations largest death row. The death penalty does not significantly deter violent crime, and it engages the government in the machinery of killing. Most modern nations have rejected it.

{"Content": "[[, As Wisconsin Gov.Scott Walkerhas jumped into the front ranks of GOP presidential hopefuls over the last several weeks, he has shifted further to the right on such issues as abortion and immigration, closely aligning himself with the views of conservative activist voters he hopes will propel his candidacy., The latest example came Monday as Walker signed a bill that reduces the power of private-sector unions. The new law ends unions ability to collect mandatory fees from workers they represent who refuse to join and pay dues. Wisconsin is the 25th state, and the third in the industrial Midwest, to adopt such a law, which its supporters call right-to-work., Walker lost no time in trumpeting the move, sending a fundraising email predicting the law would have an \"immediate positive effect on our economy.\", \"Labor bosses will never forgive me for taking away their power,\" Walker told supporters, asking for money to \"continue our conservative reforms.\", Voters nationwide will probably see a lot more of that aggressive approach to conservative goals from Walker. As much as any politician this decade, he has built his career around the insight that in highly polarized times, the path to victory lies through mobilizing ones own partisans, not trying to appeal to sometimes-mythical centrists., His course on the union bill shows how Walker has sought to turn up the volume on his conservatism as he has pursued his still-unofficial drive for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. Right-to-work laws have been a conservative goal since the 1940s, but Walker had distanced himself from them until recently., \"I dont have any interest in doing anything to private unions. I think the private unions are a key part to getting this states economy going,\" Walker said at a news conference early in 2011., That remark came during the bitter fight over his bill to strip Wisconsins government-worker unions of most collective bargaining powers. His successful battle with those unions defined Walkers first term and made him a national conservative hero., But Walker kept a hands-off position on private-sector unions. At one point, he said he would \"do everything in my power\" to keep a right-to-work bill from coming to his desk. Late last year, when Republicans who hold the majority in the state Legislature pushed the bill, Walker called it a \"distraction.\" That drew criticism from some prominent conservative voices, including the Wall St. Journals influential editorial page., Earlier this year, he changed course and said he would sign the bill. The pledge to stave it off, he now says, applied only to his first term., Walkers moves on right-to-work and other issues have bolstered his claim on becoming the main conservative alternative to former Florida Gov. JebBushin the GOP presidential race. Thats particularly crucial in Iowa, where conservatives play a big role in the caucuses that kick off the national nominating season. Recent polls have shown Walker with support from between one-fifth and one-quarter of potential caucus voters, putting him atop the field and well ahead of Bush., Mark Costello, 53, who grows corn and soybeans on about 500 acres outside Imogene, in western Iowa, is typical of the potential caucus goers who are giving Walker favorable reviews., \"Right now, I really like Gov. Walker,\" he said at a candidate forum over the weekend. \"I really like what Gov. Walker has done with some of his boldness.\", Boldness defines Walkers approach. After winning the governors job in 2010, he launched his collective bargaining bill as a surprise; it had not figured in his campaign. He won passage of the measure in 2011, defeated a recall campaign in the spring of 2012, then won reelection last year., His repeated victories in a state that has gone to the Democrats in every presidential election since 1984 have increased his attraction for national conservative groups, big donors and many Republican voters., \"Hes the only Republican in my lifetime who has actually beaten the Democrats at something  substantively defeated  at least since Reagan,\" said Steve Deace, a well-known Iowa conservative talk-radio host., Walkers ascent has drawn Democrats attention as well. President Obama issued a statement Monday night saying he was disappointed by what he called an \"anti-worker law\" that would harm \"hardworking middle-class families.\", With voters like those in Deaces audience key to Walkers political future, he has moved right on several other issues this winter., Until recently, for example, he tried to downplay abortion. Late in 2013, at a breakfast with reporters in Washington, Walker said Republicans should emphasize an economic message, not social issues., \"As governors, we focus on the things that matter most to people,\" he said, listing jobs and the economy. \"Im pro-life,\" he added. \"I dont apologize about it, but I dont focus on it.\", Nearly a year later, in his campaign for reelection, he faced Democrat Mary Burke, who did focus on abortion. Walker ranan adcalling the decision on whether to end a pregnancy an \"agonizing one\" on which \"reasonable people can disagree.\" Legislation he had backed as governor \"leaves the final decision to a woman and her doctor,\" the ad said., This month, he took a sharper-edged tone, saying inan open letterto a prominent antiabortion group that he would sign a bill in Wisconsin to ban all abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy., On immigration, Walker had made a number of ambiguously worded statements over the last couple of years that suggested he could support a path to citizenship, or at least legal status, for the estimated 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally., \"My view has changed,\" Walker said in aFox News interviewthis month. A plan such as the one that passed the Senate in 2013, which allows unauthorized immigrants to pay fines, to go through a waiting period and then to qualify for citizenship, amounts to \"amnesty,\" he said, echoing the stand taken by conservative opponents., \"I dont believe in amnesty,\" he said., Those shifts reflect a strategic imperative Walker faces  the need to consolidate conservative support, particularly in Iowa., \"If he doesnt win Iowa, I dont see the path for him,\" a veteran GOP strategist in the state who is expected to support Bush said over the weekend, speaking on condition of anonymity to assess a potential rival., That statement reflects the Bush campaigns desire to set expectations high for Walker in Iowa. But most analysts would agree that if Walker cant win in a neighboring state with a large number of voters who share his conservative politics and evangelical faith, hes not likely clear of the field elsewhere., Playing to Iowa voters has extended to parochial issues as well as national ones. In the past, Walker had espoused a free-market position in expressing doubts about a federal law that mandates the use of ethanol in gasoline. But opposition to the ethanol rule, known as the Renewable Fuels Standard, would put him at odds with many Iowa corn and soybean farmers who have profited significantly from it., Over the weekend, at an Iowa candidate forum sponsored by supporters of the ethanol mandate, some GOP hopefuls stuck to the free-market stance. The two Texans likely to join the race, Sen. Ted Cruz and former Gov.Rick Perry, both criticized ethanol requirements. Walker did not., \"Its something Im willing to go forward on,\" he said., david.lauter@latimes.com, Twitter: @DavidLauter, seema.mehta@latimes.com, Twitter: @LATSeema, Lauter reported from Washington and Mehta from Des Moines., 8:01 p.m.: The story was updated throughout with new details., 12:27 p.m.: The story was updated with additional information about Gov.

Now, the job market is \"coming out of a coma.\", Theres work for his members in the $7.5-billion water bond approved by voters in November, mainly in water recycling projects and construction of dams and reservoirs., Therell be more work if Brown secures approval for his Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta tunnels, a controversial $25-billion plan for sending water from Northern California to farmlands and cities farther south., The $68-billion bullet train project has been besieged by lawsuits, construction delays, uncertain funding and lackluster popular support. But the building trades have remained its most tenacious supporters, arm-twisting for key votes in the Capitol to move the project along and shelling out for billboards extolling high-speed rail, which will be built solely by union labor., \"Its a fantastic deal for them.... Youre not going to be able to get a job working on that unless you go through the union hiring hall,\" said Kevin Dayton, a public policy consultant who previously worked for Associated Builders and Contractors, a trade group for nonunion contractors., Last year, the governor breathed new financial life into the rail project by coupling it with another of his policy priorities: combating climate change. He persuaded the Legislature to designate to high-speed rail a quarter of the funds generated annually by state fees on polluters  more than half a billion dollars for the project by June 2016., The move also made the building trades an enthusiastic partner in Browns effort to reduce carbon emissions, which the labor group had previously backed, though much less forcefully., \"To get our support on that  [Brown] was pretty sharp,\" Hunter said., Now, as climate change policy dominates the Capitol, Hunters group has been a visible and gung-ho ally in the push for green energy. At the kick-off event for a package of climate bills by Sen. Kevin De Len (D-Los Angeles), Hunter was at the Senate leaders side, praising the plans emphasis on green jobs as hard-hatted workers stood behind him., Hunter takes pains to note that the governor \"says no to us, too.\" The group, seeking to maximize water infrastructure projects to build, pushed for a larger water bond measure than the one that appeared on the ballot, but lost that battle to the governors distaste for larger debt., Calls for a statewide school construction bond, which also would have meant jobs for the unions members, have so far been dismissed by Brown., The councils policy plays are bolstered by its campaign giving. It poured nearly $3 million into last years elections, including $1 million to Democratic Party committees and the maximum allowed to Browns reelection bid. In 2010, the group put $1.3 million into an independent effort supporting his run against Republican challenger Meg Whitman., The group has also given to Republican legislators and candidates, a rarity among labor unions., Many of the trades in the alliance also have their own lobbyists and political arms, amplifying their Capitol presence. That can lead to competing interests and turf wars; Hunter likened the consortium, which he has led since 2012, to a \"large Italian or Irish family.\", While elsewhere in the nation builder unions and environmentalists have clashed, most recently over the blocked Keystone XL pipeline, the California building trades forged an alliance with environmental groups around the states landmark environmental law, the California Environmental Quality Act., Still, the trades manage to maintain a relationship with business that, for a labor union, is uncommonly friendly. Rob Lapsley, president of the California Business Roundtable, invited Hunter to speak at his board meeting last year., And Lapsley praised the unions apprenticeship programs, which create more trained workers. \"They teach people a lifelong trade,\" he said. \"They take someone who may not be going to college and give them a skill set that is vital to Californias economy.\", Hunters trade spans his familys generations  a legacy evident in his Sacramento office. Behind his desk hangs a photo of John Quinn, his great-grandfather and a force in Belfasts labor history. Near the door is a photograph of Hunter himself, working on the then-unfinished Library Tower, a signature Los Angeles skyscraper., Recently, a new photo rested on the floor at the headquarters, waiting to be hung: the governor and first lady signing the bullet trains symbolic first beam, with Hunter, pen in hand, at their side., melanie.mason@latimes.comTwitter: @melmason]", "Date": "20150405", "Title": "[Trade workers set to benefit from Gov.

{"Content": "[[, At the end of President Obamas sixth year in office, the commander in chief who once vowed to end Americas longest period of war still maintains thousands of troops in Afghanistan and Iraq  conflicts that refuse to conform to neat White House timetables., The end of this year marks an end to the official combat role for the U.S. in Afghanistan. As 2015 dawns, U.S. troops transition to a training and support role, even as the Taliban is increasing its attacks. And in Iraq, more U.S. troops will be on the way to a war that was supposed to be over, at least as far as the U.S. goes., Obama long ago recognized, at least privately, that in seeking to extricate American troops from wars abroad, he was not ending those conflicts, only Americas involvement in them. But even that goal has proved stubbornly elusive., Heres a primer on what lies ahead in 2015 for the Pentagon in both places:, Hasnt Obama succeeded in shrinking the U.S. military presence?, Yes. In Afghanistan, the U.S. has carried out a major withdrawal over the last two years, shrinking its troop presence from about 100,000 at the height of the war to 10,800 today. Thats the level authorized by the White House through early next spring, when it is due to drop again, to 9,800. All U.S. troops are due to leave by the end of 2016, except a small contingent attached to the U.S. Embassy., But Iraq has shown how hard it is to follow such timetables. The U.S. pulled all its troops out in December 2011. But last August, Obama announced plans to send about 1,500 troops back when Islamic State militants swept in from Syria and took control of large parts of the country. Obama recently decided to roughly double the U.S. troop level to 3,100. Thousands more are supporting the effort from bases in the region., What are the troops doing?, A mix of missions. In Afghanistan, they work with military advisors from other countries to help train Afghan security forces, especially the nations still primitive air force. The goal is to professionalize a force that has shown a capability to fight but remains far from capable of sustaining itself over the long term. Most U.S. troops work at large bases in the countrys east and south, not at combat outposts., Despite White House insistence that the U.S. combat role is over, the troops could be forced to help defend the bases from insurgent attacks. About 4,000 special operations troops will continue to carry out raids against the remnants of Al Qaeda and their supporters. And U.S. forces will have authority to assist the Afghan military with airstrikes, supplies and even ground forces if it is in danger of a major defeat by insurgents., What about in Iraq?, The White House has put strict limits on the U.S. role there. No troops are supposed to be in ground combat. Special operations troops are advising Iraqi and Kurdish commanders from joint operations centers, where they coordinate airstrikes against Islamic State positions and convoys. U.S. officers are finalizing plans to begin retraining Iraqi ground forces, many of which collapsed last summer when the militants attacked, or are hindered by sectarian officers, poor equipment and large numbers of so-called ghost soldiers, who are on the payroll but dont show up. U.S. troops also coordinate delivery of U.S.-supplied weapons and equipment., So the U.S. wants to shift to a support mission and prevent U.S. casualties?, Mostly, yes. But carrying out such a shift isnt likely to go smoothly. Already in Afghanistan, as U.S. troops have withdrawn, Taliban insurgents have stepped up attacks, even in Kabul, the capital. Afghanistans new president, Ashraf Ghani, is worried about the ability of his troops to withstand the insurgents next year and is already lobbying U.S. officials to consider slowing down the timetable for withdrawing remaining U.S. forces., In Iraq, the timetable is more open-ended. U.S. officials warn that American troops may be needed for three years or more to help Iraq regain control of its territory and to keep pressure on Islamic State forces in neighboring Syria., How does the Pentagon feel about the White House strategy?, Many in uniform are glad to see the costly wars come to an end. On the other hand, some privately complain that Obamas goal of disengaging militarily, and his fondness for withdrawal deadlines, sacrificed many of the gains they fought for in Iraq and risks doing the same in Afghanistan. Having seen Iraq fall back into chaos after U.S troops left, they hope Obama will prove more flexible about keeping forces in Afghanistan if security there remains precarious., What are the stakes for Obama?, Politically, the White House is hoping that by shrinking the militarys mission and presence overseas, the public will give him credit for getting close enough to his goal of ending the wars without disengaging from the national security threats emanating from the region., But there is another scenario: If the Afghan Taliban shows continuing resurgence, Obama may face growing pressure from his commanders, Afghan officials and Republicans in control of Congress to expand the mission there. The same dynamic could arise in Iraq and Syria, where signs already suggest the U.S.-led airstrikes are reaching the limits of their ability to inflict damage on Islamic State militants., Before he leaves office in 2017, Obama may face a decision about whether he wants to be remembered as the president who brought the troops home or the one who left too quickly.]", "Date": "20141229", "Title": "[What lies ahead for U.S. military in Afghanistan, Iraq]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/world/afghanistan-pakistan/la-fg-year-ahead-military-20141229-story.html", "Author": "[David S.

Barbara Boxer announced she would not seek reelection in 2016., In the five weeks since then, Harris has been raising money and securing endorsements  some from former allies of Villaraigosa  but did no media interviews about her bid until Wednesday., Harris said she had been focused on her duties as the states top law enforcement official., \"Im 100% focused on doing my job as Californias attorney general,\" Harris said, citing her launch last week of a childrens justice bureau., Harris has also been raising campaign money. She declined to discuss her fundraising strategy., In addition to Villaraigosa, some Democratic members of Congress are weighing whether to enter the race. Among Republicans, Assemblyman Rocky Chavez of Oceanside and two former state party chairmen are pondering a run., Harris said she expected multiple debates with her opponents, whoever they are. She pointed to her resume as attorney general and San Francisco district attorney as rationales for her Senate bid., \"I think that California wants and needs a tough, practical and results-oriented approach and leader in the Senate,\" Harris said, \"especially, frankly, given the atmosphere in Washington today.\", Harris said she decided to run for Boxers seat because many of the priorities she has had as attorney general  consumer protection, veterans, immigration, the environment  are issues she would like to tackle at the federal level., \"All, I think, are very connected, directly connected to the work that Ive been doing and want to see through,\" Harris said., Harris acknowledged that she had not worked on foreign policy or national security  two critical areas of concern to the U.S. Senate  in her elected posts., \"Its something that is relatively new in terms of my professional work. Ive always had an interest in it, but theres a learning curve,\" Harris said, adding that she planned to spend the next several months studying, reading, consulting experts and \"really feeding my brain.\", On a critical foreign policy matter of the moment  fighting the Islamic State  Harris said she supported President Obamas approach., The president, in seeking authorization for the use of military force from Congress last week, proposed permitting airstrikes and U.S. training for Iraqi and Syrian ground forces for three years., The plan would forbid the use of ground troops for extended combat operations but would place no geographic limits on the effort., Some Republicans are concerned that the restrictions in the proposal would hamstring the military. Some Democrats fear that the authority Obama seeks is too broad and vague, a concern that Harris said she does not share \"at this point.\", \"As a general principle, I think it would be a great mistake for us to enter another ground war, and I support the presidents approach, which is that that is an area of last resort,\" Harris said., Duration limits and the need for Congress to authorize any further moves are a smart way to go, she said: \"We have learned without that, we may have unintended consequences.\", Harris sidestepped the current controversy over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus address to a joint session of Congress next month. Netanyahu was invited by House Speaker John Boehner without consulting the White House, leading some Democrats to vow to boycott the speech., Harris declined to say whether she would attend if she were a senator., \"I cant speculate about that at this point,\" Harris said, before emphasizing the importance of the United States relationship with Israel and the tiny nations ability to defend itself., seema.mehta@latimes.comTwitter: @LATSeema]", "Date": "20150218", "Title": "[Kamala Harris 'makes no apologies' for fast start to Senate race]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-pol-senate-harris-20150219-story.html", "Author": "[Seema Mehta]"}
{"Content": "[[, Before jetting off to Hawaii for his annual holiday break, President Obama stood before reporters to pat himself on the back on Friday. Hes proud of his accomplishments this year, he said. Hes shown America solves problems., \"And now Im going to go on vacation. Mele Kalikimaka, everybody,\" he said, wishing all a Merry Christmas in Hawaiian. \"Mahalo.\", It was a remarkable drop-the-mic moment coming from man who only a couple months ago was slogging through the doldrums of his underwhelming second term. Bouncing from seemingly unsolvable conflicts in Syria and Iraq, to a crushing defeat of Democrats in the midterm election, the president appeared ready to totter off into lame duck status., Apparently not., Within a few short weeks and through a few big executive maneuvers, Obama ended the year by reminding Washington that his demise is far from imminent. He began last month with a climate deal with China and a bold immigration order, then in the last two weeks helped bring about passage of a major spending bill, saw a blitz of judicial appointees through the Senate and reversed half a century of U.S. policy toward Cuba. Obama has demonstrated the power of the office and his willingness to use it  even at the expense of working with a new Republican majority in Congress., Aides and observers describe the Obama strategy as essentially a legacy-building plan familiar to most presidents in the end of their second term. In Obamas case, the approach of using his established executive and regulatory authority to act, rather than making deals with lawmakers, is based on a conclusion thats he likely to get little help from Congress in achieving his goals., More executive actions are coming, White House advisors say, showing little worry for whether such moves will continue to outrage Republicans or spoil the possibility of cooperation with Congress. The GOP and the president have areas of common ground, they contend, but Obama is not willing to wait for a Republican-led Congress to act when he can on his own., Obama pointed Friday to the year and a half he gave House Republicans to pass a bill to fix the immigration system, an ultimately futile wait, before he moved last month to protect up to 5 million people from the threat of deportation., \"I intend to continue to do what Ive been doing, which is: where I see a big problem and the opportunity to help the American people, and it is within my lawful authority to provide that help, Im going to do it,\" Obama said., He pledged to try to work with Republicans to try to pass broader legislation on his policy priorities, but next year Obama will face a Congress angered by his executive moves and with little incentive to work with him., At the moment, Republican leaders are trying to decide which Obama priority to fight first, be it gutting Obamacare, fighting his environmental regulations, forcing his hand to approve the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline or blocking his efforts at economic stimulus or immigration reform  all to counter Obamas vision and set the party up for a strong 2016., Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has already announced that the fate of the Keystone pipeline would be the first substantive vote of 2015., And House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) has vowed to set up \"a direct challenge to the presidents unilateral actions on immigration when we have new majorities in both chambers of Congress.\", In the face of such presumed irrelevance, Obama is hardly the first second-termer to try to reject it. With their last midterm elections behind them, two-term presidents are freed from some persistent political calculations and often exhibit a willingness to take bolder actions  even if it means sparking fresh dissent., President George W. Bush responded to his partys deep losses in the 2006 midterm by replacing his Defense secretary and pushing ahead with a surge of U.S. forces in Iraq, despite opposition from newly empowered Democrats and some in his own party. Similarly, President Reagan did not let opposition from hawks in his party or others dissuade him from pursuing major arms control agreements with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev., \"The last two years, he ended with a bang, not a whimper,\" said Reagan biographer Craig Shirley. He did note a difference between Obamas go-it-alone approach and Reagans efforts in the final years., \"Reagan never had control of the House; he always had to work with the Democrats to get things done,\" Shirley said., Obamas plan for a blitz of activity after the midterm election has long been in the works, advisors say. This summer, Chief of Staff Denis McDonough told senior staffers he wanted a series of important projects ready to roll out after the midterm  all designed to serve notice that Obama wasnt ready to go gently., Now, advisors say Obama is preparing for more action in the first few months of the year, although some will require cooperation from Republicans., The most likely target is a series of trade agreements, long a goal of the presidents that has more support from Republicans than Democrats. Other overlapping priorities are harder to find., White House aides list cybersecurity, reform of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, an overhaul of the patent system and infrastructure spending as potential areas of progress. Obama plans to raise the question of investing in early childhood education, which aides think some Republicans are warm to. College score cards and student loans are also on the docket for early in the year., Within the White House, there are varying degrees of optimism about the possibility of one big-ticket item likely to burnish the presidents legacy: tax reform., Though the prevailing view in the White House is that there is enough overlap between Republicans and Democrats to make it worth pursuing, veterans of fruitless battles with Congress are more skeptical., There may also be too much backlash from Obamas other executive moves to find the goodwill necessary to cut those deals., \"Thats a choice theyre going to make,\" said senior advisor Dan Pfeiffer. \"They can decide that theyre not going to do infrastructure because theyre angry about immigration or Cuba, but thats a loss for the country and probably for them. But what doesnt make sense is to not use the tools available to us to help improve the country.\", \"What were not going to do is wait for Congress,\" he said. \"Were going to push our agenda through.\", christi.parsons@latimes.com, kathleen.hennessey@latimes.com]", "Date": "20141221", "Title": "[Obama ends year with reminders that he's still not irrelevant]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-obama-relevance-20141221-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}

Sanders is an exceedingly long shot to win the Democratic nomination for president in 2016  not to mention the White House  should he run., But he speaks to a distinct strain of Democratic discontent, to liberals who view Hillary Rodham Clinton as too moderate, populists who see her as too wedded to Wall Street, doves who consider her too hawkish and Iowans who fret their state, which kicks off the presidential nominating process, will be ignored by the partys overwhelming front-runner., Many hoped Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the scourge of the financial industry, would challenge Clinton. But since she wont, some on the left have turned to Sanders, 73, a slouch-shouldered, self-described Democratic socialist who speaks with the vibrancy of an electric current and exhibits all the personal warmth of a snow bank., He will decide in a few weeks whether to run but wont seek, he insists, to undermine Clinton or split Democrats and elect a Republican president, the way independent Ralph Nader helped put George W. Bush in the White House., \"I will not play the role of spoiler,\" Sanders says., Nor would he wage a negative campaign, he says, suggesting he wouldnt even run against Clinton, per se: \"I run on the most important issues facing America.\", But Sanders has always been blunt, which wouldnt change just because some Democrats would prefer a bloodless coronation., More than once Sanders has questioned Clintons commitment to the middle class and those struggling to reach it. \"I dont think that is the politics of Sen. Clinton or the Democratic establishment,\" he told a college newspaper in Vermont. Hearing his words read back, Sanders cracks a rare smile., \"You can quote it,\" he says., ::, Bernie Sanders knows futility., Starting in 1971 he ran for office four times in five years, never getting more than 6% of the vote. (Vermont was once one of the most Republican states in the country.), He finally won a 1981 race for Burlington mayor, then lost campaigns for governor and Congress before winning Vermonts lone House seat. After eight terms, Sanders was elected to the Senate in 2006., \"Im not very smart,\" he tells the bookstore crowd. \"But Im persistent.\", Later, over coffee at an Iowa City diner, he was asked where that trait comes from. He responds curtly, \"I dont know.\", Perhaps it was his upbringing. His father, a penniless Polish immigrant whose family died in the Holocaust, sold paint for a living. The four-member Sanders family crowded a three-room apartment in the Flatbush area of Brooklyn, N.Y.; Bernie slept for a time in the living room, with his older brother., No one starved, but Sanders recalls the familys acquisitions were always \"at the low end of things.\" His mother died at 46, never realizing the dream of living in a house of their own., \"As a kid, I learned what a lack of money means to a family,\" Sanders said in a recent speech at the Brookings Institution. \"Thats a lesson I have never forgotten.\", He got his first taste of politics  and defeat  in high school, when he finished third in a three-way race for student body president. The winner did adopt one of his planks: raising scholarships for Korean orphans., After a year at Brooklyn College, Sanders attended the University of Chicago, where he was, by his own account, a middling student. He preferred his own course of study, reading Marx and Freud and helping organize sit-ins to protest the segregated campus housing., He spent several months after graduation living on an Israeli kibbutz, admiring the collective spirit, then moved to Vermont, lured by happy memories of Boy Scout camp and a travel brochure he saw as a kid., He scraped by for years in low-paying jobs, including working as a carpenter and freelance researcher. He divorced his college sweetheart and married a woman he met the night he was elected mayor. (The couple have four children and seven grandchildren.), The one constant was politics and  more often than not  rejection., When Sanders first went to Congress, Democrats wanted nothing to do with him. (He has run every race as a third-party candidate or independent.) It took intense negotiations for Sanders to win his first committee assignments., Since then, though, he has allied himself with congressional Democrats, who have embraced him in turn, and even worked across the aisle with Republicans on legislation targeting \"corporate welfare\" and caring for the nations veterans., Gradually he went from outsider and eccentric to something of a Vermont institution. \"Bernie fights for the little guy,\" says Garrison Nelson, a University of Vermont political scientist whos known Sanders for 40 years. \"That resonates very effectively in the state, because were little guys.\", In November, Sanders won reelection to the Senate with 71% of the vote., ::, If one of Clintons problems is persistent doubts about who she is and what she truly stands for, Sanders is all take it or leave it., Speaking to a largely student audience at the University of Iowa, the nights second stop, his clip-on microphone is pinned in a way that every word is muffled and every gesticulation rustles like a man crunching through a pile of dead leaves., He either doesnt know or doesnt care., His policy prescriptions are a throwback to the heydays of the New Deal and the Great Society: free college tuition, a $1-trillion program to rebuild the nations roads and bridges, government-run healthcare, higher taxes on the wealthy and publicly funded elections to chase rich donors out of politics. He would break up the nations big financial institutions and scrap trade agreements that he says have punished workers by shipping jobs overseas., All of it is delivered in a nasal Brooklynese that turns words like \"Iowa\" to \"Eye-uh-were\" and \"media\" to \"me-dee-uhr\" and in a string of admonishments: \"Listen to this!\" \"You got that?\" \"You follow what Im saying?\", Its a message that resonates with Democrats like Russ Gerst, 48, an accountant from Cedar Rapids who came to the universitys palatial business school to hear Sanders flay the countrys business leaders., He would like to see the senator run not because he thinks Sanders could win the nomination or become president but to force Clinton  too much the \"corporate Democrat,\" Gerst says  to take a stronger stance against Wall Street and the big banks, and to fight global warming by ending government subsidies for the oil and gas industries., He worries, though, that most voters wont get past the S-word  socialist  to hear what Sanders has to say., \"If you put out a paper and didnt know where it came from, a lot of people would shake their heads yes,\" Gerst says. \"But its hard if people shut their minds right away and dont want anything to do with listening.\", Sanders is undaunted. For all their urgent alarmism, his speeches always include a note of uplift, suggesting how the once improbable  a black president, female police officers, gay couples marrying  has become reality., \"The fight that we have now on the economic struggle, taking on the billionaire class  that is enormously difficult,\" he tells the crowd of about 75. \"But can it take place? Can we win that fight? We can. And we win it the old-fashioned way, when people stand up and fight back.\", The applause has barely died when Sanders is out the door into the 7-degree chill  no time for photos or chitchat., mark.barabak@latimes.com, Twitter: @markzbarabak]", "Date": "20150306", "Title": "[A Bernie Sanders presidential bid would take on the billionaires]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/la-na-c1-bernie-sanders-president-2016-20150306-story.html", "Author": "[Mark Z.

But until recently, a fiery liberal like him would have had considerable difficulty creating a durable campaign operation out of the large groups of peaceniks, environmentalists and college professors turning out to see him in liberal towns like Madison, Wis., and Iowa City, Iowa., Now, off-the-shelf technology is available to build detailed profiles of the thousands who come to rallies and use the data to find many thousands more just like them in early-voting states. Sanders staff can tap into a massive voter file the Democratic National Committee makes available to candidates to pinpoint with precision which people who show up at a rally are prospective precinct captains in Iowa., And instead of a balky, in-house online fundraising tool, Sanders can lean on the transformative liberal fundraising website ActBlue. Thousands of Sanders enthusiasts are playing the role of microbundler, enticing their friends to the Web page where making donations is as intuitive and addicting as shopping on Amazon., Most of these tools were not available until recently, at least not at a price affordable to a grass-roots candidate like Sanders, who disavows corporate money and refuses to launch a \"super PAC.\", We were trying to do this with bubble gum and Scotch tape, said Joe Trippi, who managed the Dean campaign. There is a Ferrari out there now for Bernie Sanders to use. He is doing well with it and can do even more than he has been. It can go even faster and a lot further. We will see where he takes it., Trippi cautions, though, that technology will only get Sanders so far. Like other strategists, he says the appeal of the democratic socialist drops off considerably once he is no longer competing in parts of the country where primary voters share the demographic profile of those in his home state, Vermont  overwhelmingly white, very liberal and older., Still, only weeks ago, there was little talk that Sanders could actually win in New Hampshire or Iowa or both. Now victory in those states is at least conceivable, particularly after about 250,000 mostly small-dollar donors sent the Sanders campaign $15 million during his first quarter as a candidate, an amount that far exceeded the expectations of operatives in Washington., Sanders staff is cagey about particular technologies they are using. But unlike the days of Dean, when the software had to be created on the fly, progressives now have a deep pool of experienced political data-miners from which to draw., The techies working for Sanders are veterans of President Obamas wildly successful digital team. Among them is Scott Goodstein, who was external director for Obama 08., We were looking for a candidate ... who could inspire a movement, he said in a statement., Sanders may be no techie, but the gruff independent with the thick Brooklyn accent has a cult of personality that spawns clicks., In a campaign where strategists are competing with one another to come up with the most clever 404 error page  the page that comes up when you hit on a bad link within a website  Sanders bested his rivals with a video message that mocks his Internet aptitude., Standing awkwardly before the camera in an unfashionable suit and tie, speaking too loudly and with the cadence of a grandparent trying to explain something extremely important and complicated, Sanders directs visitors on how to use the website. Swiping a meaty hand in front of the camera, he says, Just scoot down to the bottom of the page and you will find your way back home to where you should be., The Vermonters success at harnessing social media defies convention., What we do not do, the senator said, is say, Hi, I walked my dog this morning. What a beautiful day. And then tweet it out. Not even close. Sanders writes detailed ideas about such concepts as Americas grotesque level of income inequality and the moral responsibility we must accept to transform our energy system, and his people push it out to his growing mass of followers., In some cases, we will quote other people, Sanders said. Like the pope. I am a big fan of the pope., Digital strategists have seen this before., Howard Dean was thought of as a conservative Democrat who did not know much about the Internet, said John Hagner, a partner at the tech firm Clarity Campaign Labs in Washington and a veteran of the Dean campaign. People who had a lot of technical sense opposed the Iraq war, and they liked what he was saying.

While the amount is dwarfed by the $45 million raised by Democratic frontrunner Hillary Rodham Clinton, it is substantially more thanSandershad been expected to raise and reflects the growing strength of his candidacy., The Sanders fundraising haul comes as polls show him continuing to cut into Clintons lead in the polls. A new survey from Quinnipiac University has Clinton 20 points ahead of Sanders in Iowa. Its a formidable gap, but much smaller than the 45-point lead Clinton hadin Iowa in the same poll in May. Sanders is also gaining ground in New Hampshire, and a rally Sanders held Wednesday night in Madison, Wis.,drew more people than any event Clinton has held so far. The Associated Press estimated the attendance at 10,000., The quarterly fundraising figures the Sanders campaign released Thursdayare typically used as a guide to measure enthusiasm for a candidate. In his case, they confirm his support is broad. The Clinton camp would not say how many individual donors gave to her, a figure that will be available in the federal report the campaigns must file by July 15., The $45 million Clinton raised, though, represents only part of whathascome in for her. Clinton supporters are also raising money from wealthy donors separately, through the Priorities USA \"super PAC.\" There is no limit to what donors can contribute to the group, unlike official campaign funds, which can accept no more than $2,700 per individual.

{"Content": "[[, Bernie Sanders, one of Vermonts U.S. senators, is mulling a 2016 run for president, as either a Democrat or independent. He is expected to announce his decision in a few weeks., During a recent testing-the-waters swing through Iowa, the self-described Democratic socialist --elected as an independent -- sat down for a 45-minute interview at Iowa Citys Bluebird Diner., Here are selected excerpts:, Q: Setting aside political labels, how would you describe yourself and your political philosophy?, A: Setting aside labels, I am somebody who believes that government in a democratic society should be representing the needs of the vast majority of the people who are middle-class and working families. That at the current point, we are living in a society which is moving more and more toward an oligarchic form of society where government is dominated heavily by big-money interests., Q: When did you first have the notion of running for president? What set off thatlight bulb in your head?, A: About a year ago....The light bulb going off in my head was a fear that in this pivotal moment in history, when this country faces so many serious problems, when the middle class and working class of this country are being decimated, that there were not voices out there representing the tens of millions of people who needed a voice. And the idea of going through a campaign where there is not a serious discussion about the most important issues facing America, where there are not voices out there representing people who are hurting -- that seemed to me unacceptable.\", Q: You have almost a physical aversion to discussing yourself and answering personal questions. Why is that?, A: I think that the media spends far too much time [on personalities]. Ill give you an example. Im not going to tell you I know George W. Bush intimately. Im not going to tell you were best friends. Ill tell you I met him on a number of occasions. You know what? George W. Bush is a very nice guy. Very funny guy. His wife is a very nice woman; I thought she was a great first lady.George [W.] Bush was the worst president in the history of the United States of America.... The issue is not Bernie Sanders. The issue is the Koch brothers. The issue is who owns America., Q: If you choose to run against the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Rodham Clinton, how do you distinguish yourself and draw contrasts?, A:I dont run against Hillary Clinton. I run on the most important issues facing America. I state my views. And if Hillary Clinton runs, Im sure she will state her views. And if she runs and if I run, there will be a contrast of views.... I dont believe in trashing my opponents. Ive never run a negative ad in my life. I believe in talking about issues, sometimes fighting for the media to talk about the issues, but thats what I do, and the people will decide., Q: What do you think of the continued focus on Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and efforts to coax her into the Democratic race despite her statements she wont run in 2016?, A: Elizabeth is a good friend of mine. Elizabeth came up [to Vermont] to do a number of town meetings before she was elected to the Senate, when she was at Harvard, and I think she is doing a great job., Q: Would you like to see her run for president?, A: Would I like to see Elizabeth run? Talk to Elizabeth, its not my business., Q: So whats your thought process? When do you make a decision?, A: Obviously the clock is ticking. You have primaries at a certain date. But I think we have time. For me, the determination is, can we put together the kind of grass-roots organization that we need and can we raise the kind of money that we need, and thats what Im trying to determine., Q: Short of winning the White House, short of winning the Democratic nomination, how would you measure success?, A: The truth is that political consciousness in this country is pretty low.... To the degree that we can help educate and organize people around the most important issues facing their lives and show that there is support for fundamental changes in the way we do business in the United States of America in terms of income inequality, in terms of low wages, in terms of disastrous trade policies, in terms of being the only major country not to have a national healthcare program -- thats success., Q: So if you run, its with the intention of injecting your agenda into the campaign?, A: If I run -- thats a big if -- the goal is to win the election, no ifs, buts or maybes. What I would say to the establishment is that there is far more discontent among the American people than they believe. The question that I have got to ask myself -- what were wrestling with right now -- is can you put together that grass-roots mobilization, can you get the volunteers that you need, can you raise the significant number of small donations that you need to run an effective campaign?, Q: What kind of odds would you give yourself of winning?, A: Were the underdog. No ifs, buts or maybes., Q: If you fall short but push others to embrace your views, would that constitute success?, A: The answer is, the people push somebody. If we can create a climate among people that says that any serious candidate for president, Senate, governor, [the] House is going to have to talk about income inequality, raising wages in this country, trade policy -- thats a huge success. Its not putting pressure on a candidate. Its mobilizing people., Q: You repeatedly mention your opposition to the war in Iraq. If you run, do you plan to relitigate that issue?, A: Its not a question of relitigating it. It was a long time ago. It was a terrible mistake. So the issue, I think, is not to relitigate. The issue, which is a very, very tough issue, is where do we go from here given the situation.... I am very, very, very concerned about the United States getting drawn into an endless war, year after year after year., Q: As you doubtless know, Hillary Clinton supported going to war in Iraq, and that was a big issue in the 2008 presidential campaign. Is her support something voters should consider in 2016?, A: I think the war in the Mideast, how we got into it and how were going to address the current problems, are issues that every American should be concerned about., Q: Should I follow @markzbarabak for coverage of national and California politics?

{"Content": "[[, Bernie Sanders, the socialist-leaning senator from Vermont, raised an accurate and depressing point recently about the Koch brothers efforts to expand their de facto new political party of the 1% by pledging to spend $889 million in the next federal election cycle. It is, of course, an outrageous move, though entirely legal under recent Supreme Court decisions that give the rich a bigger bullhorn than the rest of us., Progressives fumed and social media trilled with the usual ineffectual outrage, but the story quickly faded. And that could well be the biggest problem: A cynicism-weighted apathy by voters whose only faith in the political process is that it will be gamed by the wealthy., The anger is there, Sanders told The Washington Post, but its an anger that turns into saying, Go to hell, Im not going to participate in your charade. Im not voting. So its a weird kind of anger. Its not people getting out in the streets.... Were at the stage of demoralization., That about sums it up. We tend to focus on the left-right divide in politics but the deeper threat to a functioning democracy is the numbers who stay out of the process completely. That leaves it to the passionate, and the rich. We are a democracy of the few, not a democracy of the many., As the Post reported in another piece, the $889 million comes close to the $1 billion that each of the two major parties presidential nominees are expected to spend in 2016, and it cements the networks standing as one of the countrys most potent political forces. With its resources and capabilities -- including a national field operation and cutting-edge technology -- it is challenging the primacy of the official parties., So with the Koch brothers Freedom Partners (technically a tax-exempt business lobbying group that promotes the benefits of free markets and a free society), we get a third political party -- just not the kind many people, left or right, might have anticipated emerging., And not the kind that will help improve Americans sense that the political system, and the government, works. A recent survey from Suffolk University found a majority \"expressed dissatisfaction with the two-party system\" while 32% favored a potential third party. And an earlier Suffolk University/USA Today poll taken just before the 2012 presidential election found that while 8 in 10 believethe government plays an important role in their lives (it didnt ask whether that was good or bad), tens of millions of eligible voters dont bother to cast ballots., \"The long-term trend tends to be awful,\" Curtis Gans, director of the non-partisan Center for the Study of the American Electorate, told USA Todayin the lead up to the last presidential election.\"Theres a lot of lack of trust in our leaders, a lack of positive feelings about political institutions, a lack of quality education for large segments of the public, a lack of civic education, the fragmenting effects of waves of communications technology, the cynicism of the coverage of politics -- I could go on with a long litany.\", This is where the real political crisis resides, and what makes it so easy for powerful interests to prevail.

{"Content": "[[, Billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer is aggressively exploring a run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Barbara Boxer and is expected to make a decision within days, according to multiple sources close to Steyer., The former hedge fund titan has been huddling with advisors, polling California voters, buying website addresses and meeting with political and labor leaders as he weighs a bid, the sources said., Boxers announcement Thursday that she would leave her post in 2016 set off a frenzy of speculation about who would run for the first open U.S. Senate seat in California in more than 20 years. If Steyer opts in, with the ability to fund a race expected to cost tens of millions of dollars, he could upend a field that would otherwise be crowded with other ambitious Democrats., \"Steyer has the greatest incentive to plant his flag early,\" said Dan Schnur, head of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC. He \"has the capacity to scare other people out of the race.\", But California has a political graveyard full of neophyte millionaires and billionaires who spent large chunks of their fortunes only to be rejected by voters. Among them: former business executives Meg Whitman, Carly Fiorina, Al Checchi, Michael Huffington and Bill Simon., \"Theres a first time for everything. But California voters have not historically looked very kindly on first-time self-financing candidates,\" said Democratic operative Garry South, who led former Gov. Gray Davis to victory over Checchi in the Democratic primary in 1998, and over Simon in the general election in 2002., South said wealthy but inexperienced candidates tended to have three critical flaws  free-spending but unfocused campaigns, large and undisciplined staffs and a lack of respect for people with professional experience in politics., \"They think that because theyre worth a billion dollars, theyre basically better than everybody else in the political system,\" South said. \"Their disdain for people in the process is just obvious, and it makes them make a lot of mistakes.\", Steyer, a San Franciscan whose wealth is estimated at $1.6 billion, has had both successes and failures in electoral politics., He was the nations biggest individual donor in the 2014 elections, spending more than $74 million on congressional and gubernatorial contests across the nation and pledging to make climate change a top issue in hotly contested races., Candidates backed by Steyer and his organization, NextGen Climate, won races for U.S. Senate in Michigan and New Hampshire; governor in Pennsylvania and some state legislatures. But they lost Senate contests in Colorado and Iowa, and governors races in Florida and Maine., In California, Steyer successfully spent millions fighting a 2010 ballot measure that would have rolled back the states landmark climate change law. In 2012, he backed a voter-approved proposition to close a loophole that allowed multistate companies to pay out-of-state taxes., Steyer left Farallon Capital Management, the hedge fund he ran, in 2012, saying he wanted to focus his work on alternative energy. As he became increasingly engaged in politics, his business record has come under growing scrutiny., News reports detailed his longtime investments in coal and other fossil fuels, for example, and the slow pace at which he shed those investments., Farallon Capital Management pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into companies running coal mines and coal-fired power plants overseas, the New York Times reported. The fund was profiting from mining companies that produced more coal each year than the entire amount of coal consumed annually by Britain., The inquiries would surely magnify if he launched a Senate run; opponents would scour his two-decade hedge-fund history for vulnerabilities to exploit. Deals that seem routine in the world of finance can be poisonous in politics. GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney was portrayed as a corporate scoundrel in 2012., Steyers polling, conducted in late December, found another obstacle  few people had heard of him. But that could be easily remedied with advertising., In addition to veteran Democratic pollster Paul Maslin, Steyer is also working with Jim Margolis, who was President Obamas media strategist, and Chris Lehane, a longtime adviser to President Clinton., Steyer has begun purchasing \"Steyer for Senate\" websites and planned to meet with advisors at his home this weekend., Steyers moves are expected to narrow the window for other candidates to make their own announcements, given that anyone hoping to compete with him needs to start raising funds immediately., California Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom remain the most widely discussed as candidates to replace Boxer, and they have been the most secretive about their plans. Advisors to both, who dont want to see them run against one another, were silent about their decision-making processes or timelines., Meanwhile, other potential candidates, such as Democratic Reps. John Garamendi, Loretta Sanchez and Jackie Speier, are increasingly vocal about exploring a bid. On Saturday, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa broke his silence, issuing a statement confirming that he may run., As for Steyer, \"The daunting fact for anyone else is, Oh my gosh, he can come in and potentially dominate in terms of communications \" with voters, said a source who requested anonymity because he could not openly discuss Steyers affairs., Times staff writer Evan Halper in Washington contributed to this report., Twitter: @LATSeema, @finneganLAT, 9:58 a.m. Jan. 10: This post has been updated to reflect former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigoss announcement that he may run for Sen.

{"Content": "[[, Boosted by their November election gains, congressional Republicans have launched a new effort to weaken, bit by bit, a law that dramatically expanded federal oversight of the financial system after the Great Recession., On Wednesday, the Republican-controlled House is expected to pass a package of bills making changes to the 2010 law, known as Dodd-Frank, which also created a powerful new agency to protect consumers., The law was enacted over nearly unanimous opposition from Republican lawmakers. Many despise Dodd-Frank almost as much as they do Obamacare because they believe its an overreaction to the 2008 financial crisis and an unnecessary burden on business., Now that Republicans have a Senate majority too, Democrats will have more difficulty stopping attempts to chip away at the laws hundreds of regulations, though President Obamas veto pen still looms in the White House., \"The truth is Dodd-Frank was not chiseled in stone. Nobody brought it down to us from Mt. Sinai,\" said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), who is leading the effort to change the law. \"Congress would be negligent in its duties if we did not continually monitor and fix Dodd-Franks unintended consequences.\", In the last few weeks, Republicans watered down key parts of Dodd-Frank by attaching provisions to so-called must-pass bills  one funding most of the federal government and another reauthorizing an important terrorism risk insurance program that had expired. Obama signed the bills despite his opposition to their changes in Dodd-Frank., The maneuver provided an early road map to how the new Republican-controlled Congress might try to make long-sought changes to financial regulations over Obamas objections., Liberal Democrats, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), are rallying to stop the effort., They nearly derailed the government funding bill last month because it contained a provision that eased Dodd-Frank restrictions on bank trading of financial derivatives  the type of complex investments that helped trigger the financial crisis., Liberals anti-Wall Street fervor was highlighted this week when investment banker Antonio Weiss withdrew his nomination to a senior Treasury Department position because of opposition from Warren and others who objected to his Wall Street background., \"Weve already seen that the new Republican Congress is going to aggressively attack the Dodd-Frank act,\" said Warren, who was an outspoken advocate for the legislation. She launched the laws Consumer Financial Protection Bureau before winning a Senate seat in 2012., \"The risk of another financial crisis remains too high, and we should be strengthening financial reforms, not rolling them back to benefit Wall Street,\" she said., The proposed changes before the House now include a controversial two-year delay in implementing part of the so-called Volcker Rule, which bars banks from making risky investments. The changes are necessary, supporters say, to avoid saddling businesses with heavy-handed regulations., The White House said Obama would veto the bill because \"the administration has strong concerns with any provisions that would weaken key consumer and investor protections and elements of financial oversight.\", Most Democrats have vowed to keep the law intact., \"We have seen this movie before,\" said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). \"We will keep seeing it over and over again.\", But some changes are needed, said Francis Creighton, executive vice president of government affairs at the Financial Services Roundtable, an industry trade group. He argued that Democrats are overreacting to sensible and relatively small-scale fixes., \"Sometimes were trying to do things that will actually make the system work better,\" he said. \"Were not always twisting our mustache, doing this villainously.\", The delay in the Volcker Rule, for instance, is necessary to avoid pushing banks into getting rid of some assets in a \"fire sale\" fashion, Creighton said. The legislation in the House would extend an existing delay in implementing the rule to 2019 from 2017., Republicans note some of the Dodd-Frank changes have bipartisan support., The legislation that includes the Volcker Rule delay, called the Promoting Job Growth and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act, garnered 35 Democratic votes last week when Republicans unsuccessfully tried to pass it in an expedited procedure that required a two-thirds vote., The focus liberals have put on changes to Dodd-Frank in recent weeks has made it tougher for Democrats to support the Republicans, said former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.)., \"Ive talked more about the bill in the last couple of months than in years, and thats a good thing,\" said Frank, who led the effort to pass it in the House in 2010. \"Its now become a national issue again and Im very confident the public will become very angry\" if Republicans continue to attack it., The biggest mistake Republicans could make would be to try to weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is popular with the public, Frank said., The bureau has a director, who is appointed by the president to a five-year term, and is funded directly by the Federal Reserve, which means Congress cant cut its budget., Republicans complain the agency is too powerful and want to replace the director with a five-member commission and subject its funding to the congressional appropriations process. The House has approved legislation in the past to make those changes, but the bills have died in the Senate., Its unclear whether Senate Republicans now will be able to pass Dodd-Frank changes. If they do, Obama will veto them, said Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew., Republicans could then try to force Obamas hand by including the changes in must-pass bills. Last week, for instance, they added to the terrorism risk insurance bill a provision to exempt agricultural and energy companies from requirements to post collateral when trading derivatives., Warren and other supporters of Dodd-Frank have called such maneuvers legislative hostage-taking., \"If we fail to challenge this cynical strategy now, it will only encourage Republicans to pull our financial regulations apart piece by piece,\" Warren told her colleagues last week.

{"Content": "[[, Both major political parties and groups of their deep-pocketed supporters are playing big in the handful of fiercely fought congressional races in California this year., With Republicans widely expected to keep  even add to  their House majority in November, the interest from national groups appears to be all about future elections. The parties are positioning themselves for 2016, when the nation will next elect a president and when the political climate could be very different, and even beyond to 2018, experts said., \"Republicans want a cushion against the risk of future losses,\" said John J. \"Jack\" Pitney Jr., a Claremont McKenna College political scientist and former GOP official. \"Democrats want to limit GOP gains this year so that they will be in a better starting position for when their prospects are brighter.\", As a result, tough battles have developed in half a dozen districts. In four of those, Democrats, buoyed by strong turnout for President Obama, wrested the seats from Republicans in 2012., Another is in the Central Valley, where Democrats hope Amanda Renteria, a local native who has worked in Washington, can dislodge Rep. David Valadao (R-Hanford) from the seat he won that year., The other is in the Inland Empire, where the parties are fighting it out over who will succeed retiring Rep. Gary Miller (R-Rancho Cucamonga) in a Democrat-tilting district., The closest contests are widely believed to be those involving three first-term Democrats., In Northern California, Rep. Ami Bera of Elk Grove faces former Republican Rep. Doug Ose of Sacramento., In Southern California, Republicans recruited Assemblyman Jeff Gorell of Camarillo to take on Rep. Julia Brownley of Westlake Village, and former San Diego City Councilman Carl DeMaio, seen by some as a rising GOP star, is challenging Rep. Scott Peters of San Diego., The nonpartisan Cook Political Report labels each of the three contests a toss-up. Cook gives a slight edge to the fourth Democratic freshman, Rep. Raul Ruiz of Palm Desert, opposed by GOP Assemblyman Brian Nestande, also of Palm Desert, but concludes the Central Valley district probably will stay in the Republican column., The fierce competition is fanned by spending by groups that are not part of the candidates own campaigns. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has so far spent roughly $3 million against DeMaio, Gorell and Ose, according to campaign reports filed with the government., Another Democratic group, House Majority PAC, has pumped almost half a million dollars into efforts to defeat Gorell and Ose., The National Republican Congressional Committee reported spending about $1.5 million to oppose Bera and Peters., Other groups involved in some of these races include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has spent about $600,000 to support Ose and Valadao and more than $300,000 to oppose Bera., Likewise, Defending Main Street SuperPAC Inc., which supports incumbent Republicans, spent $100,000 for Ose and $29,000 for Valadao., With a month to go until election day, other interests have signaled theyll get involved, including the conservative American Action Network, which has reserved television advertising time., Some of the strongest attacks have surfaced in the Peters and Brownley races., In San Diego, the National Republican Congressional Committee launched a TV ad last week implying that Peters had used his position in Congress to engage in insider trading, a federal felony. The Peters campaign called the ad \"a false, egregious and purely political attack\" that its lawyers were working to have taken down., The local ABC affiliate, 10 News, and its Civility Project, which analyzes political advertising, called it \"outrageous\" and gave it an \"F\" grade., The Brownley camp has invested heavily in trying to knock down Gorells record as a work-across-the-aisle moderate in a district where Democrats hold a slim registration edge., No sooner had Gorell disavowed the tea party as \"too extreme\" than Brownley supporters dug up a 2009 YouTube video showing him addressing the ultra-conservative group at a rally with a tea bag around his neck., Gorell cited an analysis by the nonpartisan Sunlight Foundation that reviewed voting records and showed him to be one of the most moderate members of the state Legislature. He predicted his record, his military service in a district flush with veterans and his strong local ties would win the day., \"Im going to prove that you can win a congressional seat in this part of the state by running a positive campaign,\" Gorell said., On Thursday, the Brownley campaign issued a news release portraying Gorell as anti-immigrant, noting, among other things, that he had once defended Proposition 187, the controversial 1994 ballot measure intended to deny most public services to those in the country illegally., Gorell strategist Reed Galen said his clients record shows he is \"staunchly in favor of comprehensive immigration reform.\" Brownley and her allies \"have spent millions distorting Gorells record to avoid having to talk about her own,\" Galen said., Brownley and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee have said she is more in line with district voters on most issues, including healthcare access and womens rights., Longtime Democratic strategist Darry A. Sragow said it was no accident that many of the Democratic campaigns in competitive districts this year are trying to brand their Republican opponents as tea party candidates., In the past, social issues such as abortion and the death penalty were used to mobilize voters, Sragow said. Today, its the tea party., \"To a lot of voters, especially Democratic voters,\" Sragow said, \" tea party is a pejorative.\", Not all candidates are running in the middle. Republican Iraq War veteran and business owner Paul Chabot is competing with Redlands Mayor Pete Aguilar for an Inland Empire seat that most analysts say offers Democrats their best chance for a pickup this year.

{"Content": "[[, Bruce Bartlett has 24-karat conservative credentials. He worked in the Reagan White House, the George H.W. Bush Treasury Department, for former Texas Rep. Ron Paul and the Heritage Foundation. So when he saw Republicans doing things he believed damaged the brand, he said so, and was surprised to find himself first ignored, then struck from the rolls of the GOP talk-ocracy, and even fired from his think tank job. And that, he says, is the problem. Bartlett, who is now an independent, made headlines recently with a scholarly paper about Fox News. In it, he describes a media \"bubble\" that imperils the GOP by screening out ideas that challenge Republican orthodoxy  in other words, those inconvenient truths., What was the genesis of the Fox paper?, In 2004, I was extensively quoted in a New York Times magazine article [critical of President George W. Bushs decision-making]. I assumed my conservative friends would give me a lot of trouble, but nobody said a word. I finally started asking, \"What did you think?\" Every single one gave me the same answer: \"I dont read the New York Times.\" Many were mildly insulted that I would think they would read what from their point of view was the equivalent of Pravda., This was the first indication I had of the bubble conservatives now live in. The fact that they would consciously close themselves off to this key source of information came as a revelation. Its gotten much worse in the last 10 years as conservative media have become more available; Fox is just the biggest. Inside the bubble, certain facts are never heard because theyre inconvenient to the conservative worldview. Global warming is probably the biggest but hardly the only one., Youre no longer a Republican yet youre concerned that bubble-think could damage GOP electability., A lot of conservatives are a bit worried about this. They understand this isnt good for the party. Its going to hurt us in 2016 because if we have people who are not serious candidates, making ridiculous arguments about Obamas invasion of Texas and other crackpot issues, all Hillary has to do is nothing., Yet Republicans control Congress and many state legislatures, so how is this bubble damaging the GOP?, [For example,] the 2012 drumbeat on Fox that polls showing [Mitt] Romney losing were wrong; this was considered gospel in the conservative world: \"Of course Romney is ahead because our ideas are so popular.\" To the extent that it affected Republican strategy, they may have deluded themselves into a defeat. If you think your guy is behind, you work a little harder., A Kentucky state GOP senator told a legislative hearing, \"We all agree that the temperature on Mars is exactly as it is here.\" But Mars is much colder than Earth. What happened to being entitled to your own opinions but not your own facts?, This is a severe problem for democracy itself. We cant go back to the old days of half-hour news broadcasts on the three major networks, when people were forced to have a common source of information, at least on a few issues. [Now] its a rare day that somebody doesnt go into business with some new conservative news site. These people are good at worming their way into the system. There seems to be a kind of nonaggression pact among non-bubble media not to say the emperor is wearing no clothes  that Fox is not a legitimate news source, its a propaganda source., What do you think is Foxs end game?, So far they have not been confronted by any contradiction between their support for a conservative worldview and making money and getting ratings. They tell themselves nobody is forced to watch; that if someone wants a different point of view, all they have to do is change the channel., The path for Republican presidential hopefuls seems to run through Fox., I think thats right. One consequence [is] the huge number of candidates. Historically, the way the Republican Party has operated, theres one guy that everybody agrees: \"Its your turn.\" That was true for [John] McCain, for Romney, for Bob Dole before that. Now its easy for [candidates] to overcome the threshold of name ID because theres so much conservative media out there that they will legitimize candidates for their own purpose of gaining audiences. In the old days, the news media had a winnowing effect that prevented crackpots and people with no chance from getting any traction., Many of these candidates have very close connections to Fox News. [Mike] Huckabee had a show for years, building his audience and in the process building an organization for his campaign., Nobody in his right mind would defend child sexual molestation unless theyre so deep in the bubble that the first reaction is, I have to defend these people because theyre part of my constituency. That Huckabee would do something like that [Huckabee defended the repentance of reality show personality Josh Duggar, who has admitted to wrongdoing related to molestation \"mistakes\" he made as a teenager] seems patently absurd, without reference to the bubble., How has Fox news changed since it started in 1996?, Right after 9/11, whether it was market-driven or ideological, Fox made a decision to move further to the right. When Fox first came on the air, they were to the right of most other major media by virtue of being in the center because the others tilted a bit to the left. They could honestly say, \"Were fair and balanced.\" Fox moved to the right at a time the whole country moved to the right. One commentator said [that] in many ways Fox is not so much conservative as it is anti-liberal., [Fox News Chairman and Chief Executive] Roger Ailes cut his teeth during the Nixon years. Remember the \"silent majority\" and the hard-hats? A lot of this is simply hippie-bashing brought up to the modern era; Ailes is smart enough to redefine that generational cultural debate and keep it relevant., Theres a study in the Journal of Public Economics that suggests its possible to track Foxs effect on voters., Fox had to go through a long process of getting [local] cable systems to carry Fox News. You can study when a particular cable system made Fox available, by the exact date, and you can look at voting data before and after by congressional district. Its a wonderful data source for all kinds of phenomena. You can see it increased votes for Republican candidates and for Republican policies in Congress., You used the term \"self-brainwashing\" to describe how the bubble affects policymaking., [Here are] two examples: One is Benghazi, an issue about which nobody outside the Fox universe cares. Yet [congressional] Republicans keep holding one investigation after another, and when their investigation proves theres nothing wrong, they ignore it and start a new investigation. The other is the obsession with Obamacare. Fox has given forums to Obamacares critics to a far greater extent than other media., Congress is up to, what, 60 votes to repeal this thing? Now it looks like the dog may have caught the bus; if the Supreme Court gives the Republicans what they want, this could be a complete disaster for them., To what extent has President Obama himself become the fuel for conservative obsessions?, I hate to play up the race angle, but I dont see how you can avoid it. Republican conservatives deny Obamas legitimacy: Thats the basis for this thing about his birth certificate. In a poll after the 2012 election, 58% of Republicans said the election was stolen. I dont want to make too much of a sociological argument, but this does date back historically to the denial of humanity to slaves because the only way whites could rationalize treating them as slaves was to deny theyre actual human beings., What other changes have Fox wrought on the GOP?, The key thing is the development of the tea party in 2009, which I dont really view as conservative but as populist. A member of Congress who may be genuinely moderate doesnt dare vote [that way] for fear he will be attacked [from the right]; they have no choice but to do what the tea party wants. [They] need a real-time fix on what issues animate the tea party. Where are you going to get that? Very easy  you turn on Fox News., Do Democrats have a bubble too?, There are people who only watch MSNBC or [listen to] Stephanie Miller, but thats a very small number compared to people [in the bubble] on the right. Pew [Research Center] polling data [shows] Democrats get their news from more varied sources. A lot of the Democratic coalition are not really liberal, theyre good-government people, they want government to work; whereas vast numbers of Republicans are essentially operational anarchists  they hate government, they use every opportunity to destroy government, because in their warped view that is per se good., [In the conservative bubble] you never find anyone willing to say government does something right unless youre talking about killing Muslims. You only hear about government screw-ups; you never hear about corporate screw-ups. So theres an imbalance that gets back to echo-chamber brainwashing. When government does something right, its simply not reported; that leads people to think, we might as well get rid of government or slash it willy-nilly., This interview has been condensed and edited. patt.morrison@latimes.com, Twitter: @pattmlatimes, Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinionandFacebook]", "Date": "20150603", "Title": "[ Can Bruce Bartlett save the GOP by bursting its 'bubble'?]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-morrison-bartlett-20150603-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, Buried in debt, Centinela hospital of Inglewood was on the verge of bankruptcy in 2007. It had lost $50 million in four years, and local officials worried that it might close  following the path of several other South Los Angeles hospitals., But where others saw risk, cardiologist Prem Reddy saw opportunity., Reddys company, Prime Healthcare Services Inc., bought Centinela and quickly turned it around, cutting expenses and increasing revenue. Centinela lost $63 million in 2007. Six years later, it made $39 million. Today its rated among the better-performing hospitals in the state., The Ontario company has followed the same model over and again, growing from a single hospital in 2001 to the 30 it now operates in nine states., Reddy has become one of the most powerful  and polarizing  figures in healthcare. Critics say he reduces important but unprofitable services. Supporters say hes rescued hospitals that otherwise would have failed, improved services and provided an impressive amount of care to indigent patients., In his boldest move yet, Reddy is now trying buy a chain of six nonprofit Catholic hospitals across California, including St. Francis and St. Vincent medical centers in Los Angeles County. Acquiring the Daughters of Charity Health System hospitals, which are also on the verge of bankruptcy, would be a major step for his growing company., But the $843-million deal needs the blessing of California Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, who must approve sales of nonprofit hospitals. The deals biggest opponent is a union that was among her biggest political contributors in her 2010 and 2014 campaigns. As Harris campaigns for Barbara Boxers U.S. Senate seat, she is likely to need union votes and money., A decision is expected by Feb. 20., \"Saving these six hospitals is very dear to me,\" Reddy told The Times. \"I hope and pray the attorney general looks into what went into this decision-making process and, more importantly, what will be the consequences if she denies this: Six hospitals will go into bankruptcy.\", In Prime Healthcares early years, Reddy was attacked for his ruthless drive to cut costs. He canceled contracts with insurance companies and used emergency rooms to replace lost revenue. He was repeatedly accused of trying to avoid caring for those unable to pay, allegations that he strongly denied., In a lawsuit, Kaiser Permanente contended that Prime Healthcare hospitals needlessly admitted emergency room patients, rather than transfer them to Kaiser facilities. Reddy denies wrongdoing, and his company is suing Kaiser for tens of millions of dollars in unpaid bills. Both lawsuits are pending., Reddy was arrested in 1999 and charged with threatening a doctor at a San Bernardino County hospital, but the case was dismissed after the doctor recanted his allegations. A judge later declared Reddy factually innocent., The chains biggest adversary has been the SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West, a union that represents about 150,000 healthcare workers in California, including about 2,600 at the Daughters of Charity hospitals. The group has run a five-year, highly public campaign aimed at exposing alleged violations by Prime Healthcare., Among the more serious allegations: Prime has been accused of overbilling Medicare, the subject of an ongoing Justice Department investigation. The company also paid $275,000 in 2013 to resolve a federal investigation into the improper release of a patients records., In 2011, the union helped persuade Harris to reject Prime Healthcare Foundations proposed purchase of Victor Valley Community Hospital in Victorville. The sale was \"not in the public interest and will likely create a significant effect on the availability or accessibility of healthcare services to the affected community,\" she said. In all, the attorney generals office has approved two past purchases by Prime and rejected two others., The unions research helped spur an ongoing Justice Department investigation of Prime Healthcares billing practices. It has issued dozens of news releases critical of the hospital company and built a coalition of state and federal lawmakers opposing the proposed Daughters of Charity sale., \"Their entire strategy is based on extracting as much money as possible,\" said Dave Regan, president of the SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West. \"I just think this is a company thats bad for healthcare, bad for patients.\", Despite the unions campaign, many in the healthcare industry say Reddy has learned to play nice, to his companys benefit. The California Nurses Assn., for instance, supports the Daughters of Charity sale to Prime Healthcare., Robert Issai, chief executive of the Daughters of Charity chain, said Reddy  and his companys track record  won him over. In his yearlong effort to find a buyer, Issai said he reached out to more than 100 potential buyers and received six offers for the system before picking Prime., \"The Prime Healthcare of six years ago is different than Prime Healthcare today,\" Issai said. \"I think what motivates [Reddy] is to make a difference. He goes after hospitals that are almost in bankruptcy. He takes that as a challenge and he feels pretty good about himself that he was able to save these hospitals.\", Issai said the Daughters of Charity board chose the chain because it promised to assume more than $300 million in pension liability and keep the hospitals open for at least five years, while keeping most of its 7,600 employees., As Prime Healthcare grew, Reddy was able to negotiate favorable contracts with the biggest names in health insurance: Aetna, Blue Cross, Blue Shield, UnitedHealthcare, Health Net. Many of them have contracts at all 30 Prime Healthcare hospitals., \"Its not that our business philosophy changed, its that we became so big  the health plans started recognizing and having to deal with us,\" he said., The Prime Healthcare hospitals have received numerous honors for their quality of care. Last year, the Leapfrog Group, a nonprofit that rates hospital safety, gave the Prime Healthcare hospitals in California an average safety score that exceeded the statewide average., Steve Valentine, a healthcare finance consultant and president of the Camden Group in El Segundo, said Reddy used an unusual approach to building his company in the early days., His hardball approach alienated labor unions, insurers and patients who ended up with high out-of-pocket costs, Valentine said., \"But much to Prime Healthcares credit, they took hospitals that otherwise were going to go out of business and they kept them afloat, invested in them and now they make money,\" Valentine said. \"He has done things very unorthodox compared to the rest of the industry, but hes done it under the law.\", Reddy, 65, was born and raised in India, the eldest of four children from a farming family. Their home had no electricity, no potable drinking water. He was the first in the family to receive any formal education., While attending medical school, Reddy met his wife, Venkamma. The couple moved to the United States in 1976 to begin a residency program at Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, N.Y., While attending a medical conference in Anaheim, Reddy learned about an opening for a cardiologist at St. Marys Medical Center in San Bernardino County. He liked the Apple Valley suburbs quiet pace., \"It was like coming back to the village where I came from,\" he said. \"A lot of tumbleweeds.\", He learned a quick lesson about living in the desert community, which he still calls home: When tumbleweeds drift onto the road, \"You need to be careful not to swerve your car. You need to hit them straight on.\", Its how he approaches business too., Through the years, Prime Healthcare has developed a model to help turn money-losing hospitals profitable, Reddy said. It slashes middle management, which reduces costs and speeds decision-making. And if insurance contracts pay too little, he negotiates new ones., The turnaround of Centinela hospital was key to a region that had been hit by the closures of Daniel Freeman in Inglewood, Robert F. Kennedy Hospital in Hawthorne and Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center near Watts., \"Centinela was in danger of closing,\" Inglewood Mayor James T. Butts Jr. said. \"It now flourishes.\", Still, many people have asked Reddy whether acquiring the Daughters of Charity hospitals is worth the fight., \"I have more than enough money to satisfy me and my family, but thats not whats important to me,\" he said. \"Its the mission: saving hospital companies, saving lives. That fire wont die, until I die.\", stuart.pfeifer@latimes.com, Twitter: @spfeifer22]", "Date": "20150201", "Title": "[ Hospital chain Prime Healthcare faces a fight to grow]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-prem-reddy-20150201-story.html", "Author": "[Stuart Pfeifer]"}
{"Content": "[[, By all accounts, the Central Valley is a place where Latino candidates should win elections., Latino political activism here dates back to the farmworker movement of the 1960s. In one congressional district that stretches up through the valley from Kern County to Fresno County, nearly 3 out of 4 residents are Latino., Yet Latino candidates election losses have piled up here in recent years  in large part because Latinos arent turning out to vote., For all the talk of the growing Latino electorate and the pivotal role it is expected to play in the 2016 presidential race, there is another often overlooked demographic reality: Latinos, along with Asian Americans, remain dramatically underrepresented in most U.S. elections., Half a century after passage of the Voting Rights Act, which ended legal barriers to voting for blacks across the South, blacks and whites now vote at roughly equal rates, especially in presidential elections. But Latinos and Asians lag far behind in all races, even when noncitizen immigrants are accounted for., As a result, the U.S. electorate may be less reflective of the nations ethnic and racial diversity today than it was in the 1950s, when the country was 90% white, according to political scientist Bernard Fraga of Indiana University, who studies minority voting trends., NEWSLETTER:Get the days top headlines from Times Editor Davan Maharaj >>, In the 2014 midterm election, only 27% of eligible Latinos voted, compared with 46% of whites and 41% of African Americans, according to U.S. census data., While the Latino vote is big and growing -- 40 million Latinos will be eligible to vote in 2030, up from about 25 million in 2014 -- its nowhere near as big as it could be., Theres more Latinos and more eligible Latino voters in the United States than ever before, Fraga said. They should have even greater voting strength than they do. They should be even more of a force in politics. But a lot of them arent turning out to vote., Understanding why Latinos arent voting at a higher rate is an urgent question for candidates and parties who depend on Latino votes to win., Democrats say they will need a big Latino turnout to carry swing states such as Nevada, Colorado and probably Florida in the 2016 presidential race. In next years Senate race in California, U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez(D-Santa Ana) will depend on Latino votes in her race against state Atty. Gen.Kamala Harris., But there are many hurdles to improving turnout., Latinos on average are younger than other groups, and young people of all races tend to vote less than their elders. Last year, 33% of Latinos eligible to vote were 18 to 29, according to the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, compared with 18% of whites, 25% of African Americans and 21% of Asian Americans., The Latino population is also heavily concentrated in two places, Texas and California, that have not been swing states in presidential elections for decades. Nearly half the countrys Latino eligible voters live in those two states., Because Democrats can usually count on winning statewide races in California and Republicans in Texas, neither party in those states has had an incentive to invest the huge sums necessary to register and turn out lots more Latino voters. By contrast, a large percentage of the black population lives in swing states that have been a heavy focus of voter registration efforts., Organizations and political parties arent focused enough on this segment of the population, said Marcela Ruiz, deputy director of California Rural Legal Assistance, which provides legal assistance to the states rural poor., Last year, only 17% of eligible Latinos and 18% of eligible Asian Americans in California voted, according to an analysis by the UC Davis Center for Regional Change. Turnout among all other racial groups was 40%., Antonio Gonzalez, president of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project, said rapid population growth among Latinos and limited funds for registration makes it hard to keep up., His organization will register about20,000 new Latino voters this year in several states, he said. With more money, it could do much more., Its a good market, a growing market, he said. Nationally, about 800,000 Latinos turn 18 and become eligible to vote each year., Flavia Jimenez, a senior attorney with the Advancement Project, a civil rights advocacy organization, said Latinos would have more representation if the roughly 5million Latinos who are legal permanent residents became citizens. Reducing the cost of the naturalization process would be a good first step, Jimenez said., There are also cultural theories about why Latinos vote at lower rates. Many Latino voters are immigrants or the children of immigrants, and many have not grown up in families in whichvoting was common practice., Unlike African Americans, whose civil rights struggles in the 1960s were intensely focused on winning the right to vote, some Latino immigrants may not have positive associations with electoral politics., Adelina Sanchez, 32, who grew up in this Central Valley town southeast of Bakersfield, said some of her Mexican immigrant relatives refuse to vote because they dont trust the political system. Theyre so traumatized by politics in Mexico, she said., Fredi Castrejon, 30, a Lamont resident who sits on the board of the local Recreation and Parks District, said some immigrant voters dont believethey have a voice., Sometimes we become citizens, but were still afraid to fully come out of the shadows, said Castrejon, a Mexican immigrant who became a U.S. citizen several years ago., Last fall, Castrejon went door to door seeking votes for Amanda Renteria, a Democrat who lost to Republican incumbent Rep. David Valadao in the 21st Congressional District and who now is political director for Hillary Rodham Clintons presidential campaign. Latinos are a majority of registered voters in the district, but only a third of themvoted, compared with half of non-Latinos, according an analysis of exit polls by Political Data Inc., a bipartisan data vendor., We had the numbers for her to win, Castrejon said. But turnout was so low., Renterias loss was one of several Latino defeats in recent years. In 2013, Democratic Kern County Supervisor Leticia Perez lost to Republican cherry farmer Andy Vidak in a special state Senate election, despite the fact that the district is two-thirds Latino., There have been victories at the local level, Castrejon said, including the election of several young Latinos to the City Council in the nearby town of Arvin. Latinos have also led campaigns in several Central Valley towns, including Visalia, to change elections from at-large ballotingto voting by geographic district  a model that tends to favor minorities., Several organizations that work with voters in the region say theyre learning what works to boost turnout., A statewide nonprofit organization called California Calls identifies registered voters who arent turning out for elections and targets them with in-person and telephone voter education campaigns., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, We go back to these people again and again and again, said Karla Zombro, field director for the group, and were changing their voting behavior over time., In 2014, Latino voters that the group targeted turned out at a rate nearly 20% higher than other Latino voters, Zombro said., For years, many groups focused simply on getting Latinos registered to vote., But just registering voters is not enough, said Camila Chavez, executive director of the Dolores Huerta Foundation, a nonprofit civic engagement group cofounded by Huerta, the famed farmworker organizer., Now theorganization hosts house parties where neighbors can talk to neighbors about important ballot measures and other community initiatives, Chavez said. Canvassers ask for cellphone numbers and email addresses so they can follow up and remind people to vote on election day., Leticia Prado, 48, who runs a secondhand clothing store in Lamont, said the longer Latinos live in their communities, the more invested they will be in electoral politics., Several years ago, Prado helped lead the fight for a small tax increase that paid for a new gymnasium at a school in a nearby town. Now she sits on local school and water boards., The experience taught her a lesson that she often shares with voters while canvassing for community initiatives or candidates., Nothing is going to change in this community, she tells them, unless we change it., kate.linthicum@latimes.com, Twitter:@katelinthicum, MORE POLITICAL COVERAGE, Uproar among House GOP conservatives forces new strategy on Iran vote, Some Republicans see Ben Carson as Trump minus bluster plus faith, Jeb Bush unveils tax plan to slash rates for corporations and top earners, ]", "Date": "20150910", "Title": "[The Latino vote is growing -- but it could be much bigger]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-latino-voters-20150910-story.html", "Author": "[Kate Linthicum]"}

The really big contributions  to the \"super PACs\" that are theoretically independent from the campaigns, but in practice closely allied with them  wont be publicly disclosed until the end of the month., Dollars given directly to a campaign can stretch farther than money raised by super PACs, in part because campaigns get a preferential rate for television advertising and in part because the money is directly controlled by the candidates, making it easier for them to focus their message and marshal get-out-the-vote efforts., The state is critical in presidential elections and will continue to be critical,\" said Paul Seamus Ryan, senior counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan group that tracks campaignfinanceand laws that regulate it. \"California and New York are where the money is ... no question when it comes to national politics.\", Both Rubio and Perry got 22% of their itemized contributions from California, $1.5 million in Rubios case and just short of $219,000 for Perry., Clinton has raised more than $8 million for her campaign committee in California so far, just over 20% of her total. Her campaign took in more from California than all the other presidential candidates combined., Her strongest challenger, Sen.

More than 40% of her contributions came from the state., By contrast, former Florida Gov.

They castigated his former secretary of State and leading Democratic presidential contender Hillary Rodham Clinton as like-minded., After a decade of discontent  a period that included part of the last Republican presidents tenure  the American people are looking for a new direction, Perry declared as he co-opted Obamas 2008 slogan: They want real hope, real change and real leadership., Fiorina took aim at the dominance of Californias Democrats, blaming them for the states economic woes and the gap between its billionaires and the poverty-stricken., California is the test case; it is the proof positive of what happens when liberals are in charge for too long, she said., The daylong event at the historic Fox Performing Arts Center in Riverside drew more than 850 attendees, and was formed by two components: a drive by conservative groups to coalesce their strength, and the faint hope that with a huge and fluctuating Republican field, the 2016 race could be undecided as the campaign roars into the states late primary., California could become the kingmaker on the Republican side in June of 2016, and the people here are going to remember who came and asked for their vote instead of treating the state like an ATM, said John Berry, statewide co-coordinator for the Tea Party Patriots group., Although Berry acknowledged that the chance of California going Republican in a general election is a long shot, he said conservative groups were working to influence elections large and small. The Unite Inland Empire coalition that sponsored the conservative gathering represented two dozen groups that previously operated separately., The Inland Empire itself is not exactly Republican-red any more; Obama won Riverside and San Bernardino counties in 2008 and 2012. But in the political gradations of the state, inland areas still remain a deeper well of potential support for Republican candidates., The bent of the events sponsors, speakers and attendees was evident  from references to Barack Hussein Obama to discussions of the attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, and other issues that have formed the backbone of conservative criticism of the president., But it was also a group hostile to what it saw as more establishment Republicans. A video airing on a loop throughout the day mocked both Obama and 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney. Several caustic references were made to a prospective candidate  they did not mention former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush by name  who one speaker said is very, very, very supportive of Common Core. Boos ensued., Jindal added to the fervor by citing the education standards as one of the countrys three biggest problems  along with terrorism and Obamas healthcare program. In a lengthy denunciation, he did not mention his past support for the standards but contended that, in lieu of government involvement, the best way to fix education in America is to trust moms and dads., Foreign policy served as a common cudgel for all three speakers., For too long this administration has led from behind, lurched from crisis to crisis guided by moral and strategic ambivalence, Perry said. We need to summon up that spirit of old that led us to vanquish the communists and the fascists in the last century. , The only thing that these tyrants respect are strength and resolve, he said of leaders in Russia, Iran and elsewhere. We need to rebuild our military; we need to reassert our moral authority at home and overseas. Now is the time for moral clarity, not moral confusion., Fiorina mocked Clintons 2009 presentation of a faux reset button to Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister., Ive sat across a table from Vladimir Putin. You dont have to spend very much time with that man to understand that his ambition will not be changed by a gimmicky red reset button, she said., Jindal described Obamas tenure in near-apocalyptic terms; the crowd whooped and repeatedly rewarded him with standing ovations., I hate to say this, but we have a president right now who is not qualified to be our commander in chief, Jindal said. He added later: It is important we win for the future, for the sake of the United States of America. We have a president who is bankrupting us financially, morally, internationally; we have a president intent on redefining what it is America stands for, intent on redefining the American dream., Despite the rare occasion of a multi-candidate event in California, the candidates spent little time on issues that are particularly salient here., An exception came when Fiorina, who unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate from California in 2010, blamed Democratic regulations for denuding the Central Valley. It is not just the agricultural land that has been ruined  its that lives and livelihoods have been destroyed at the altar of liberal ideology, she said., Perry forwarded the subject of illegal immigration to cement his conservative bona fides. (When he ran for president in 2012, he suffered for Texas policies deemed too liberal by other Republicans, including support for in-state tuition for college students lacking official papers.), Fiorina, answering questions from reporters after her speech, blamed Obama for the immigration impasse in Washington. (An immigration measure has stalled in the Republican-controlled House.), To solve this problem we have to get serious about security at the border, she said. We have to get serious about fixing the legal immigration system, which has been broken for decades. Of course we have to get serious about how we handle the people who are already here., She did not, however, say how., cathleen.decker@latimes.com, Twitter: @cathleendecker, , 8:23 p.m.: This story has been updated throughout., This story was originally published at 2:58 p.m.]", "Date": "20150221", "Title": "[A rare sighting: Republican presidential prospects come to California]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-republicans-presidential-2016-20150221-story.html", "Author": "[Cathleen Decker]"}
{"Content": "[[, California legislative leaders have put a hold on a bill by Secretary of State Alex Padilla that would overhaul California elections in response to last years dismal voter turnout., A bill introduced for Padilla by Sen. Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica) would allow counties, beginning in 2018, to mail all voters ballots that could be marked and then cast at any of several voting centers to be opened around the county., Ballots could be cast at the centers during a 10-day period that includes election day. They also could be dropped off in secure boxes available 24 hours per day., The measure was scheduled to be heard Wednesday by the Assembly Elections and Redistricting Committee, but legislative leaders have put it on hold until January 2016, according to an email by Darren Chesin, chief consultant for the Senate Committee on Elections and Constitutional Amendments., Both the Speaker and the President Pro Tem of the Senate expressed support for the approach SB 450 takes so I am confident that it will make it to the Governors desk soon thereafter, Chesin wrote., Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles) and Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins (D-San Diego) issued a joint statement in which they committed to working with Allen during the coming months to come up with something that would be ready for public hearings next year., Since SB 450 was just recently introduced in the Assembly, Californias diverse communities have not had sufficient time to analyze and comment on this historic change to our voting system, the statement said. We support policies to increase voter turnout, but more time is needed for all the stakeholders to weigh-in to make sure we get the policy right., Padilla, who has differed on occasion with De Leon on issues, said he was not giving up on the bill., We have an urgent need to strengthen our democracy, and we owe it to all California citizens to make our elections more voter friendly, Padilla said in a statement., Allen said he is not discouraged by the delay. \"Whenever we make this type of transformative change, we need to be sure we get the details right,\" he said. \"To that end, we will be taking the next few months to work with stakeholders and both houses of the legislature to confirm every detail in the bill is technically correct, and logistically feasible.\", Meanwhile, a separate bill sponsored by Padilla that would have the Department of Motor Vehicles register to vote every eligible applicant for a license, was approved by an 8-3 vote Tuesday by the Senate Transportation Committee. AB 1461 is by Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego)., Some civil rights groups including the ACLU opposed the measure, saying now that the state Department of Motor Vehicles is issuing licenses to immigrants in the country illegally, they are concerned some may be registered by mistake and vote, jeopardizing their ability to stay in the country. , 3:55 p.m.: This post has been updated with comments by Sen.

{"Content": "[[, California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Wednesday that he has opened a fundraising account to run for governor in 2018., In an email to supporters, Newsom said \"our state is defined by its independent, outspoken spirit. When Californians see something we truly believe in, we say so and act accordingly  without evasiveness or equivocation., \"So today Im announcing that Im creating a committee to run for California governor in 2018. Because I truly and passionately believe in the future of this great state.\", Newsom has long wanted to be governor, and the move  more than three years before the election  is an early shot across the bow at other potential Democratic candidates. By forming a committee, Newsom can raise up to $28,200 per supporter for both the primary and general elections, meaning he can collect $56,400 per donor., The move immediately puts pressure on former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who is considering whether to challenge Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris in the 2016 U.S. Senate race, or possibly run for governor in 2018., No other candidate has opened a gubernatorial campaign committee, according to the secretary of states office., Gov. Jerry Brown will be termed out in 2018, so the field to be the states next governor has the potential to be large, especially on the Democratic side. Other potential Democratic candidates include billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer, who could easily self-fund a campaign, and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti., On the Republican side, speculation will swirl around San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, who leads the largest city in the nation with a GOP leader, and Fresno Mayor Ashley Swearengin, who lost her state controller bid in 2014., Newsom, 47, gained national attention during his tenure as mayor San Francisco for his 2004 decision to have the city issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. He also launched the countrys first universal healthcare initiative. But he also suffered scandal  an affair with his campaign manager and close friends wife., Newsom ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2010, but bowed out once it became clear that Brown would clinch the nomination. He has served as the states lieutenant governor since 2011 and has made little attempt to hide his boredom in the job, which he once derided as \"a largely ceremonial post  with no real authority and no real portfolio.\", Historically, it has not been a steppingstone to higher office. In Californias 165-year history, only twolieutenant governors have been elected to the top executive spot., In 2014, Newsoms GOP rival Ron Nehring said the incumbent treated the job as a taxpayer-funded gubernatorial exploratory committee for 2018., The job is low-profile, though Newsom has tried to use it as a platform, frequently appearing on national news programs. He also authored Citizenville, a book that drew praise from unlikely quarters, such as former House Speaker Newt Gingrich., Newsom has less name recognition than the states top Democratic leaders. About six in 10 registered California voters were able to identify him in an October poll by the USC and the Los Angeles Times. Thirty percent viewed him favorably, while 19% held an unfavorable opinion. His support was strongest in his Bay Area home base, where 59% held favorable views, and he is less well known in other parts of the state., Follow@LATSeemafor political news., seema.mehta@latimes.com, 9:43 a.m.: This post was updated with a statement from Gavin Newsom., ]", "Date": "20150211", "Title": "[Gavin Newsom starts fundraising for 2018 gubernatorial bid]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-pc-newsom-governor-20150210-story.html", "Author": "[Seema Mehta]"}
{"Content": "[[, California State University trustees are expected to discuss spending priorities for the additional $216.6 million in funding approved in the 2015-16 state budget and will vote on a proposed pay hike for university executives during a meeting Tuesday in Long Beach., Part of the discussion will center on Cal States successful 18-month letter-writing, lobbying and Twitter campaign to persuade Gov. Jerry Brown and the Legislature to approve the systems full funding request as opposed to the governors initial $119.5 million proposal., The final budget agreement is the first time since 2006 that the state has fully funded the universitys annual plea for additionalsupport, officials said. Overall state spending for Cal State totals about $3 billion., The new funding will allow the 23-campus system to enroll an additional12,000 students for spring of 2016 and the following fall, as well as hire more full-time faculty, counselors and other staff., Another $65.5 million will be used to increase the pool for employee compensation by about 2%., On Tuesday, trustees will vote on a proposal to use some of those funds to increase salaries by 2% for the campus presidents, Chancellor Timothy P. White and six other executive vice chancellors and vice chancellors effective July 1., Top executives received a 3% pay hike in 2014-15. That was the first across-the-board increase since 2007, officials said., Besides their state-funded salary, White and six campus presidents also receive supplemental compensation from private campus foundations. The 2014-15 pay hikes were controversial because they were calculated on this total compensationwhile being paid for with state funds., Several trustees at the time expressed misgivings about using tax dollars to augment private money., The proposed 2% hike will also be based on total compensation, and executives hired after July 1 would receive the pay increase effective on the date of hire., Cal State has been criticized in the past for boosting salaries for newly hired presidents, especially during the recession amid a succession of tuition hikes.

{"Content": "[[, California will have the nations first statewide ban on disposable plastic bags under a measure signed Tuesday by Gov. Jerry Brown, who also expanded gun controls and personal privacy protections in an eclectic final flurry of bill signings for the year., The governor rejected several new ethics proposals, passed in the wake of corruption scandals that have plagued the state Senate, saying the measures would have complicated political rules while having little effect., Many of the new laws were inspired by other headlines: Last springs slayings in Isla Vista, Calif., spurred a measure to allow the temporary seizure of firearms from people deemed to be a threat, and revelations about the federal governments spying programs led to fresh limits on data collection., The plastic bag ban, which set off one of the fiercest lobbying battles in the Capitol this year, requires grocery stores and pharmacies to stop dispensing single-use plastic bags beginning July 1. They must offer paper and reusable plastic bags instead, and charge at least 10 cents each., The ban will be extended to convenience and liquor stores in July 2016., The new law \"reduces the torrent of plastic polluting our beaches, parks and even the vast ocean itself,\" Brown said in a statement. \"Were the first to ban these bags, and we wont be the last.\", Hawaii has pursued a similar goal, with every county in that state adopting its own ban. Californias prohibition is the first statewide law passed by a legislature, although more than 125 local ordinances against plastic bags have been adopted in the state, including in the city of Los Angeles., The local laws are grandfathered in under the new overall measure, SB 270 by Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Pacoima), and the state will provide $2 million in loans to help plastic-bag businesses convert to the manufacture of reusable bags., Environmentalists pushed for the ban, arguing that the bags sully rivers and oceans and endanger wildlife, such as sea turtles, which mistake the litter for food., The activists, alongside grocers and employee unions, squared off against makers of plastic and paper bags, who said the prohibition would cost jobs and enrich grocers collecting fees for alternative bags., Lee Califf, executive director of the plastic-bag industry group American Progressive Bag Alliance, dismissed the bill as \"a backroom deal between the grocers and union bosses  under the guise of environmentalism.\", Califfs group has filed papers in an attempt to qualify a referendum to repeal SB 270 on the November 2016 ballot. If the group collects 504,760 petition signatures in the next 90 days, the new law will be suspended until the 2016 vote., Also on Tuesday  four months after a disturbed man killed six UC Santa Barbara students and wounded 13 other people  Brown approved the temporary seizure of guns from people determined by courts to be a threat to themselves or anyone else., The family of the killer, Elliot Rodger, had previously sought help because he was behaving strangely, but law enforcement officials took no action after questioning him., The new law permits law enforcement authorities or family members to ask a court to bar a dangerous person from possessing firearms for 21 days. Democratic Assembly members Das Williams of Santa Barbara and Nancy Skinner of Berkeley introduced the bill, AB 1014., \"Family members are often the first to spot the warning signs when someone is in crisis,\" Skinner said in a statement, adding that the bill \"provides an effective tool to get guns out of the hands of loved ones to avoid these tragedies.\", Elliot Rodgers father, Peter, issued a statement of thanks, saying, \"California today is a safer state because of this legislation. Lets hope other states follow.\", But several gun groups objected to the measure, noting that the gun owner may not receive a hearing before a restraining order is issued. A hearing must be held within 21 days of an order., \"Without a doubt, AB 1014 is one of the most egregious violations of civil liberties ever introduced in the California Legislature,\" Charles H. Cunningham, a director with the National Rifle Assn.s Institute for Legislative Action, wrote to lawmakers during the summer, before the bill passed., Brown also approved bills Tuesday that address Californians privacy, including a measure spurred by federal intelligence agencies acknowledgment that they have collected vast amounts of records on phone calls and Internet use by Americans., One is SB 828, by Sen. Ted Lieu (D-Torrance), which bars state agencies from cooperating with such efforts unless a warrant has been issued., Two others expand the states law against \"revenge porn,\" in which someone posts nude or sexually explicit photos of a former romantic partner online as retaliation for a breakup or other dispute., One, AB 2643 by Assemblyman Bob Wieckowski (D-Fremont), allows victims to seek court orders to have such photos taken down as well as to pursue damages., Another expands the revenge porn prohibition to \"selfies,\" or photos taken by the person in the picture. Sen. Anthony Cannella (R-Ceres) introduced that measure, SB 1255., Overall, Brown signed the vast majority of bills sent him by the Legislature this year, approving 930 and vetoing 143., His vetoes Tuesday included several proposals by legislative leaders seeking to regain public confidence after three Democratic senators were charged with crimes., One bill would have cut the value of gifts state lawmakers and others could receive and barred them from continuing to accept free tickets to sports events, concerts and theme parks and complimentary golf., The bill, SB 1443 by state Sen. Kevin de Len (D-Los Angeles), would be \"adding further complexity without commensurate benefit,\" Brown wrote. \"Proper disclosure, as already provided by the law, should be sufficient to guard against undue influence.\", Another bill would have required the state to develop a new, publicly accessible online campaign reporting system and require that candidates use it to file their financial information every calendar quarter, rather than semiannually., Brown said state technology could not yet accommodate the changes contained in the bill, SB 1442 by state Sen. Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens)., Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento) called the vetoes \"an opportunity missed.\", But Jessica Levinson, an election-law professor at Loyola Law School, disagreed, saying Brown was right to reject lawmakers \"knee-jerk reaction\" to the recent scandals, which included federal corruption charges as well as perjury and voter fraud convictions for the other., \"There was a lot of political will to propose ethics reform,\" she said, \"but Jerry Brown  understands that more regulation isnt always good regulation.\", The governor did not veto every ethics bill; he signed two measures barring lobbyists from hosting political fundraisers in their homes and offices., Those proposals were made after a prominent lobbyist was fined heavily for hosting events at his Sacramento home, where he lavished dozens of officials with expensive liquor and cigars., The bills are AB 1673 by Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia (D-Bell Gardens) and SB 1441 by Lara., patrick.mcgreevy@latimes.com, melanie.mason@latimes.com, Twitter: @mcgreevy99, @melmason]", "Date": "20140930", "Title": "[Statewide ban on disposable plastic bags is signed into law by Brown]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-pol-brown-bills-20141001-story.html", "Author": "[Patrick McGreevy, Melanie Mason]"}
{"Content": "[[, Californias top elections officer on Wednesday expanded his proposed overhaul of the way citizens vote, aiming to make it easier for them to cast ballots., Secretary of State Alex Padilla wants the state to mail all voters a ballot and allow them to use it at any of several voting centers during a 10-day period before elections. That would allow people to vote near their jobs or other convenient locations rather than limit them to visiting polling places near their homes on election day or mailing in their ballots., Voters also would be able to drop ballots off 24 hours a day at secure locations during a 14-day period before elections., California ranked 43rd in voter turnout nationally for the 2014 General Election. This problem cannot be ignored, Padilla said in a statement. Civic participation is the foundation of our democracy., His proposal has been put into legislation by Sens. Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica) and Bob Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys)., In elections in California, government fundamentally thinks only about itself, Hertzberg said. This measure flips the situation on its head so that the convenience of voting is the top priority., The proposed changes are modeled after laws in Colorado, which has much higher voter participation than California. If passed and signed into law, the legislation, SB 450, would depend on the state completing a new computer voter registration system in June 2016., Padilla has sponsored another bill that would register to vote everyone who gets a drivers license in California, unless they opt out., The new legislation incorporates ideas previously included in other bills. A pending bill by Allen also calls for voting centers to be open before election day. A measure by Sen. Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills) would create secure drop-off sites where ballots could be left before election day., California officials were alarmed when just 30.9% of eligible citizens voted in the November 2014 state election. In Colorado, the number was 56.9%., Since voting days were added in Colorado, turnout there has averaged 20.7 percentage points higher than in California, Padilla said., SB 450 would provide citizens more options for when, where and how they vote, Padilla said. Providing more options will help more citizens vote, despite our often busy lives., Twitter:@mcgreevy99, ALSO:, California is flush with cash.

{"Content": "[[, Calling Tuesdays election a defining political moment, Rep. Cory Gardner swept to victory in a closely watched race, ousting Democratic Sen. Mark Udall and becoming the first Republican Colorado has sent to the Senate in more than a decade., \"The people of Colorado, voters around this state, had their voices heard. They are not red, they are not blue, but they are crystal clear. Crystal clear in their message to Washington, D.C.: Get your job done and get the heck out of the way,\" Gardner said, flanked onstage in a packed Denver hotel ballroom by a host of local Republicans who also claimed victory., Gardner won after a furious campaign that drew a blizzard of money from candidates, parties and deep-pocketed outside groups., \"Colorado indeed became the fulcrum in the balance of power,\" he said to roaring applause. \"Tonight we commit ourselves to building a government we can be proud of again.\", Not since 2002 has a Colorado Republican won a U.S. Senate seat or the governors mansion. Moreover, not since 1978 had an incumbent senator lost reelection in the state., The governors race remained too close to call late Tuesday. With nearly 87% of precincts reporting, Gov. John Hickenlooper narrowly trailed, with 47.6% to Republican Bob Beauprezs 48.0%., The Senate race had featured Democrats argument that Republicans were waging war on women with their views on contraception, abortion rights and personhood. Gardner blunted the assault by reversing his views on personhood measures  which hold that human rights begin at conception  and calling for dispensing birth control pills over the counter., In an effort to appeal to women voters from all-important Jefferson and Arapahoe counties -- which often tilt statewide elections here -- Udall pushed the reproductive rights issues so hard that he lost endorsements and drew criticism from some supporters for banking on a single issue in the campaign. The Denver Post dubbed him \"Mark Uterus.\" , Tuesdays results were a clear rebuke of Udalls message., Like other Republicans across the country, Gardner assailed the Democrat as an ally of President Obama, whose popularity has fallen here despite two successive Colorado victories in presidential years., For several months, polls had shown the Senate race mostly tied, though in the final weeks Gardner began to pull ahead. He stayed on message while Udall teetered in the waning days from a focusing on reproductive rights to urging Latinos and young voters to support his candidacy., Many political observers had thought the state was transforming from a purple toss-up to more blue, especially after Obama won the state in 2008 and 2012. But strong statewide discontent with Obama gave Colorado Republicans confidence., Udall, who was seeking a second term, grew emotional when thanking constituents for allowing him to serve as senator for the past six years. Invoking his late father, former Rep. Morris Udall of Arizona, Udall said its important in life to laugh and live life to the fullest., \"So that whenever you lose youre ahead. As long as Ive had the privilege to serve the people of Colorado, all of the times Ive come out ahead, tonight is no exception,\" Udall said., Gardner gave up a safe House seat in eastern Colorado to challenge Udall. He will join Republicans in taking control of the Senate., Marty Neilson, a Republican from Boulder County, attended the GOP gathering at a hotel in south Denver., \"Im jubilant. This is great for our country to have Republicans in control of Congress and leading in Colorado, because Im a Coloradan and Ive seen this state headed down the wrong path these years,\" Neilson said., As for the governors race, contentious battles over gun control in 2013 and renewable energy gave Republicans ammunition to attack Hickenlooper and Democrats as overplaying their hand., The governor touted his work in lowering Colorados jobless rate, as well as the job his administration did helping open dozens of roads after last years epic flooding., We made a lot of tough decisions in these past few years and Im proud of the work weve done, Hickenlooper said Tuesday., Twitter: @kurtisalee, 10:44 p.m.: This post was updated throughout., 8:48 p.m.: This post was updated with vote totals and with the last time that a U.S. senator lost reelection in Colorado., 8:13 p.m.: This post was updated with details., This post was first published at 7:26 p.m.]", "Date": "20141104", "Title": "[Colorado Senate: Republican Cory Gardner defeats incumbent Udall]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-colorado-20141104-story.html", "Author": "[Kurtis Lee]"}
{"Content": "[[, Carly Fiorina, the only woman to announce her candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination, is no Sarah Palin. Shes no Michele Bachmann, either., And the GOP should be thankful. She isnt a quitter like Palin, whostepped down as Alaska governor barely half way through her first term. She is not given to nutty pronouncements like former U.S. Rep. Bachmann, wholinked the HPV vaccine to mental retardation on national television based on something a mom once told her., Unlike Palin, who was plucked from obscurity by a desperate John McCain, Fiorina earned her place at the top of the corporate heap. And unlike Bachmann, who recently warned that PresidentObamas policies on gay marriage and Iran are hastening the rapture, she appears to have all her marbles., Finally, the Republican Party is fielding a woman who is up to the challenge of running for president. Unfortunately, she seems to have forgotten theres a primary going on right now. She has skipped over all that, and is waging her own general election against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton., \"If Hillary Clinton faces a woman opponent,\" Fiorina said earlier this year, \"she will get a hitch in her swing.\", For that, Fiorina, who is tough and smart, has become a favorite speaker at conservative gatherings. On Wednesday, she will be among the featured speakers at the Republican National Committees spring meeting in Scottsdale, Ariz., As the first woman to run a Fortune 20 American company, she is a bona fide American feminist pioneer. Her edges can be a little sharp, but it appears that she is starting to develop a sense of playfulness, a quality not always evident in her public appearances., Last week, late night talk show host Seth Meyers ribbed her for failing to purchase the domain name carlyfiorina.org, which was bought by a detractor who posted 30,000 frownie face emoticons representing the number of layoffs she engineered as Hewlett-Packards first female CEO., Do you know who owns SethMeyers.org? she asked Meyers. I do. I just bought it in the green room. So you better be really nice to me. Later, she told Meet the Press host Chuck Todd that she purchased chucktodd.org. (Both URLs redirect to carlyforpresident.com.), Still, all the humor in the world will not offset the parts of her record that could haunt her as she seeks her partys nomination for president., Though she broke the ultimate corporate glass ceiling as HPs CEO, she flamed out in spectacular fashion when the board of directors canned her some 5 1/2 years into the job. She had upended HPs famously collegial culture, killed off its beloved profit-sharing program and hung her own portrait between those of the companys two sainted founders, affectionately known as Bill and Dave., She fought a bitter proxy battle against the founders grown children over a merger with Compaq. And though the merger was approved, she was wounded by the battle and never really recovered. Under Fiorina, HPs stock plummeted by 50%., On the campaign trail, she appears undaunted by her reputation as one of the worst tech CEOs of all time., Last Sunday onMeet the Press, host Todd asked her why HPs board fired her. It is an excellent question. In interviews, board members have said that she had big vision but was unable to execute it. Some of her detractors have said she was too distracted by her growing fame to steward the company in its new incarnation. She told Todd she was the victim of a \"boardroom brawl.\", What people fail to comment on is the fact we doubled the size of the company, took the growth rate from 2% to 9%, Fiorina said. We tripled the rate of innovation to 11 patents a day and went from lagging behind to leading in every product category. We grew jobs here in the U.S. and all over the world., Thats not exactly true. As I documented in a2010 story examining Fiorinas business career, Hewlett-Packard did indeed grow under her leadership. But that was mostly because she acquired other businesses at a breathtaking rate, not because she grew jobs from scratch., In fact, she was also responsible for laying off an estimated 33,000 American workers, and was well known for her enthusiastic deportation of their jobs, which she described with the cringe-inducing phrase right shoring. In 2004, she told Congress, There is no job that is Americas God-given right anymore., She will also undoubtedly have to deal with questions about her companys dealings with Iran. When she ran Hewlett-Packard, the company was able to skirt a U.S. trade embargo against Iran by selling products through an intermediary. Strictly speaking, HP broke no laws, but the company certainly violated the spirit of the embargo and has since amended its practice., As polished as she is from her years in the corporate spotlight, Fiorina has fumbled in her previous forays into politics., In 2008, as a surrogate for Republican presidential nominee John McCain, she got into trouble when she suggested that neither the senator nor his running mate, Palin, was capable of running a corporation. The McCain campaign yanked her from public view., Two years later, in 2010, she ran against Democratic U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxerand lost by a whopping 10 points. Many political observers described Boxer as a vulnerable incumbent, but given Californias demographics, lopsided voter registration rolls and Boxers financial advantage, I think people were trying to make an uncompetitive race sound more interesting that it actually was. Fiorina never really stood a chance., Sort of like now., In the end, it probably doesnt matter how Fiorina spins her career, since her campaign  like that of former neurosurgeon Ben Carson  is probably more strategic than serious. She has spent far more of her time attacking presumed Democratic nominee Clinton than trying to differentiate herself from her numerous Republican opponents., This lends credence to the theory that her most important role in the 2016 campaign will be as a Clinton antagonist, helping inoculate her male counterparts against charges of sexism., Her CEOs self-assurance, always on abundant display, has already come in handy. Unlike Hillary Clinton, she said last weekend, I am not afraid to answer questions about my track record or my accomplishments or my principles., That may be. But the problem for Fiorina is that she isnt running against Hillary Clinton.

{"Content": "[[, China marked the 32nd anniversary of its constitution this week with unprecedented fanfare -- and continued violations of citizens rights., The nations first-ever Constitution Day was held Thursday, with celebrations across the country. Thousands of schools staged readings of the 135-article document, while national television aired images of judicial employees swearing an oath to the text. In Shanghai, officials organized screenings of two American films, The Shawshank Redemption and Training Day, which authorities said showed the dangers of corruption and promoted awareness of the law., As the nominal backbone to Chinas government, the constitution outlines the structure of the state and general principles of the government, and lists the rights of citizens -- including freedom of speech, religion and assembly. But the document also clearly states the primacy of the Communist Party, and without a system of checks and balances, the state frequently runs roughshod over what it claims to protect., The party almost never adheres to the constitution if other interests outweigh that. It tends to hold itself above the constitution, said Michael Davis, a professor specializing in constitutionalism and international law at Hong Kong University. When it comes to enforcement of the constitution, theres virtually none. , But Communist officials are trying to shore up public support by uprooting a deeply entrenched culture of corruption and curbing abuses of power. The newfound rhetorical attention lavished on the constitution is part of a broader effort to make the legal system more effective -- if not independent., Legal reform was the key topic at a major conclave of the Communist Party in October.The party vowed to increase implementation of the constitution, with a declaration afterward asserting that everyone in society must regard the constitution as the fundamental guideline of their activities. The National Peoples Congress later designated Dec. 4 as Constitution Day to promote awareness., The general public and officials awareness of the constitution is not fully in place, state-run media outlets said in an editorial this week. Some officials, including those from law enforcement agencies and judicial departments, have abused their power, infringing on citizens rights., But many experts outside China are skeptical that meaningful change is afoot. Chinas courts do not have a system of judicial review and cannot declare laws unconstitutional. Citizens are routinely thwarted in their attempts to exercise rights enshrined in the constitution. Because the party has unrestrained control over interpreting the constitution, critics say a new emphasis on the document in fact will only make the party stronger., A group of demonstrators who sought to voice their grievances with the government on Constitution Day found police blocked them from protesting in Tiananmen Square and in front of the headquarters of CCTV, the national broadcaster. Officers also scuffled with some of the demonstrators., Open discussion of constitutionalism was also curtailed. Forums on search engine Baidu titled The Constitution and Constitutional Governance were blocked by censors. (Party officials regard constitutionalism as a code word for Western-style democracy, an idea they cannot tolerate.), In an editorial, nationalistic newspaper the Global Times claimed this week that many Chinese have committed unconstitutional deeds because they do not understand the document and their rights. Among those they cited was Nobel Prize winner Liu Xiaobo, a democracy campaigner who was convicted of subversion and sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2009., Not only government officials, but radical activists have also violated the constitution, the editorial claimed. The most well-known is Liu Xiaobo and his Charter 08 movement in 2008. His actions were nothing but defiance of the constitution. , The Charter 08 manifesto called for separation of powers, an independent judiciary and elections, complaining that Chinas political progress has largely remained on paper: there are laws, but there is no rule of law; there is a constitution, but no constitutional government. ... The ruling elite continues to insist on its authoritarian grip on power., The first demand of Charter 08 was amending the constitution, asking that it become a law that no individual, party or group could violate. , Silbert is a special correspondent.]", "Date": "20141205", "Title": "[On first-ever 'Constitution Day,' China touts and flouts rights]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-constitution-day-china-touts-and-flouts-rights-20141205-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, Confident that hes secured hard-fought victories on some of his biggest initiatives, President Obama has turned his focus to perhaps the chief test of his legacy: the long-term outcome of the Iran nuclear deal., The president ramped up a public campaign Wednesday to sell the nation and the world on the merits of the deal engineered by his administration, saying its his best chance to make the world safer., \"Weve got a historic chance to pursue a safer and more secure world, an opportunity that may not come again in our lifetimes,\" he said. \"And as president and as commander in chief, I am determined to seize that opportunity.\", The stakes are high for Obama, who has enjoyed some success in using his executive authority to overcome opposition in Congress to his priorities on immigration, the environment and the economy. But whether the Iran deal is cemented as his crowning foreign policy achievement or an utter failure relies on some circumstances beyond his control., Irans compliance with the agreement and the willingness of Obamas successors to fully enforce it are two major keys to its future., \"A lot of presidents have made major strategic foreign policy bets,\" said Jon Alterman, Middle East specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"The stark reality is, hes not the one who will really implement the deal. Hes dependent on how his successor treats this and how the Iranians treat it. But hes not going to be in the drivers seat when this is judged.\", The point is not lost on Obama. In efforts to reassure critics and concerned allies during the years-long negotiations, the president made it plain that he was not taking the agreements potential long-term consequences lightly. Under its terms, crippling sanctions on Iran will be eased in return for a severe reduction of its capacity to produce a nuclear weapon and compliance with inspections., \"This deal will have my name on it,\" Obama said in May in an address at a Washington synagogue. \"Nobody has a bigger personal stake in making sure that it delivers on its promise.\", He put it in starker terms in a magazine interview: \"Look, 20 years from now, Im still going to be around, God willing. If Iran has a nuclear weapon, its my name on this.\", With a deal in hand, though, the president has sought to put it in historical context,  comparing it to major initiatives by Richard Nixon on China, or Ronald Reagan in reaching arms agreements with the Soviet Union., \"Hes definitely feeling good about himself,\" said James Goldgeier, dean of the American University School of International Service. \"Its important to put it in perspective of what hes accomplishing this year., \"After six years of questions about whether hed have any signature achievements in foreign policy, we now have the opening to Cuba, the nuclear deal with Iran  something that has been of concern to several administrations.\", Obama used an afternoon news conference to present himself as unfazed by condemnations of the deal. At one point in what became an unconventional, free-wheeling exchange with reporters, he seemed even to pose himself questions so he could rebut criticism. He also challenged critics to go beyond rhetoric and propose an alternative that achieves the goal of preventing an Iranian nuclear weapon., He conceded that the nascent accord addresses only a narrow facet of Irans disruptive behavior in the Middle East, though the one of most urgent concern. But he said that cutting off the governments nuclear capability would make it \"a lot easier for us to check Irans nefarious activities., \"Will we try to encourage them to take a more constructive path? Of course. But were not betting on it,\" he said. \"And in fact, having resolved the nuclear issue, we will be in a stronger position to work with Israel, work with the [Persian] Gulf countries, work with our other partners, work with the Europeans to bring additional pressure to bear on Iran around those issues that remain of concern.\", He and other administration officials have stepped up a campaign to reassure Democrats and other partners as Congress is set to begin a 60-day review period that includes a potential vote of approval or disapproval., Vice President Joe Biden, heading into a meeting Tuesday with House Democrats, said he was confident they would support the terms once they fully understand the deal., Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday escalated his own campaign against the accord in a series of interviews with American television network anchors., \"Im making a special appeal to everyone who is concerned with the future of our world,\" he told NBCs Lester Holt. \"To give the pre-eminent terrorist regime of our time access to nuclear weapons down the line, access to the capacity to make a very large nuclear arsenal with zero breakout time, in a few years, and money to finance terrorists today, I think that is a big, big mistake.\", Obama said that Israel has \"legitimate concerns\" and that he is committed to strengthening military and intelligence cooperation, but repeated that he was taking the best path., \"For all the objections of Prime Minister Netanyahu or, for that matter, some of the Republican leadership thats already spoken, none of them have presented to me or the American people a better alternative,\" he said., Advisors insist that the president was always willing to walk away from the negotiating table if a deal was not to his liking. Just two weeks ago, after the Supreme Court rendered significant victories on healthcare and same-sex marriage, he sought to make clear to negotiators that he felt secure in his legacy and didnt want them to think this accord was needed to bolster it., Still, he seemed resigned to a political fight., \"Based on the facts, the majority of Congress should approve of this. But we live in Washington,\" he told reporters., As his aides nervously looked on, the president scanned the East Room to seek out other objections that have been raised about the agreement. He noted at one point that he was running behind schedule, with Marine One ready to whisk him off on a trip to Oklahoma for the first visit by a president to a federal prison., \"But I really am enjoying this Iran debate,\" he said. \"I suspect this is not the last that weve heard of this.\"]", "Date": "20150715", "Title": "[ Long-term success of Iran deal will not be in Obama's hands]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-obama-iran-20150716-story.html", "Author": "[Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, Congress ended the crisis over funding for the Homeland Security Department on Tuesday after House Speaker John A. Boehner abandoned the GOPs strategy of trying to tack on restrictions to President Obamas immigration plan., House conservatives were outraged that the speaker declined to continue their fight against the presidents actions on immigration, which many Republicans view as an overreach of executive authority. They staged a series of procedural votes to prevent final approval. But the bill secured passage, allowing the Republican leadership to move away from a prolonged standoff that threatened the partys image as Homeland Security funds were set to expire at the end of the week., Obama is expected to swiftly sign the bill, which funds the departments vast domestic security and anti-terrorism apparatus through Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year. The vote was 257 to 167., Boehner was forced to leave his conservative flank behind and reach across the aisle for support from Democrats led by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco, something he has been repeatedly forced to do, though reluctantly, on major legislation., I am as outraged and frustrated as you at the lawless and unconstitutional actions of this president, Boehner told his majority as he announced his decision at a private meeting early Tuesday, according to a person in the room not authorized to discuss the session on the record., But facing a midnight Friday deadline for a second consecutive week to fund the department or risk its shutdown, giving in was the best course of action, he said., This decision  considering where we are  is the right one for this team, and the right one for this country, Boehner said., Just 75 Republicans voted to approve the measure; no Democrats opposed it., The Senate, under Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), approved the measure last week in a bipartisan vote, leaving Boehner few options., The sudden change of course arrived none too soon for Republican leaders who endured criticism for failing to manage their majority now that the party has control of Congress for the first time in eight years., The strategy of using the funding bill to force Obama to back down on his immigration plan has consumed the first two months of the new Congress, escalating Republicans tough rhetoric that has alienated Latinos and other minority groups the party is trying to court in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election., That approach failed in the Senate, where Democrats blocked repeated attempts by McConnell to advance the legislation with restrictions on Obamas plan to protect from deportation up to 5 million immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally., Unfortunately, the fight was never won in the other chamber, Boehner said. Democrats stayed united and blocked our bill, and our Republican colleagues in the Senate never found a way to win this fight., Boehner tried to persuade his rank-and-file to turn its attention to the court fight over Obamas action on immigration, which was temporarily halted last month by a federal judge in Texas. The administration is challenging the judges order., The good news is that the presidents executive action has been stopped, for now, Boehner told Republicans in the closed session. This matter will continue to be litigated in the courts, where we have our best chance of winning this fight., That offered no salve to House conservatives, who have been dissatisfied with Boehners tenure as speaker. They staged a series of procedural maneuvers, including forcing a partial reading of the bill, as a floor fight broke out between Republicans. Some have grumbled that another leader may be better, though they have been unable to coalesce around an alternative choice., We need to stand up, use the power of the purse, said Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who led the floor challenge., Its disappointing, said Rep. Luke Messer (R-Ind.). I hoped wed be able to continue the fight., We just have to keep fighting on all levels to prevent illegal executive amnesty, added another Republican, Rep. John Fleming of Louisiana., A funding cutoff would have furloughed some Homeland Security employees but forced most others to work without pay. The department oversees the Border Patrol, airport screenings and other crucial security programs, and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson had pleaded with Congress to provide stable funding., More pragmatic Republicans appeared relieved that the potentially damaging episode was over, for now, allowing the party to return to other parts of its agenda., Having a clean DHS bill will allow us move forward on not only this issue but other issues here in the future, said Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Turlock). My thought has always been that we do not think what the president has done is constitutional, but that is something we should address in an immigration bill., But those Republicans were clearly in the minority, forcing Boehner to rely on Pelosi for passage., The two leaders had been in several conversations since last weeks showdown, which culminated with a one-week funding extension the House approved just hours before the deadline Friday night. The Democratic leader suggested procedural options that could help Boehner bring a straightforward funding bill up for a vote, and Pelosi believed it was best to take up the issue as soon as possible, according to people familiar with the private conversations., On Monday evening, Boehner told her he planned to hold the vote the next day, after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus speech to a joint meeting of Congress, the sources said., At a private meeting Tuesday morning, she urged her Democratic colleagues to be on the floor as soon as the vote was called as a show of force., So that we can end this thing, Pelosi said., lisa.mascaro@latimes.com, Twitter: @lisamascaro, , 9:16 p.m.: The story was updated throughout with new information., 12:17 p.m.: The story was updated with the House vote., The story was originally published at 7:05 a.m.]", "Date": "20150303", "Title": "[House OKs Homeland Security funds as GOP gives up tactic on immigration]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-house-homeland-security-funding-20150303-story.html", "Author": "[Lisa Mascaro]"}
{"Content": "[[, Congress gave final approval to a $1.1-trillion spending bill to keep the government from shutting down, but not without a last-minute hitch when Republican Sen. Ted Cruz forced a rare Saturday session, defying party leaders efforts for smooth passage., The political gamesmanship not only put senators in a foul mood as they canceled weekend plans and braced for a round-the-clock session, but also shifted attention back onto Republican Party divisions that leaders have tried to temper as the GOP prepares to take full control of Congress in the new year., Few expected the sudden turn of events, even though the Texas Republican had vowed to use the spending bill as leverage to stop President Obamas immigration plan., Almost as surprising was the resolution to the standoff late Saturday evening. The vote was 56 to 40, clearing the legislation for the presidents signature., Throughout the day Saturday, anger and frustration among fellow Republicans spilled into the open over a strategy that many viewed as uncomfortably similar to the one that led to the 2013 government shutdown, which left the party badly bruised after conservatives followed Cruzs lead., In fact, just days earlier it was liberal Democrats who had taken the spotlight as threatening to derail the government funding package in the House, before Obama formed an unusual alliance with Speaker John A. Boehner to salvage the vote., But among Cruzs colleagues, much of the damage was done., This reminds me very much of the shutdown last year where the strategy made absolutely no sense and was counterproductive, said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). Ironically, the obstruction to getting the funding bill done had been coming from the other side of the aisle. But now I guess the blame will be shared., As an unintended consequence of the Saturday session, Democrats used the extra time to begin the process of confirming a slew of Obamas nominees next week  including his controversial choice for surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, who has drawn deep opposition from the National Rifle Assn. because of his advocacy of stricter gun laws., The 20 nominees, who also included the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and many district court judges, would not likely have otherwise been approved this year, with just days remaining in the lame-duck Congress., The end result of all of this throughout the weekend is the White House is going to end up with far more nominations confirmed than they ever would have, said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.). And actually, as I talk to Democrats on the floor, even though this is an usual process, most of them are pretty happy about the outcome., But among party conservatives, Cruz was cheered as a hero who was standing up to Obamas plan to defer deportations for up to 5 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally., Thank you, tweeted Erick Erickson, the conservative editor at Redstate.com, who suggested the hardball tactics not only helped the party win the Senate majority in the 2014 midterm election, but would boost the partys political currency heading into 2016., Cruz raised a point-of-order objection to allowing money to be spent on what he called Obamas unconstitutional immigration action, but it was rejected 74 to 22. , The Senate was launched into turmoil late Friday, after the Republican leadership had left the Capitol for the night, calling into question whether Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the incoming majority leader, will be able to control his most conservative members as Republicans prepare to run the Senate in the new year., Just before 9 p.m. Eastern time, Cruz strode onto the floor and took aim at the 1,603-page mess of a bill as the kind of backroom politics Americans abhor., Before the United States Senate is a bill that does nothing, absolutely nothing, to stop President Obamas illegal and unconstitutional amnesty, Cruz said. Thats why I rise here to speak., In many ways, the ability of the renegade senators, Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), to wrest control of the chamber over leaderships objections resembled the struggle Boehner has faced corralling his Republican majority in the House., Democrats had their own divisions as liberal Democrats, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, were raising strong objections to the bill and threatening its passage., Warren was trying, in a blistering floor speech Friday against big banks, to gut one provision that loosened rules on certain types of securities blamed as central to the 2008 financial crisis. Democrats also objected to a provision that lifts campaign caps for wealthy political donors., Most of us understand there are things in this bill we dont like, but we do have an overriding duty to our country to govern, said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). All I can say about democracy is it is messy. It is emotional. It requires give and take. It requires some people not to follow the hottest person in the room. And there will always be somebody running hot., lisa.mascaro@latimes.com, michael.memoli@latimes.com, 8:22 p.m.: This post was updated throughout., 7:10 p.m.: This post was updated with the final Senate vote., 2:13 p.m.:This post has been updated with Senate passage of a temporary spending measure to keep the federal government operating until Wednesday., This post was originally published at 11:21 a.m. PST.]", "Date": "20141213", "Title": "[Senate approves $1.1-trillion spending bill after deadline battle]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-senate-ted-cruz-saturday-session-government-shutdown-20141213-story.html", "Author": "[Lisa Mascaro, Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, Congress is again careening toward a crisis, this one fueled by opposition to President Obamas immigration plan, which threatens to cut off funding for the Homeland Security Department., The Senate is set to take a crucial vote Tuesday, but rather than resolve the standoff, the outcome is likely to accelerate it., And there is no easy compromise in sight., The problem flares from Republican opposition to Obamas immigration plan, announced last fall, to temporarily defer deportations for up to 5 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally, if they are law-abiding and meet other criteria., Obama said he was forced to act because Congress failed to produce its own immigration overhaul. But Republicans view his actions as an overreach of executive authority., Hoping to stop the president, House Republicans agreed to approve a $39.7-billion funding bill for the Homeland Security Department but only on the condition that none of it be used for Obamas new immigration proposals., The bill went a step further, effectively defunding Obamas 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. DACA has allowed more than 500,000 young immigrants, so-called Dreamers brought to the country illegally as children, to temporarily remain here for work, school and military service., But the Senate is expected to reject this approach., Even though Republicans have a Senate majority with 54 seats, they are short of the 60 votes needed to overcome a Democratic filibuster., Senate Democrats reject the GOPs attempts to stop the immigration reforms, and all of them backed a letter calling on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to instead pass a Homeland Security Departmentfunding bill that does not block Obamas actions., Opposition may come not just from Democrats; Republicans in the Senate also bristle at the House approach. GOP concerns were amplified after a recent report showed that stopping the presidents immigration policies would actually add $7.5 billion to the deficit over the next decade, according to a joint report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation. That would come largely because of lost tax revenue generated by employed immigrants who would be, in theory, deported., Adding pressure to the stalemate, the Homeland Security Department is poised to run out of money by the end of the month., \"We should pass a Homeland Security bill with no strings attached to it,\" said Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), the minority leader. \"Thats where were going to wind up.\", In times like these, a stopgap measure often emerges to temporarily provide funds while negotiations continue., But even that fallback strategy has problems this time. Simply continuing Homeland Security funding at current levels would leave the department without the $280-million boost both parties have already agreed to, an amount that rises to $1 billion when bipartisan disaster funds are included., Among the lost funds if Congress agrees only to a stopgap measure: a Coast Guard cutter being built in Mississippi; a biological defense center in Kansas to fight hoof-and-mouth disease and other agricultural dangers; and $50 million for the Secret Service to improve security and help protect the emerging 2016 presidential candidates, according to a Senate aide who was not authorized to speak publicly., Republican leaders have yet to come up with an alternative proposal that could win Democratic support., Several Republicans have suggested that shutting down the Homeland Security Department wouldnt pose a problem because some 85% of its employees are deemed essential and must show up to work., That is correct, the Senate aide said, but the employees would be required to work without pay., In the meantime, applications will start being accepted Feb. 18 for the start of Obamas new program for immigrants - an expansion of DACA to provide deportation relief and work permits for those who came to the U.S. illegally before they were 16., Because Obamas program is largely funded by fees the immigrants will pay as they apply, it will not be halted by the stalemate in Congress., For the latest from Congress follow @LisaMascaro]", "Date": "20150202", "Title": "[Congress headed toward showdown over Homeland Security funding]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-na-homeland-security-20150202-story.html", "Author": "[Lisa Mascaro]"}
{"Content": "[[, Congress returns this week to a changed atmosphere after the Republican midterm election sweep  but before any new agenda is launched, old business must be finished., Lawmakers have just four weeks to approve must-pass bills to fund the government, extend business tax breaks and consider President Obamas requests for $6 billion in emergency funds for the fight against Ebola in West Africa and nearly as much to battle Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria., Lame-duck sessions can be oddly productive, especially when the party that just lost the election uses its final days in power to push last-ditch legislative priorities. Both Democrats and Republicans want to use this session to clear the way for the new Republican Congress in January., But achieving common ground can be elusive in the aftermath of a brutal election. Political wounds will be on display as newly elected members arrive to pick out office space and drapery colors, while just-defeated ones are relegated to makeshift desks, often in the basements of Capitol Hill., With emotions running high  leadership elections in the House and Senate also will be underway  finding bipartisan compromise can be tough., \"Theres going to be some specific work that has to get done during the next several weeks,\" Obama said before a Friday lunch with congressional leaders at the White House. \"And my hope ... is that even as we enter into a new Congress, the previous Congress has the opportunity still to make progress on a whole bunch of fronts, and Im confident we can get that done.\", A top order of business for Democrats before they relinquish control of the Senate to Republicans will be the speedy confirmation of Obamas remaining nominees for judicial and executive branch posts. That doesnt include his new pick for attorney general, U.S. Atty. Loretta Lynch, whose path to confirmation is complicated by whether a Senate vote to approve her will be taken before or after Republicans take control of the chamber. It is likely to push into the new year., Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) quickened the pace of judicial confirmations after changing the rules last year to bypass Republican filibusters. Knowing that Republicans probably will be less inclined to support Obamas nominees once in charge, Democrats will try to finish the job., Obama also wants Congress to step into the foreign policy debate. Lawmakers will be asked not only to continue arming Syrian rebels who are fighting Islamic State extremists  authority for that program expires in mid-December  but also to authorize the administrations use of military force against the group., The war powers debate is one that has stymied Congress, with lawmakers at first reluctant to wade into the politically difficult issue, then abruptly switching course and demanding that Obama seek their approval for airstrikes against militants., Obama also reversed course, first saying he had authority under the 2001 and 2002 congressional authorizations for the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. But even Democrats who backed him are insisting that Congress should vote., \"We should be doing it now,\" said Rep. Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco, the Democratic minority leader., House Speaker John A. Boehners office said Friday that \"House Republicans will be ready to work with him to get it approved.\" A final vote would not be expected until the new year., An undercurrent that could derail the lame-duck session will be Obamas planned executive action to allow up to 5 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally to stay without fear of deportation., Republicans warned the president at Fridays meeting that he would \"poison the well\" by going it alone on immigration policy. But they have been unwilling to commit to tackling the issue when they take control of Congress next year., If Obama moves ahead, conservative senators, including Texas Republican Ted Cruz, have pledged to use \"all procedural means necessary\" during the lame-duck session to stop what they view as executive overreach., That could gum up the effort required by Congress to fund the government beyond Dec. 11, when the current stopgap spending bill expires., Negotiators have been at work for months hammering out the details of a package that could keep the government running until the end of the fiscal year, Sept. 30., Spending levels were set by previous bipartisan budget accords, but some conservative lawmakers will resist sticking to that agreement when Republicans control Congress. They prefer a stopgap measure until the new Congress takes over., Congress is also debating a range of other issues that have stalled this session, such as expiring tax breaks for specialty businesses, including the film industry, and proposals for terrorism risk insurance and an Internet sales tax., \"Theres a whole lot of unfinished business sitting there, some of which it might be advantageous to get out of the way,\" said Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who is set to become the majority leader in the new Senate., One motivating factor for lawmakers to avoid lame-duck political drama and finish their work: Christmas and the winter holidays, which many hope to spend not in the chilly halls of the Capitol but with family and friends at home., lisa.mascaro@latimes.com, Twitter: @lisamascaro ]", "Date": "20141111", "Title": "[Lame-duck Congress faces a full agenda, and many obstacles]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-lameduck-congress-20141112-story.html", "Author": "[Lisa Mascaro]"}
{"Content": "[[, Congressional action to raise the minimum wage may have stalled, but a grass-roots campaign to lift basic pay is picking up steam at city halls and state legislatures  and probably heading to ballot boxes in the Bay Area., Cities nationwide, including San Diego and Seattle, are considering passing ordinances or facing ballot measures that would raise the minimum wage to $10 to $15 an hour, well above the federal rate of $7.25., The efforts mark an important strategic shift in the campaign to raise the minimum wage. Though efforts in Congress to boost the federal minimum wage to $10.10 havent died, they have faced fierce lobbying by opponents., So labor leaders and community advocates are instead turning their attention to cities and states that have the power to raise wages on a local level., \"Urban areas tend to be more sympathetic\" to raising the minimum wage, said Ken Jacobs, director of the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at UC Berkeley. \"What we have seen are cities and counties work as laboratories of democracy.\", On Friday, labor and progressive groups said they turned in enough signatures in Oakland to put an initiative on the November ballot to raise that citys minimum wage to $12.25 an hour., Organizers plan to do the same in nearby Berkeley and Richmond as they push the latest twist in their strategy of going local., Richmond had been on the verge of approving a hike this year to $12.30 an hour, but the local chamber of commerce slowed the process, arguing that the ordinance would kill jobs and force businesses to move., Such a boost in the minimum wage could raise living standards in the industrial city of 100,000, where nearly 1 in 5 of the predominantly minority residents live in poverty., Richmonds proposed ordinance now includes several exemptions  for waiters and other tipped workers, those under 18 and nonprofit employees. The last-minute changes have irked labor and community activists, sparking their decision to take the fight to the voters., They plan to seek signatures for a ballot measure this fall that would raise the minimum wage to $12.25 an hour by next spring, index the rate to rise with inflation and require employers to provide paid sick leave., Labor groups also plan a similar ballot initiative in Berkeley, even though its city council last week approved a minimum wage of $12.53 that would be phased in over two years. The rate, though, is below $15 an hour that activists were pursuing., \"In conversations with our community groups, we learned they werent happy with those watered-down versions,\" said Gary Jimenez, East Bay regional vice president for the Service Employees International Union, Local 1021. \"They took a look at our measure in Oakland and liked that.\", Just across the Bay, San Francisco is considering raising its $10.74 minimum wage to $15 an hour. Other California cities, including Davis and San Diego, are not far behind., Outside of the Golden State, Seattle and Las Cruces, N.M., also are poised to adopt higher basic pay levels. Connecticut in March voted to approve a $10.10 minimum wage, the same amount President Obama is seeking for the federal rate. Minnesota this month approved a $7.75 minimum wage, up 50 cents from the prior rate., The proposals at municipal levels allow for some customization, advocates said. A one-size-fits-all minimum wage  whether at the state or federal level  often falls short in cities with high costs of living, such as San Francisco., Organizers also are using ballot initiatives and targeting key cities, such as the Bay Areas three biggest Alameda County cities, to build momentum for raising base wages in broader metropolitan areas., \"It makes better policy,\" Jimenez said. \"At this point, it looks like our elected officials dont have the wherewithal to put that forward.... Were pretty confident the voters are going to do the right thing.\", In the minimum wage battle, proponents for a higher rate say a hike will help boost consumer spending, which is the biggest driver of the economy. Opponents say wage hikes would cause job losses as business owners look for ways to automate entry-level jobs., Nationally, polling by Gallup found that business support for a higher minimum wage was split. Americans overwhelmingly supported a higher rate, with 76% saying in November that they approved a minimum wage of $9 an hour., In Richmond, business owners initially seemed to support the idea of raising the minimum wage, but later reversed course. Richmond Councilman Tom Butt helped draft some of the changes to help soften the blow to businesses., \"While [the changes] may be attacked as weakening the protection of low-wage workers, significant job loss is the worst thing for low-wage workers,\" Butt wrote for the Richmond Standard, a local news site funded by Chevron Richmond, the refinery in the city., The California Restaurant Assn., one of the trade groups that oppose minimum wage hikes, cites a study that found that a hike in minimum wages would harm the local economy. The research came from the conservative Employment Policies Institute, a group led by a public relations executive with ties to the restaurant industry., \"Local efforts are amplifying,\" said Angie Pappas, a spokeswoman for the restaurant trade group. \"Richmond is not really considering the effect on businesses and jobs.\", Lifelong resident Lenora Brown, 58, said an increase would help her and others tremendously., \"Its way overdue,\" said Brown, who earns $8 an hour in a part-time job at a nonprofit organization., With higher pay, she said, she could finally begin to save enough money to buy a car instead of relying on public transportation to get to her job., Thats a far cry from the steady work she had in customer service at Washington Mutual Bank. She lost her job after JPMorgan Chase & Co. acquired WaMu in 2008., Richmond Mayor Gayle McLaughlin, who was elected with the help of the Richmond Progressive Alliance, which supports a minimum wage increase, has spearheaded the minimum-wage effort. Three other Richmond council members won their seats with the groups backing., \"Richmond is saying loud and clear that we have suffered from years of social and economic injustice,\" said McLaughlin, who is running for a council seat after her mayoral term expires. \"Its not right.\", Mike Parker, editor for the alliances newsletter, hopes to succeed McLaughlin as mayor and holds similar views., \"Were proud that were leading the process, but we recognize that we live in a regional economy,\" he said. \"We want to see all the wages in the Bay Area move up to a living wage level.\", ricardo.lopez@latimes.com, Twitter: @rljourno]", "Date": "20140527", "Title": "[Focus of campaign to boost the minimum wage shifts to the local level]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-richmond-minimum-wage-20140527-story.html", "Author": "[Ricardo Lopez]"}
{"Content": "[[, Congressional Republicans on Wednesday warned that net neutrality regulations expected to be approved by the Federal Communications Commission will cause years of legal uncertainty for the Internet and that the GOPs more restrained legislation on the contentious issue was the best way to address the issue., What the FCC is most likely going to vote on tomorrow is net nonsense, said Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas). Its not going to work. It is going to be tested in court, and its going to fail in court., But some experts testifying at a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing Wednesday said it probably would be at least three years before federal judges ruled on telecommunications companies promised challenges to the regulations., That lengthy period could harm investment in expanding broadband networks and put net neutrality protections at risk because the FCC could be controlled by Republicans after the 2016 election., Im concernedthat if Congress does not act, all protection for network neutrality is at risk of being lost, said Rick Boucher, a former Democratic congressman from Virginia who now chairs a telecomindustry trade group called the Internet Industry Alliance., FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has proposed tough rules for online traffic, including prohibiting broadband providers from charging websites for faster delivery of their content, that depend on classifyingbroadband Internet service as a more highly regulated service under telecommunications law., The move would put broadband in the same utility-like legal category as conventional phone companies, reversing an FCC decision in 2002 classifying it as a more lightly regulated information service., Wheeler and supporters of his plan said the move would provide the best strategy to ensure thatthe rules are not tossed out in court., Twice before, FCC net neutrality rules have been overturned after industry lawsuits. The most recent ruling, in January 2014, said the FCC overstepped its authority by trying to treat Internet service providers as more highly regulated utilities even though the agency hadnt classified them that way., With the Democratic-controlled FCC set to approve Wheelers proposal on a party line 3-2 vote, Republicans said their proposed legislation was a better solution that would ensure basic net neutrality protections but avoid the risks of more expansive agency authority., A legislative answer to the net neutrality question will finally put to rest years of litigation and uncertainty, said Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.)., Upton, Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) and Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) have introduced legislation that would prohibit the practices Wheeler has targeted, including paid prioritization of content, but without giving the FCC the broader authority over Internet service providers contained in his proposal., The legislation would clarify the FCCs authority and avoid legal challenges asserting the agency is overstepping its bounds., The bill is a major concession by Republicans, who for years resisted calls for net neutrality rules because they said they were not needed., But Democrats have dismissed the legislation, saying it would limit the FCCs ability to police the Internet for abuses, and have describedWheelers planas the best approach., I really dont think we should be deciding what to do here based on who we think is going to sue who, said Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), who noted Republicans traditionally havewanted to limit the ability of people to file lawsuits., The Republicans appear to be more litigious these days than our side of the aisle, he said, pointing to recent GOP legal challenges of President Obamas policies., Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Atherton), said the Republican net neutrality bill has a distance to go before it can attractDemocraticsupport., She and other Democrats said it was time for the FCC to act., The country has waited long enough, said Rep. Yvette Clark (D-N.Y.)., The hearing gave lawmakers one last chance to weigh in on the contentious net neutrality issue beforethe FCC vote., Asecond hearing on the topic by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which also was scheduled for Wednesday, was postponed because Wheeler declined to appear., Rep. Jason Chaffetz, (R-Utah), chairman of the Oversight committee, had asked Wheeler to testify about the relationship between the FCC and the White House., \"As Chairman Wheeler pushes forward with plans to regulate the Internet, he still refuses to directly answer growing concerns about how the rules were developed, how they are structured and how they will stand up to judicial scrutiny,\" Chaffetz and Upton said in a statement Wednesday., \"After hearing from over 4 million Americans on such an important topic to our economic and cultural future, its striking that when Congress seeks transparency, Chairman Wheeler opts against it,\" the lawmakers said., The FCC said the majority of the 4 million public comments received by the agency urged it to take the tough steps Wheeler is proposing., In November, President Obama publicly urged the FCC to take that approach. An initial, less restrictive proposal last spring from Wheeler, a Democrat appointed by Obama, could have allowed broadband providers to charge websites for faster content delivery. Wheelers latest proposal closely tracks Obamas request., The Oversight committee and a Senate panel are investigating whether Obama administration officials improperly influenced Wheelers proposal.

{"Content": "[[, Costcos deal to replace American Express with Visa as its exclusive credit-card company highlights an economic principle that should surprise no one., Consumers benefit when a business uses its market power to negotiate lower prices and passes along the savings to customers., Conservatives have championed such market forces for decades, arguing that if government regulators just got out of the way of businesses, consumers would be the big winners., That is, unless were talking about drug prices., Medicare, the federal healthcare program, is prohibited by law from haggling with makers of prescription drugs over the prices paid by its 54 million beneficiaries., That bizarre stipulation was put in place in 2003 by the administration of former President George W. Bush. It was part of a sweeping plan for Medicare to cover prescription drugs., Republican lawmakers, backed by the powerful pharmaceutical industry, argued at the time that the private sector was in a better position to ensure fair pricing of prescription meds., In subsequent years, Republicans have repeatedly beaten back attempts by Democratic lawmakers to lift this prohibition., \"Private competition works,\" Sen. Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican and a principal author of the 2003 law, declared in 2007. \"The government has very little experience and a dismal track record figuring out what to pay for drugs.\", Sen. Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat who was then the Senate majority leader, had a prudent response to this sentiment., \"The Department of Veterans Affairs is able to negotiate for lower-priced drugs,\" he said. \"HMOs can negotiate. Wal-Mart can negotiate. Why in the world shouldnt Medicare be able to do that?\", Surely that had nothing to do with the almost $240,000 Grassley received from pharmaceutical interests in the 2002 election cycle, prior to his leadership role in drafting the Medicare legislation, according to the Center for Responsive Politics., He was the Senates No. 2 recipient of pharmaceutical-industry money that year, after New Jersey Democrat Sen. Robert Torricelli, who received about $302,000 before quitting amid unrelated allegations of ethical misconduct., And its probably just a coincidence that no industry spends more lobbying lawmakers than the drug industry. From 1998 to last year, the industry shelled out more than $3 billion, according to the center., The reality, of course, is that conservative politicians and their profit-minded business allies have subverted market forces to ensure that Americans pay some of the highest drug prices in the world., The United States spends almost $1,000 a person annually on prescription meds, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development., Thats about twice as much as the likes of Canada, Japan, Germany and France, which permit their state-run insurance plans to negotiate the best possible terms with drug companies., Now step back and admire the elegant simplicity of what Costco accomplished., The buy-it-by-the-pallet discount retailer has been in bed with AmEx for 16 years. It was a sweet deal for Costco members., The Costco AmEx card offered 3% cash back for gas purchases, 2% for restaurants and travel, and 1% back for everything else. There was no annual fee as long as you remained a Costco member., The retailer clearly believed that accounting for about 10% of all AmEx cards in circulation was a big deal and worthy of special consideration from American Express. Presumably that meant seeking a lower fee to process credit card transactions., But Costco wanted more than AmEx wanted to give up. Ken Chenault, the card issuers chief executive, said he was unable to come to terms with Costco \"that would have made economic sense\" for the company., \"Its not easy to see a long-standing partnership end,\" he told financial analysts. \"But when the numbers no longer add up, its the only sensible outcome.\", Visa crunched the numbers and reached a different conclusion. Few details of Visas agreement with Costco were released when the deal was announced Monday, but its a safe bet that Visa made an aggressive bid to top rivals MasterCard and Discover., Costcos relationship with AmEx ends March 31, 2016. The Costco-branded Visa card will be issued by Citigroup and will feature its own rewards. Other Visa cards, however, also will be accepted., Needless to say, this is how capitalism is supposed to work. Costcos arrangement with Citi and Visa is a win-win-win-win for the companies and consumers., Meantime, the 2003 Medicare drug program costs about $80 billion a year and is projected to cost twice that amount by 2022 as aging baby boomers place an increasing strain on health benefits., Medicaid, the insurance program for low-income people, is allowed to negotiate discounts for members. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if Medicare had the same bargaining power, it could save $116 billion over 10 years., Thats serious money, and its your money were talking about. These are taxpayer dollars at stake., But in the eyes of conservatives, a private company like Costco has more right than a government program like Medicare to reap the benefits of a free market., It makes no sense. And the biggest losers are the American people., David Lazarus column runs Tuesdays and Fridays. He also can be seen daily on KTLA-TV Channel 5 and followed on Twitter @Davidlaz.

{"Content": "[[, Could Taiwan have its first female president in 2016?, Taiwans chief opposition party on Wednesday nominated Tsai Ing-wen, a 58-year-old law scholar, as its candidate for the January presidential election, and opinion polls show the Cornell University Law School graduate who has sketched out a moderate stance toward mainland China as an early favorite in the race., Tsai advocates dialogue with Beijing, rather than pursuing formal independence for Taiwan as her Democratic Progressive Party did when it governed from 2000 to 2008. Still, if elected, she wants Beijing to treat the island of 23 million people as a separate entity, not part of China, when the two sides sit down for talks., She will not do something perceived as unnecessarily provocative, said Lai I-chung, the partys former China point person and now vice president of the Taiwan Think Tank. I dont think Taiwan independence will be her priority as a president., China has claimed sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan since the civil war of the 1940s, threatening to use force if the island declares de jure independence. Taiwan has long been regarded as a potential military flashpoint in Asia, but since the Nationalist Party took office in 2008, tension has eased as talks have built trust and allowed for the signing of 21 trade, tourism and investment agreements that have boosted the Taiwanese economy., But the Nationalists have increasingly been criticized as too cozy with the mainland and inattentive to domestic issues, and the party lost nine city and county elections in November. Tsais party won seven, a vote that analysts say foreshadows the January 2016 presidential election., Local media polls give Tsai a lead of at least 10 percentage points over two prospective Nationalist Party candidates, though that party has not made a nomination. Current President Ma Ying-jeou, also a Nationalist, must step down due to term limits., Former Democratic Progressive Party President Chen Shui-bian advocated formal Taiwan independence from China, and some senior party members still share his view., But the party said in a statement last week it would maintain the status quo in relations with China, meaning more development of relations and an effort to keep peace., Tsai was born in small town in southern Taiwan and received a law degree from National Taiwan University in 1978. She went on to Cornell University Law School and the London School of Economics for her PhD., The fluent English speaker taught in Taiwan until the Nationalist government of Lee Teng-hui, who irritated China with suggestions the two sides form a state-to-state relationship, hired her in the late 1980s for several government jobs. During Chens administration, she rose to the rank of vice premier in 2006., Fifteen years ago Tsai began taking leadership positions in the DPP, becoming chairwoman for the first time in 2008. In 2012, she ran as the first female nominee for the Taiwanese presidency but lost to Ma by a margin of 51% to 45%., Tsai would be the first woman to lead Taiwan. Voters elected a female vice president from 2000 to 2008 and have elected numerous female legislators., Tsai has struggled this year to make her China policies clear as voters want to know what deals she would sign and how she could establish dialogue with Beijing without agreeing to be treated as part of China, as Communist Party leaders in Beijing demand., Some of the tens of thousands of anti-Beijing activists who occupied Parliament last year to stop ratification of a service trade liberalization agreement with China would not say whether they will support her. They call the Nationalist governments engagement with China dangerous as long as Beijing aims to unify with a reluctant Taiwan., We think what shes come up with is not that clear, sort of opaque, said Lai Yu-fen, spokesperson for the Taipei activist group Black Island National Youth Front., Tsais party says it is calibrating its China policy with the U.S. government in mind. Scholars in Taipei believe Washington wants the two sides to get along but hopes Taiwan retains its autonomy to offset the mainlands increasing projection of power in Asia both militarily and economically., Its hard for even the mainland to know how to react, said Ross Feingold, Taipei-based senior advisor with American political risk manager DC International Advisory. She hasnt given us enough to really judge., Still, he said. Shes ahead in polls.

Grimm, a Republican who resigned from Congress after pleading guilty to federal tax evasion., In celebratory remarks Tuesday night, Donovan vowed to try to raise the employment rate, lower taxes on the middle class and reduce government spending. He also promised to fight Islamic extremism and voiced firm opposition to a nuclear deal with Iran., New Yorks 11th Congressional District would appear tailor-made for Donovan: Staten Island is a conservative borough that is home to many police officers and firefighters., But Donovan was on the receiving end of nationwide criticism for his handling of the Garner case. In November, a grand jury declined to indict New York Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo after he used what appeared to be a chokehold, a prohibited police tactic, to subdue Garner during an arrest in July. Medical examiners found Garners death to be a homicide and called the officers actions a major factor., Donovan told the Associated Press that he had to fight the misconception that he had control over the grand jurys decision., I always try to correct people when they say, You failed to get an indictment, he told the AP. That means that our goal should have been to get one. And our goal is to present fair and impartial evidence to 23 members of our community., Donovan also was criticized for releasing little information about the grand jury proceedings. In New York, only district attorneys or prosecutors can request the release of grand jury information. Donovan requested, and was granted permission, to release only the number of witnesses who testified and the type of evidence they reviewed., He did not ask for a release of witness transcripts, surveillance video or autopsy reports,a stark contrast to St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCullochs decision to release all the evidence presented to a grand jury that considered charges against Darren Wilson, the Ferguson, Mo., police officer who fatally shot Michael Brown., For more news, follow@JamesQueallyLAT and @raablauren on Twitter.]", "Date": "20150505", "Title": "[Dan Donovan, prosecutor in Eric Garner death case, wins House seat]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-dan-donovan-congress-20150505-story.html", "Author": "[James Queally, Lauren Raab]"}

The youngest eligible voters of 2016 were toddlers when Americas most prominent political power couple left the White House, and what Americans know about Clinton is increasingly defined by what stage of her career she was in when they first tuned in., For millennials -- and this is true of any cohort -- if they dont remember it, its ancient history, Lake said., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, And there are a lot of Hillary Clintons to remember. A constant presence on the national stage since her husband first ran for president nearly a quarter-century ago, Clinton has gone through several second acts: activist first lady and culture-war flashpoint, scorned wife, senator, jilted presidential primary front-runner, secretary of State and, again, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for president., For some who lived through the battles of Clintons first years on the national stage, the culture wars and personal controversies of the 1990s are integral to understanding who she is., The recent controversy surrounding her emails offers an example. Liberal media outlet Mother Jones dubbed it the return of the Clinton media persecution complex, harking back to the days of Whitewater and the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal. On the campaign trail, candidate and Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who voted for Bill Clintons impeachment, highlighted his fluency in Clinton-speak honed during the Lewinsky controversy., Young people, though, are more likely to know of then-White House intern Lewinsky as a vague childhood memory and pop-culture fixture -- refracted through Beyonce lyrics, \"Saturday Night Live\" skits and Lewinskys Vanity Fair cover last year -- rather than a trust-shattering national scandal that originated in the Oval Office., Brooke Wojdynski, 25, communications director for Young Democrats of America, said the scandal seemed significant to her while it unfolded primarily because of the teasing of her third-grade classmates, who took pleasure in mocking her for having a last name that rhymed with Lewinsky., I dont think we understood what was happening, she said., Republicans also realize the need to frame Clinton in ways young voters can connect to their own experiences., The whole thing of scandal is much harder to pin on her with first- and second-time voters, said Frank Luntz, a GOP strategist who helped counsel House Republicans through their battles with the Clintons in the 1990s. The 90s are as irrelevant to 20-somethings as the 1950s are to 50-somethings. If you didnt see it and you didnt hear it and you didnt live it, it doesnt matter., To some young voters, even Clintons marriage seems irrelevant to how they think of her, which is mostly as a presidential candidate or secretary of State., Most of her career that I followed has been when she was operating by herself and hes been kind of a background piece, said Marilis Dugas, a 21-year-old student at Clintons alma mater, Wellesley College. I dont have nearly as many associations of the two of them together., Strategically, the first generation of post-Lewinsky voters offers both opportunities and challenges for Clinton. Her campaign pointed to the plan to make higher education more affordable that she released Monday as a key part of their strategy for targeting younger voters. Clinton told reporters she would make the plan the centerpiece of her campaign., Opponents are already looking to mobilize generational gaps in how voters see Clinton. Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida labels her the candidate of yesterday and called her college affordability proposal outdated while noting he had more than $100,000 in student loans himself just four years ago., Supporters, meanwhile, hope she can capitalize on the above-the-fray image she cultivated ahead of her current run for office, perhaps best encapsulated by a now-famous image of her staring into her BlackBerry, expression obscured by large sunglasses, that bloomed into the \"Texts from Hillary\" meme., Everybody kind of looked at her as getting stuff done and she had transformed her image, said Stacy Lambe, the 30-year-old co-creator of the meme. We were riding on this cool factor. We only see her in this new era, so I think any preconceived notions that might have come out of her being first lady dont really apply to us., Among boomers, the Clintons contemporaries, a long history can inspire either intense opposition or loyalty. The couple burst onto the national stage as generational change-agents, becoming lightning rods for both sides of the debate about shifting cultural norms around gender and sex., Everything associated with the Clinton administration is wrapped up in the culture wars, in competing visions of American life, said Illinois State University associate professor Andrew Hartman, author of A War For the Soul of America: A History of the Culture Wars. They represented a lot of the changes that manifestly transformed American culture., The former first lady endeared herself to those who considered her a trailblazing feminist but inspired ire in those who saw the couple as complicit in a coarsening of the culture., For baby boomers, its very current, said Lake. They are the peers of the Clintons, and they went through it with them., Staff writer Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, Democrats have never been more confident that their chances of hanging onto the White House hinge on black voters, who helped tip key states toward President Obama  but they have never been less confident, it seems, about how to talk to them., The Black Lives Matter campaign is seeing to it that the rules they relied on for courting the vote no longer apply., The potent social media-driven movement, sparked in the aftermath of Florida teen Trayvon Martins 2012 shooting death and reignited in the racial unrest in response to the deaths of other unarmed African Americans at the hands of police over the last year, has 2016 contenders scrambling to adjust their strategies. The protesters involved are proving masterful at refocusing the spotlight. , Candidates who might otherwise have been complacent, given their high marks on legislative report cards from the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People and endorsements from an older generation of black leaders, have had to more directly confront uncomfortable questions of racial inequality and the mistreatment of blacks by the criminal justice system., We want to ensure that these candidates will actually deal with the issues that black people face, said Patrisse Cullors, a movement cofounder from Los Angeles. The reality is that its still not legal to be black in this country., The groups demands weighed heavily on discussions Friday at a major conference of the National Urban League in Fort Lauderdale, where candidates of both parties sparred over the best approach for improving the lives of African Americans. Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton dived deep into the challenges of being black in America and the structural racism embedded in the countrys culture and economy. Jeb Bush, a Florida Republican, tried to relate his conservative growth agenda to minority empowerment., Both heavyweights had found themselves pushed off balance by Black Lives Matter before the conference., The movement inserted itself into the race through a few well-timed and highly publicized confrontations with candidates  several of which exposed politicians tone-deafness on racial issues. Often it was through a simple impromptu action, during which activists would demand that candidates repeat the words Black lives matter., Many candidates flubbed it. Their frequent response that all lives matter was perceived by many blacks as a refusal to acknowledge the particular risks faced by those with black skin. Republicans generally pushed back, accusing the activists of stoking racial division., Bush emphasized to the Urban League convention that his economic plan would prove beneficial to urban communities., Four percent growth is more enterprise in urban areas, more people moving in, a higher tax base and more revenues  in other words, a better chance to save our cities, Bush said. We can do this as a country. We can grow at a pace that lifts up everybody, and there is no excuse for not trying., Democrats, in contrast, are aggressively positioning themselves as empathetic to the outrage into which Black Lives Matter has tapped. , They are reeducating themselves on how to talk to black voters. They are sending surrogates to meet with activists, shifting their rhetoric and  in some cases  issuing apologies. They fear more stumbles could erode the bloc of black voters that was key to Obamas victories in Florida, Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania., This is not just about statistics, as damning as they can be, Clinton said at the Urban League event. This is about Americans doing some soul-searching and holding ourselves to account., Cullors says the group wants candidates to address poverty, racial profiling by police, incarceration and homelessness., What we are seeing is a group of voters that are getting their political legs up under them and beginning to define what politics are going to be like for them post-Obama, said Cornell Belcher, who was a pollster for the Obama campaign. You will have a hard time getting to the White House as a Democrat without speaking to them and including them in your coalition., The activists at the forefront are sidestepping the usual brokers whom Democrats  especially white Democrats  go through to reach black voters., There is a sense that the traditional civil rights organizations have been far too cozy with whoever and not making clear enough demands, said Fredrick Cornelius Harris, director of the Center on African-American Politics and Society at Columbia University. They see these people as having failed them., Its a point of concern with some of the older groups, like the Urban League, which embrace the attention Black Lives Matter has managed to direct toward racial disparity and injustice but express frustration that their own work is overlooked., We have been talking police accountability since before these incidents occurred, Urban League President Marc Morial said of the events that spawned the Black Lives Matter movement., The new generation, though, is decidedly more confrontational., Until we hear from candidates, beyond just saying, Black lives matter  until we hear them really address how we are continuously cut out of the American democracy, were going to continue to shut debates down, Cullors vowed. Were going to continue to call elected officials out. I mean, weve tried to set up meetings with elected officials, weve tried to send them emails  it does not work., Now some candidates are going to them. Clintons director for black outreach was on hand when the activists gathered at their inaugural Movement for Black Lives Convening last weekend in Cleveland. The campaign said the aide was there to listen., The progressive grass-roots behemoth Democracy for America announced it was upending its advocacy model amid demands from the black activists that the overwhelmingly white group diversify and more aggressively confront racial injustice., The African American activists, though, remain unimpressed. They say the candidates fall back on tired talking points without delivering a concrete agenda., Sometimes this country wants to keep its head in the sand and say, We dont have race issues, said Pastor Karen Anderson of Ward Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Florissant, Mo., not far from where rioting took place in Ferguson after Michael Browns fatal shooting by a police officer last year. Anderson recently sat in on a round table Clinton held on racial justice., The movement is emerging as a force in electoral politics, despite the spontaneous nature of many of its actions and its loose structure. Black activists have more strongly emphasized elections in the aftermath of events in Ferguson, where they led a push to vote out local officials, and organizers with experience mobilizing voters are building coalitions around Black Lives Matter., The candidates are finding themselves constantly tested, even in states where there is little African American presence. Kareem Jordan, a criminal justice professor in Lowell, Mass., drove to Clintons town hall Tuesday in Nashua, N.H., where he was one of few blacks in an audience of 250. He questioned the candidate on mass incarceration., Clinton, who decried racism in sentencing and emphasized the need to build trust between police and local communities, provided an answer Jordan found mostly adequate, though a little vague., Jordan plans to vote for Clinton. But he says turning out the black vote the way Obama did is going to be tough for her. Its hard, he said, for whites to talk about racial justice issues in a way that blacks find genuine.

{"Content": "[[, Democrats have their problems: a lame-duck president whose popularity has slumped, just about zero chance of winning back the House, and a better-than-fair shot at losing the Senate as well. But Republicans were facing multiple sources of tension, in California and nationally, as they met this weekend at the state GOPs convention in Los Angeles., There was the overall split in the party between the strategies that have won success in midterm elections  satisfying the older, whiter, more religious party base  against the angles that the party must play to win presidential contests: to wit, broadening its reach to younger, more female and fewer white voters., Rand Paul, the Kentucky senator who is readying a presidential run, made a stab Saturday at trying to push the party in the latter direction. But when it came to specifics, he underscored contradictions in his argument that Democrats will be able to exploit were he, or anyone following his prescriptions for victory, to win the GOP nomination., In keeping with current GOP strategy, Paul did not so much as utter a word about the partys views on such combative issues as immigration reform or abortion rights, two threshold issues that have caused great numbers of Latinos, Asians and women to refuse to give a second glance to the partys candidates. (Nor, in an evening speech, did House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from Bakersfield.), Though he would not acknowledge so, Paul suggested that he would simply turn the page and shift to issues less freighted, such as NSA spying. (He also cited criminal justice reform, the presidents use of the military overseas and voting rights, two areas where his more libertarian proposals are controversial within the Republican Party.), Strains in his logic were perhaps most evident when it came to the NSA issue. Paul, who has long vented about the agencys reach into private communications, argued that there was a constitutional right to privacy., People say theres no right to privacy in the Constitution. Heres the thing about the Constitution.Your rights are infinite and they are unenumerated, he said. You do have a right to privacy because they didnt give the government the right to look at your cellphone., Republicans can forward a message that were the party that will defend your right to privacy and frankly the Democrats havent been, he said later, in an interview., His choice of words was striking, since the right to privacy has been the argument forwarded by abortion rights advocates against antiabortion Republicans like Paul, for decades now. The Roe vs. Wade decision rested on the expectation of privacy in the 14th Amendment. While Paul is citing a different amendment  the 4th  his argument puts him in the position of contending that cellphones deserve privacy but women do not., A similar conflict was inherent in his argument that Latinos and African Americans will side with the Republican Party if it shows up in Americas cities to pitch its case., High unemployment and poverty have plagued our nations big cities, he said. All these big cities are run by Democrats. We need to go to the cities and say to those who are living in poverty, or working class and struggling, that the Republican Party does care about them and has a message thats better., He also said that African Americans and Latinos would appreciate Republican support for loosened criminal penalties for drug crimes that have imprisoned many for lengthy terms., But that would require Latinos and African Americans to see those issues as more important than, say, immigration reform, which the party has blocked on Capitol Hill, and actions by Republican legislatures to disenfranchise certain voters, an act that in many areas affects black voters more than others and echoes the civil rights battles of the past., The difficulty in trying to square the partys existing policies, which are popular among its present base, with those that might attract additional voters has bedeviled a generation of Republicans. New York Rep. Jack Kemp made a career of campaigning in the inner city  he was raised in Los Angeles  but even he was at a loss to find GOP support for policies with appeal to nonwhite voters. Rep. Paul D. Ryan, a Kemp acolyte, recently has talked about broadening the party only to come under fire for a budget proposal that would cut programs most to the people the party says it wants to attract., Some of this is sleight of hand; nationally, Republicans often talk about attracting minority voters as a way of appealing to whites who had been leaning Democratic, just as a generation ago Democrats talked up welfare reform to gain back white moderates who had leaned toward Republicans., But the demographic shift toward younger, nonwhite voters is real. It has defeated Republican hopes of a resurgence in states like California and is moving inexorably toward complicating the partys standing in other states as well., In an interview Saturday, Paul brushed aside a question of how he could sell a right to privacy for cellphones but not women. His answer -- I think the biggest thing is attitude more than policy -- suggested that much of what voters can expect is a better-phrased version of the policies that are the province of the Republican Party he wants to leave behind., For a generation, California Republicans have argued that their problem in broadening the party isnt their message, its the messenger. As they have found to their detriment  and other parts of the country may in the future discover -- its often both., For political news and analysis, follow me on Twitter: @cathleendecker , ]", "Date": "20140921", "Title": "[GOP at an anxious crossroads: Who are the Republicans of the future?]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-republicans-future-demographic-challenge-20140921-story.html", "Author": "[Cathleen Decker]"}
{"Content": "[[, Democrats were once the party of the white working man  but that was a long time ago., In the 2012 presidential election, Barack Obama won only one-third of the votes of white working-class men, a modern-day low. Mitt Romney, who didnt seem much like a blue-collar guy, swept the votes of those working stiffs by a huge margin., In the 2014 congressional election, Democratic candidates did even worse, one of the main reasons they lost nine Senate seats and their Senate majority., That imbalance has tormented Democratic activists, who still see themselves as champions of the working class, the partys core identity for most of the last century., If Democrats cant figure out how to appeal to todays working-class voters, then they dont deserve to lead, said Stan Greenberg, a political strategist and pollster who helped Bill Clinton win the presidency in 1992., So theyve done polls and held conferences. Theyve launched a grass-roots campaign to connect with blue-collar workers who arent union members. White noncollege voters  which is how pollsters define working class  have become the Democratic Partys great white whale., That may seem like a silly hang-up in view of the conventional wisdom that Democrats have a virtual lock on the next few presidential elections by virtue of demographics., White men, after all, are a steadily shrinking piece of the electorate. When Ronald Reagan won the presidency in 1980, about one-third of all voters were white noncollege men. By 2012, their share was only about half as large: 17%., The groups that are growing  women, minorities, young people  tend to vote Democratic. The partys next nominee could still win the White House based mostly on their turnout; thats how Obama won his second term., But abandoning the hunt for white working-class men would make Democratic candidates vulnerable to any Republican candidate who could win a healthy share of minority voters, as George W. Bush did in 2000 and 2004. Equally important, because of the concentration of minority voters in urban districts, it would doom the Democrats to second place in congressional elections., So its a practical problem, not just a sentimental one., Almost by definition, identity politics is one source of the problem; some white noncollege voters have come to view Democrats as a party that cares about women and minorities more than it cares about them., I think this is where Democrats screw up, you know? former Sen. Jim Webb (D-Va.), who says he may run for president, told Yahoo News recently. I think that they have kind of unwittingly used this group, white working males, as a whipping post for a lot of their policies. And then when they react, they say theyre being racist., The biggest driver of white working-class disaffection, however, is clearly economic insecurity, combined with a sense that big government hasnt done much to stand up for the little guy., Poll after poll has shown that workers without college educations are more pessimistic than anyone else about the economic future. Thats only logical, since their job prospects have been worsening for decades., But theres a striking racial disconnect: White people are more pessimistic than minorities. When the Pew Research Center asked in 2012 whether they expected their children to enjoy a better standard of living, 56% of black and Latino respondents said yes, but only 41% of whites were optimistic., How do Democrats plan to get out of the hole theyre in? , Part of the answer is easy: Theyll adopt some version of Sen. Elizabeth Warrens economic populism. Theyll denounce the excesses of Wall Street and demand a better deal for the working class., That was the very first note Hillary Rodham Clinton sounded last week in Iowa. The deck is still stacked in favor of those already at the top, she said. Theres something wrong when CEOs make 300 times more than the typical worker.... And theres something wrong when hedge fund managers pay lower tax rates than nurses., But Greenberg has proposed adding another piece to the Democrats message: a more serious commitment to both campaign reform and a leaner, more efficient federal government  an updated version of Bill Clintons 1996 pledge that the era of big government is over., White working-class voters are skeptical of government and skeptical of Democrats, he told me last week. Theyre surprised to hear Democrats say they want to change politics and change government., That message, he said, is a precondition to reaching them on other issues., He noted that Hillary Clinton also called last week for outlawing campaign spending by undisclosed donors, even if that takes a constitutional amendment., Democrats dont expect to win a majority of white working-class voters next year  let alone white working-class men. But theyd like to stop their slide. And, of course, Republicans will compete for the same votes. Several potential GOP candidates have decried the stagnation of blue-collar wages  although, like the Democrats, they havent offered much yet in the way of detailed remedies., At least working-class voters will get plenty of rhetorical attention. That wont solve their problems  but they wont be able to complain that nobodys thinking about them anymore., doyle.mcmanus@latimes.com, Twitter: @doylemcmanus, Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinionandFacebook]", "Date": "20150418", "Title": "[Democrats' hunt for the white working-class male voter]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0419-mcmanus-whites-20150419-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, Democrats will sanction six presidential primary debates, the party announced Tuesday in a move welcomed by Hillary Rodham Clinton, the front-runner for its 2016 nomination., Clintons presence as the heavyweight with few challengers had led to speculation that the party might forgo debates altogether., Weve always believed that we would have a competitive primary process, and that debates would be an important part of that process, said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee., The debates, which will begin this fall and be held in some early primary and caucus states, stand to help Clintons potential challengers by offering opportunities to confront her directly and to build their public profile. For Clinton, there is less of abenefit politically: She could be forced to speak to issues that she would rather avoid staking out positions on because they give Republicans fodder to attack her. Still, on Tuesday, she seemed game to participate, though she was noncommittal as to how many debates she would attend., \"While GOP debates the same failed policies, Democrats will debate how to help families get ahead. Looking forward to a real conversation,\" she said on Twitter., Sen.

In a year as critical as 2016, exclusivity does no one any favors,\" Smith said in a statement., In 2008, with a much more competitive field, Democrats sanctioned six debates, but allowed candidates to take part in outside debates. That year, the candidates took part in more than 20., Republicans, who could see a presidential primary battle with nearly a dozen candidates, have sanctioned nine to 12 debates and also barred participants from appearing in outside debates. In 2012, the GOP debates dragged along and battered the partys eventual nominee, Mitt Romney, with hits that made him more vulnerable in the general election.,  Follow @kurtisalee and email kurtis.lee@latimes.com]", "Date": "20150505", "Title": "[As 2016 heavyweight, Hillary Rodham Clinton will debate challengers ]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-democrat-sanctioned-debates-20150505-story.html", "Author": "[Kurtis Lee]"}
{"Content": "[[, DENVER -- It turns out John Hickenlooper is not only a Democrat but mortal after all., The first-term Colorado governor enjoyed transcendent popularity in this purple state as he lightly wore his partisanship, pleasing businesses, riling environmentalists and generally avoiding the combustible issues that inflame party passions., \"Hicks brand was that he was above politics,\" said Colorado Colleges Tom Cronin, a longtime student of campaigns at the state and national levels., But governing has forced Hickenlooper to choose, and choosing has defined him in a way that could leave him politically vulnerable next year as he seeks a second term in what could be a difficult year for Democrats., If only Colorado Republicans could scare up a serious opponent., Democrats harbored years of pent-up desires when they captured full control of the Capitol last November, and their recently completed legislative session was like their Valhalla beneath Denvers gold dome. Among the items passed and signed into law by Hickenlooper were bills cracking down on guns, legalizing gay civil unions, enhancing labor rights, mandating new green-energy requirements, allowing in-state tuition and drivers licenses for immigrants in the country illegally, and putting forth a $1-billion tax hike to pay for education reform, subject to voter approval this November., Republicans cried overreach, to which Hickenlooper responded, \"Overreach implies that your ambitions exceed common sense. If you look at the list, its not an excessive agenda.\", Perhaps not in his estimation, but it certainly left no doubt where on the political spectrum the once-hard-to-pin down Hickenlooper stands., Worse politically was the governors widely disparaged handling of the death penalty case involving Nathan Dunlap., Dunlap faced execution in August for killing four people, a mother and three teenagers, in a 1993 rampage at a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant in Aurora. Dunlaps attorneys sought commutation of his sentence to life in prison without parole, saying the killer had been abused as a child and was mentally ill at the time of the slayings., After lengthy deliberation, Hickenlooper announced in May he would split the difference, sort of. He granted Dunlap a \"temporary reprieve,\" in effect ensuring he would stay alive at least through the end of Hickenloopers first term., Opponents of capital punishment were disappointed. Prosecutors and the families of Dunlaps victims were furious. To many observers, Hickenlooper did not seem thoughtful so much as weak and indecisive., Up to now his political career has been a charmed one, starting with his delightfully unconventional back story as a knockabout who founded a Denver brew pub and first gained wide notice fighting to preserve the name of the citys legendary Mile High Stadium. He served two well-regarded terms as Denver mayor before being elected governor in 2010., To the extent Hickenlooper is known nationally, it is mainly for his quirky campaign commercials -- one featured him showering, fully clothed, as he eschewed negative advertising -- andspeculation about a possible spot on the Democrats national ticket in 2016., Now, though, Republicans catch a whiff of opportunity., Declaring his outrage over the Dunlap decision, former congressman and one-time presidential hopeful Tom Tancredo announced he would run a second time against Hickenlooper, who beat him in 2010. Republican strategists, however, roll their eyes at the mere mention of Tancredos name, mindful that his heat-seeking statements on immigration and Islam, among other topics, thrill some conservatives but repel a great many other voters., While a recent poll by Connecticuts Quinnipiac University showed Hickenlooper and Tancredo running neck and neck, the survey offered, more than anything, a pair of cautionary lessons: on the dangers of relying on a single survey to gauge the political state of play, and on the wisdom of listening to local pollsters and campaign professionals who know their state best -- several of them dismissed the poll results out of hand., A second high-profile Republican mulling a 2014 bid for governor, Secretary of State Scott Gessler, was recently hit with a state ethics fine for misusing his offices discretionary fund -- hardly the most propitious launch to a campaign., A handful of others have also been mentioned as prospective gubernatorial candidates, but none of them is a top-shelf contender., There is a political adage so oldit could have come West via wagon train: You dont beat somebody with nobody, and right now Republicans seemingly have no one with the heft and credentials to beat Hickenlooper., Unless that changes, the governor seems a shoo-in for a second term, notwithstanding his recent signs of political mortality. He may not even break a sweat.,  mark.barabak@latimes.com Twitter: @markzbarabak ]", "Date": "20130624", "Title": "[Colorado's governor has Republicans sensing an opportunity]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-colorado-governor-reelection-20130621-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, Despite a presidential campaign pitched, in part, on a presumed appeal to younger voters, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) fares no better than other Republicans among those age 18 to 29, according to a new survey from Harvards Institute of Politics., The survey, the latest in a twice-a-year project to gauge the views of the millennial generation, found no front-runneramong the Republicans hoping to become the partys nominee for president. Paul received the support of 8% of those who said they were potential Republican primary voters. No candidate had more than 10% support. A much larger group, 36%, said they did not know whom they would back., Paul has frequently suggested that his positions on issues, including support for changing the nations marijuana laws and skepticism about overseas commitments, would help him attract younger voters who have spurned the GOP in recent elections. Though that may yet happen, it hasnt so far, the survey suggests., Further complicating Pauls path, younger Americans also appear to have grown somewhat more interventionist in their views of foreign affairs, the survey found., A majority of respondents, 57%, said they would support sending U.S. ground troops to take part in a military campaign against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. The share who said the U.S. should take the lead in solving international crises and conflicts has risen to more than one-third, up from about one-quarter, where it stood during the last two years., Whoever wins the GOP contest will have to contend with the fact that, overall, Republicans continue to lag well behind Democrats among those age 18 to 29., By 55%-40%, millennials in the survey said they prefer that a Democrat win the 2016 election. That 15-point gap is somewhat narrower than the 23-point margin by which President Obama won 18- to 29-year-olds in 2012, according to exit polls, but exceeds the 54%-45% edge that John Kerry had among young voters in the 2004 contest against President George W. Bush., The support for Democrats among younger Americans has less to do with generational differences than with race. The millennial generation is far more racially diverse than older age groups, and Democrats receive overwhelming support among blacks and Latinos age 18 to 29. Among whites in the millennial generation, Republicans have the edge, 53%-41%., As with the country as a whole, Obamas standing has improved somewhat among millennials. Overall, 50% of those surveyed said they approved of Obamas performance in office, up from 43% in November. Thats similar to recent findings of the population at large., Views of Obamas handling of the economy improved notably, from 36% approving in the fall to 47% now. Obama also received a sharp jump in approval among Latinos age 18 to 29, with his approval rating going from 49% in the fall to 65% now. In December, the president announced his plan to temporarily shield from deportation millions of people who came to the U.S. illegally, and several surveys have shown an increase in Latino support since then., The survey also indicated millennials remain optimistic about their prospects, despite concerns about the job market., Among those in the survey enrolled in college, nearly two-thirds said they thought it would be somewhat difficult for people in their class to find a permanent job after graduation., But among all 18- to 29-year-olds respondents, 41% said they expected to be better off than their parents, compared with only 13% who expected to be worse off. Those figures were slightly more optimistic than the poll found two years ago., The poll found a sharp split on the question of whether the U.S. justice system can treat people fairly, regardless of race. Just over one-third said they had not much confidence in the systems fairness, and an additional 14% said they had no confidence. Only 9% had a lot of confidence, while 40% said they had some., Blacks and Latinos were much more likely to say they had not much or no confidence than were whites. A majority, 55%, of whites said they had a lot or some confidence, compared with fewer than one-third of blacks and 44% of Latinos., Blacks overwhelmingly said they supported recent protests about killings of black men by police, while only slightly more than one-third of whites agreed., The survey was based on 3,034 interviews conducted using an online panel designed to mirror U.S. demographics.

{"Content": "[[, Despite optimistic talk from Democrats and Republicans about overhauling the tax code, General Electric Co. recently showed that corporate executives arent holding their breath for a bipartisan deal any time soon., GE said last week that as part of a major restructuring, it would bring back $36 billion in overseas cash and pay $6 billion in taxes to do it  even though changes long under discussion in Washington could have significantly reduced that tax bill., \"Its a clear indication that corporate America isnt waiting for D.C. to make the tax code any simpler,\" said Chris Krueger, a policy analyst at financial services firm Guggenheim Partners in Washington., Theres broad agreement the U.S. corporate tax rate, which at 35% is the highest among industrialized nations, needs to be lowered to make American companies more competitive with foreign firms and that loopholes need to be eliminated to make the code simpler and more fair., Given that President Obama and congressional Republican leaders want to show that they could work together in the aftermath of last falls elections, both sides have made a tax overhaul a top priority., The desire to find a way to lower the corporate tax rate also was fueled by a rash of so-called inversion maneuvers last year by U.S. companies to re-incorporate abroad to lower their tax bills., But the devil is in the details, and major differences remain in how to reform the code, particularly whether individual tax rates should be revised along with those paid by corporations., There isnt much time left to gain momentum., With elections looming again in 2016, its unlikely Congress could pass something as controversial as tax reform next year. And obstacles are mounting to getting anything passed this year., The two tax-writing committees in Congress are focused now on so-called fast-track trade legislation, another contentious issue that would speed a deal on a 12-nation Pacific Rim free trade agreement. Meantime, Republican presidential candidates have begun rolling out their own tax plans, further complicating the process., \"We really desperately need pro-growth tax reform, but that said, there are real political obstacles,\" said Caroline Harris, chief tax counsel for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \"We are very hopeful for more progress ... but youve got to be realistic.\", For multinational companies, loopholes and the ability to stash profits overseas help lower their overall tax rate to well below the 35% level. A study by the Government Accountability Office found that the average effective tax rate for profitable U.S. corporations was 16.6% in 2010., This week, politicians and officials at the White House and on congressional committees working on a tax overhaul said passing a bill still is possible this year., \"We very much stand ready and have continued to have discussions with members of both parties in Congress,\" said Jason Furman, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors. \"Its something the president would love to see done.\", The Senate Finance Committee has five bipartisan working groups tackling different aspects of tax reform, including soliciting input from businesses, advocacy groups and the public. The groups recommendations are due by the end of May., \"Hopefully well come up with some very, very good answers,\" said Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah)., But there are big hurdles., Obama wants to focus only on corporate taxes. He has proposed lowering the rate to 28% by closing loopholes and making other reforms. And he would try to lure companies to bring back some of the $2 trillion they are holding overseas by offering a one-time break on the tax rate on that money., Companies can defer paying U.S. taxes on foreign earnings by keeping them abroad. Obama would levy a lower tax rate  14%  on accumulated overseas cash and use the revenue raised to pay for new roads, bridges and other public infrastructure. Future foreign earnings would be taxed at 19%., Republicans want the U.S. corporate tax rate cut to 25% and firms to be free to bring back any foreign cash without paying U.S. taxes on it. The money already is taxed in the country where it is earned  usually at a much lower rate. Many nations reduced their rates to attract business., Republicans want to cut individual tax rates as well because many small entrepreneurs run their business revenue and expenses through their individual tax returns., \"Just because both sides use the term tax reform does not mean theyre talking about the same thing,\" Krueger said. \"Obama and the Republicans really are speaking different languages on it.\", He called tax reform \"the greatest legislative unicorn of them all\" and put the odds of its passage this year at less than 10%., The U.S. Chamber and the Business Roundtable, a trade group of chief executives of major U.S. companies, side with Republicans on the need to lower corporate and individual rates. Congressional GOP tax writers are pushing ahead with an overhaul that includes both, which may prove to be a major stumbling block to bipartisan agreement., \"We dont see eye-to-eye with the president. But Im hopeful we can find some common ground,\" said Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee., The disagreement over how to tax foreign earnings also is a major obstacle. Republicans want the U.S. to join most other nations in adopting an international system that would not tax money earned abroad., GE decided to bring back $36 billion in overseas cash as it sells the bulk of its GE Capital financing unit to focus on its industrial and manufacturing businesses. The company opted against waiting for tax reform., \"This deal has no impact on our desire for tax reform,\" said Seth Martin, a company spokesman., A competitive international system, he said, would \"encourage U.S. multinationals to pursue sales around the world and would make it easier for them to reinvest earnings at home, both of which we believe are good for the U.S. economy and U.S. employment.\", Like many U.S. multinational companies, GEs foreign operations have helped reduce its overall tax rate well below 35%. GEs effective tax rate was 10.3% last year and 4.2% in 2013. GE estimated its effective tax rate would rise to about 20% this year because of the additional tax bill., Harris said even if an overhaul isnt passed this year, starting a bill moving through Congress is a positive step in a process that has taken several years to finish in the past., \"There is the need for it to be done,\" she said. \"I dont think anybody thinks our tax code is working well for anybody.\", jim.puzzanghera@latimes.com]", "Date": "20150417", "Title": "[Big differences divide Democrats, GOP on overhauling U.S. tax code]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-tax-reform-20150418-story.html", "Author": "[Jim Puzzanghera]"}
{"Content": "[[, Despite promises that it wouldnt come to this, Congress and the White House are charging toward another government shutdown., The next fiscal crisis could come as soon as Oct. 1 unless a new government spending plan is approved. But with House members having left Wednesday for summer recess and senators soon to follow, that leaves only about 10 legislative days next month to fix the problem, and there are no viable solutions in sight., President Obama has signaled his intention to bust, once and for all, the severe 2011 spending caps known as sequestration. Hes vowed to reject any GOP-backed appropriation bills that increase government funding for the military without also boosting domestic programs important to Democrats such as Head Start for preschoolers., The Republican-controlled Congress is also digging in. Since taking control in January, GOP leaders had promised to run Congress responsibly and prevent another shutdown like the one in 2013, but their spending proposals are defying the presidents veto threat by bolstering defense accounts and leaving social-welfare programs to be slashed., The 2016 presidential race is compounding the problem., Several Republican senators vying for the party nomination are hoping to use the budget process to grab headlines and push their agendas, including Kentucky Sen. Rand Pauls campaign to defund Planned Parenthood and Texas Sen. Ted Cruzs attempt to stop the nuclear deal with Iran. House Republicans want to overturn Obamas immigration actions. Any such policy rider attached to a budget would be deal-breakers., Republican leaders are resigned to a showdown. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) on Wednesday allowed his majority to leave a day early for the long August recess, predicting Congress would have little choice next month but to pass a short-term budget extension to keep the government open. Well deal with it in September, he said., And its not just the budget. A major highway-funding program is on a temporary fix that runs out Oct. 29. And the nations debt ceiling will need to be lifted by late fall to avoid a damaging credit default., The confluence of these deadlines raises the prospects for an all-encompassing year-end accord that could resolve all or most of the issues, but it also increases the risk of a crisis; there has been no visible progress toward any big budget deal., We know its coming, said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), the majority whip. Were going to leave that fight until September, October, November, December., Obama, in a private meeting with Democrats at the White House in early July, called on the partys senators to filibuster the GOPs spending bills and prevent him from having to veto them. While many of the Republican bills have passed the House, they have not yet been put fully to the test in the Senate. Only a defense spending bill has come up for a Senate vote, and it was filibustered., Democrats are portraying Republicans as skirting their responsibilities, recalling the highly unpopular 16-day government shutdown in 2013 when Cruz led Republicans in a failed attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act., We know that Republicans are experienced in shutting down the government, said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). It has been clear for months that the only way Congress will arrive at a responsible budget is by Republicans and Democrats, Senate and House, sitting down together and finding a path forward. Now is the time to negotiate. Not in September, not in October  now., The fiscal impasse is infuriating to some lawmakers because it is preventable. It has been long understood that at the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, a fresh round of sequester cuts is due to take effect, cutting into virtually all areas of government spending., The cuts were reluctantly agreed to as a last-ditch solution to the 2011 budget impasse between Obama and Boehner after Republicans took control of the House. A subsequent bipartisan deal in 2013 staved off the most painful reductions until this fall, but lawmakers have waited until the last minute to address the problem., Thats the way everything around here works, said Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho). Its like a marriage or a business or anything else  money is always an issue. Republicans and Democrats are hard-wired differently when it comes to money., With new Republican majorities, the House and Senate passed budget blueprints this year, but the appropriation bills required to put those fiscal goals into action are nowhere near becoming law because of the parties differing priorities., Boehner was forced to halt consideration of his partys bills after the shooting of nine black churchgoers in South Carolina sparked a national debate over public displays of the Confederate battle flag. Southern-state Republicans tried to add protections for the flag to the spending bills, but other lawmakers objected., The speaker announced last week that the best option would be for Congress to pursue a stopgap resolution to keep the government running from Oct. 1 until a broader agreement could be reached., But even approving a temporary spending measure could prove difficult if lawmakers try to use it as a vehicle for other pursuits. Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.), a conservative lawmaker who often bucks Republican leadership, said passing a short-term measure was going to be really difficult without votes on other issues. And the longer the government shutdown threat lingers, the more it becomes tangled in other year-end deadlines., The Treasury Department has said that Congress will need to raise the nations debt limit to continue paying the bills  always a controversial vote for lawmakers in recent years, especially as the debt load now tops $18 trillion. At the same time, lawmakers face a vote next month on the multinational nuclear agreement with Iran, and in September they will host Pope Francis, who will be the first pontiff to address Congress., Asked what lawmakers were doing to avoid fiscal stalemate, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) blamed the minority party, saying that the Democrats want to shut the government down, but thats not the place were going., Pressed on whether there was a plan to prevent that outcome, McCarthy demurred.

But he also faced questions about his domestic political plans as the midterm election season begins heating up., Before leaving town last week, the Republican-led House approved funding to file a federal lawsuit expected to claim that the president has overstepped his constitutional limits by failing to enforce his healthcare law as it was written., Few experts think the lawsuit will survive judicial scrutiny, and few House Republicans actually want Obama to enforce his healthcare law. But Republican attacks on Obamas imperial presidency are likely to be a staple on the campaign trail., The president, who has mocked the threatened lawsuit as political chicanery, offered a more earnest defense of his executive decisions Wednesday. He acknowledged his legal limits., I never have a green light. Im bound by the Constitution. Im bound by separation of powers, Obama said. What I am consistently going to do, wherever I have the legal authorities ... Im going to seize those opportunities, Obama has said he plans to take executive actions to ease deportation of immigrants who are living in the country illegally, following up on his 2012 order to allow so-called Dreamers  immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children before 2007 and who have committed no crimes  to apply for deportation waivers., His administration now is exploring ways to expand that program to the Dreamers parents and perhaps others., Obama also said he is looking for ways to prevent U.S. corporations from shifting their headquarters overseas for tax purposes. The maneuver  called an inversion  is allowed under corporate tax law and is being employed with increasing frequency., On Wednesday, Obama called it not fair  not right., Obama has called on Congress to change the law soon. But he said hes not hopeful lawmakers will take up the issue. The Treasury Department is reviewing options to find a way to prevent the practice, he said., Inversion transactions allow U.S. companies to reincorporate overseas, either through a merger or purchase of a foreign entity, and thus avoid paying U.S. taxes on foreign earnings.

Barbara Boxers retirement, after reporters noted that Californias top trio of politicians  our two long-serving U.S. senators and our four-term governor are all well past 70 years old?, The trio has a combined age of 231., If you toss in U.S. Rep Nancy Pelosi, 74, the cumulative age rises to 305., In California, where youth worship is a major industry, its kind of a relief to see men and women working in high-profile jobs well past the traditional age of retirement., Golden State? How about Golden Girls State?, The 74-year-old Boxers decision has opened the field to various good-looking California whippersnappers -- former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, 61; Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, 50; and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, 47 -- whose aspirations to higher office have been stymied by the career longevity of their Democratic elders., A year ago, in a piece about the retirement of then-74-year-old Rep. Henry Waxman, my colleague Cathleen Decker explored the political aspect of the \"party gridlock\" that has kept a new generation of California politicians wondering when theyll get their closeups., Its all well and good to finally give the kids their shot, but Id like to suggest that our chronologically gifted politicians have done more in their sunset years than others have done in what is supposed to be their prime -- especially Feinstein and Brown., Lets start with Feinstein, the Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman, who turned 81 in June., Last month, after years of tussling with the CIA and the Obama administration, Feinstein decided to release the groundbreaking report that put the lie to claims that torture is an effective interrogation tool, or that torture led us to Osama bin Laden., It was an extraordinarily bold move, taken at a kind of now-or-never moment since Democrats are about to lose control of the Senate. Republicans on the committee, most of whom objected to the reports release, probably would have buried it faster than you can say enhanced interrogation technique., In that moment, Feinstein, a moderate whose hawkishness has often ticked off the progressive left, made what is arguably her most valuable and heroic contribution to her country. For that, she was vilified, and continues to be. But she did the right thing. And now we know exactly what was done in our name, and why it was so wrong., Read the report, said said during her Washington press conference, and you tell me if you think this is how you want the country to behave., Boxer, who has long rankled conservatives because she has been such a pugnaciously liberal voice, has been a steadfast supporter of womens rights, abortion rights, gun control and environmental protections. To her enduring credit, she voted in 2002 against authorizing the war in Iraq., Three years later, she spoke for many who opposed the war when she challenged Secretary of State nominee Condoleezza Rice at her confirmation hearing, telling Rice that her loyalty to the mission you were given, to sell this war, overwhelmed your respect for the truth.\", After easily trouncing Republican U.S. Senate candidate Carly Fiorina in 2010, its pretty clear the Senate seat was Boxers to keep as long as she wanted., Californias enlightened voters do not hold a candidates age against her. Or him., Brown, 76, also seems to improve with age., In May 2013, about halfway through his third term, the Atlantics James Fallows took note of the governors vitality: He moves, talks, reacts, and laughs like someone who is in no mood, and feels no need, to slow down. He is nearly a decade older than Bill Clinton but comes across as younger and bouncier., And while Brown has never lacked confidence, his string of political victories in the last few years have imbued him with the kind of political glow that leads ordinarily cynical reporters to speculate about what his next political move will be., On Friday, Jerry Roberts and Phil Trounstine of the Calbuzz blog suggested that Brown, who theyve dubbed \"Governor Gandalf\" could replace Boxer., His good genes plus good exercise and diet habits, would make the age issue a non-starter for him,\" they wrote., Some have even urged him to run for president again., If he did, hed almost certainly be the oldest candidate in the race -- older even than Joe Biden, 72, and Bernie Sanders, 73. How fun would those debates be?, Maybe Brown could even recycle that great line delivered by President Reagan during a presidential debate with 56-year-old Walter Mondale in 1984., \"I will not make age an issue of this campaign,\" said Reagan, 73. \"I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponents youth and inexperience.\", Please follow me on Twitter: @robinabcarian]", "Date": "20150110", "Title": "[The older the better; let's hear it for California's geriatric pols! ]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/abcarian/la-me-ra-old-california-politicians-20150109-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, Diplomats from Iran and six world powers completed what may be their final negotiating session after two years of talks Sunday amid signs that a comprehensive deal to keep Iran from building a nuclear bomb for at least a decade will be announced Monday., After 16 days of bargaining, top officials from the United States and five other world powers that have been negotiating with Iran met Sunday evening for a working dinner that lasted just over three hours. Before the meeting, diplomats said the foreign ministers were aiming to nail down the precise language of the agreement and of the United Nations Security Council resolution that will lay out its terms., The head of Irans nuclear agency, Ali Akbar Salehi, was quoted by an Iranian news agency as saying that technical discussions are almost over, and the text regarding the technical issues with their annexes is almost finished., Earlier in the day, diplomats said that if negotiators completed their work here, the lengthy final text of the deal would be sent to Washington and Tehran for a final review, with the expectation that the terms would be publicly revealed Monday, unless the talks hit a snag., We are working hard, but a deal tonight is simply logistically impossible, said Alireza Miryousefi, a senior Iranian official at the talks. This is a 100-page document, after all., But although the comments from all sides were optimistic throughout the day, the nuclear negotiations have hit last-minute roadblocks in the past, and officials from the U.S. and Iran cautioned that a deal was not yet certain., Secretary of State John F. Kerry and French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius emphasized in public comments earlier Sunday that difficult decisions remained. Fabius described Sundays meetings as the final stage of talks., Negotiators have failed to meet two deadlines in this round of talks and are facing a third deadline Monday night. If a deal is not reached, Kerry would be under strong political pressure to call at least a temporary halt in the negotiations., If a deal is reached, Congress would have 60 days to review it. The Republican majorities in both houses virtually guarantee that a resolution disapproving the deal will pass, probably in September. President Obama would be certain to veto any such move, and vote counters currently do not think that Congress would have the votes to override a veto. That means the deal would take effect and probably become a significant issue in the 2016 elections, with nearly all the Republican presidential hopefuls pledging to overturn it if elected., Iran, the United States, France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China have spent almost two years trying to work out a deal that would lift sanctions on Iran if it agrees to restrictions intended to prevent it from obtaining a nuclear bomb for 10 to 15 years. Such a deal could resolve, at least for the next decade or more, one of the worlds most worrisome security issues and could bring far-reaching changes in the Middle East., In April, the negotiators, meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, reached a preliminary agreement. Under it, Iran would mothball two-thirds of its newer high-speed centrifuges that enrich uranium, going from 19,000 devices to 6,104 older machines. It would reduce its stockpile of low-enriched uranium from 7,154 kilograms to 300 kilograms and not build any new facilities for enrichment for 15 years., Those limits, plus inspections to prevent Iran from using new, covert nuclear sites, would greatly restrain its ability to complete a bomb for at least a decade, U.S. and European officials said., Iran would be allowed to continue to enrich fuel, but only to a level useful for a commercial nuclear reactor producing electricity. It would be required to convert a reactor in Arak that was designed to produce plutonium, which can be used to fuel a nuclear bomb., In return, the U.S. and the other world powers would lift many of the economic sanctions that have strangled Irans economy., With those issues largely resolved, the final round of negotiations has focused on a few of the most difficult issues  what access international inspectors would have to Irans suspected nuclear sites, how quickly sanctions would be lifted and what procedures would be used to snap back sanctions if the U.S. and other countries decided Iran was cheating., Iran also insisted that the international embargo on its arms purchases be lifted., Even as they hashed out those issues, however, each side accused the other of trying to reopen issues that had been agreed upon earlier., The negotiators are believed to have settled on a process under which international inspectors will be able to obtain rapid, although not immediate, access to Iranian nuclear sites if they believe cheating has taken place., With those difficult issues under discussion, the process has often seemed close to a successful conclusion  and often close to collapse  in the last week. There were many indications Sunday that the process had swung back toward obtaining a deal., Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who has preferred to keep a distance from the laborious negotiations until decisions were needed, arrived in Vienna on Sunday afternoon., In Iran, Saeed Matazerulmahdi, chief of the Tehran police, announced that officers would provide security if Iranians wanted to celebrate., In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, long an opponent of the negotiations, warned again that the deal was a bad one. To illustrate the risk, he showed Israeli officials a video of President Clintons promises about the 1994 nuclear agreement with North Korea., Clinton promised at the time that the agreement was a good deal that would lead to the dismantling of Pyongyangs nuclear infrastructure. Instead, North Korea soon began violating the agreement and ejected international inspectors., U.S. officials say that the North Korea deal was completed with few safeguards, in part because American officials at the time thought the North Korean government was on the verge of collapse. In the Iran negotiations, by contrast, months have been spent on the verification and enforcement procedures., In Washington, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said that the nuclear agreement would be a hard sell for the administration and that the Senate probably would pass a resolution to disapprove it., Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said his main concern was that Iran would cheat by inches, avoiding any violations that would trigger renewed economic sanctions, but still progressing toward a nuclear weapon., Corker spoke on NBCs Meet the Press, and McConnell spoke on Fox News Sunday., Special correspondent Ramin Mostaghim in Tehran contributed to this report., For more on the Iran talks, follow @RichtPau., , 5:52 p.m.: Updated with details on what was agreed to in Lausanne and what the key issues were in the final round in Vienna., 1:44 p.m.: This story was updated with the completion of the Foreign Ministers working dinner., 8:17 a.m.: This story was updated with quotes from Sens.

The rise of Donald Trump on the right and Bernie Sanders on the left is proof that the countrys two major political parties have lost their grip on the nominating process. They can still provide two guaranteed spots on the ballot, for a self-identified \"Republican\" and a self-identified \"Democrat.\" But thats pretty much all., It wasnt too long ago that party bosses picked candidates at the national conventions, in proverbial smoke-filled backrooms. The two parties also controlled everything crucial for winning the presidency: The money needed to fund a campaign, and the organization needed to build support., Primaries and caucuses of course killed the conventions; for at least 35 years theyve been purely ceremonial. The 1976 GOP convention fight in which Ronald Reagan challenged President Ford for the nomination was the last time there was any suspense in the outcome for Republicans. Nothing dramatic has happened at a Democratic National Convention since 1980, when Sen. Edward M. Kennedy sought a change in party rules to open a challenge on the floor to President Carter., Lately, technological change has disrupted fundraising and networking as surely as the primary system disrupted the conventions., In the 2004 cycle, Howard Dean stunned the Democratic Party by using the still fairly primitive Internet to demolish the party record for fundraising  set by President Clinton in his 1996 reelection campaign  and communicate with supporters. (I was Deans campaign manager.), Yes, Dean failed. But four years later, Barack Obama succeeded using the same techniques: leveraging online fundraising and nascent social media to defeat the Democratic establishments chosen candidate, Hillary Rodham Clinton. He brought in more money  half a billion dollars from millions of Americans giving less than $100 each online  and attracted more volunteers than any party-backed pol before him., This campaign season, a combination of small-dollar giving over the Internet and \"super PAC\" funding is sustaining the largest Republican field in history. Long-shot candidates typically do not leave the field because they are low in the polls; they leave because they cant afford an airplane ticket to the next debate or the next state. But the Republican Party cant cut off Ted Cruzs tea party revenue stream or prevent Rand Paul from soliciting money over Twitter., The parties can also do nothing to stop disfavored candidates from attracting attention. On the Democratic side, Sanders is a self-avowed democratic-socialist and independent senator from Vermont who has never before run as a Democrat. Running for the Democratic nomination is just the easiest path to a spot on the ballot in the general election. The establishment may not like his style, but, with Internet buzz, who needs an endorsement from party regulars?, Candidates relying on and playing to the party establishment are failing, while candidates adept at breaking party norms are gaining ground or taking the lead. Thats in part because the parties loss of control over the nominating process has coincided with the decline in their brands. People are almost embarrassed to call themselves Democrats or Republicans, so even candidates avoid party labels and are instead building their own brands., Brand Sanders is rolling. The Democratic Party couldnt stop his money or kill the energy in his campaign if it tried; and if it did try, it would only help Sanders raise more money and generate even more energy., Likewise, the master of personal branding, Trump, is dominating the fight for the GOP nomination. The establishment can react in horror when he insults crucial constituencies , Latinos, women  but his supporters rush to defend him on social media and Trump goes up in the polls. Now Ben Carson is surging, riding word-of-mouth to join Trump as co-front-runner in Iowa., None of this is to say that the establishment candidates will lose in 2016, but whoever wins wont have the establishment to thank. Jeb Bush or Clinton or whoever will win on the strength of a personal brand. The party brands have run out of steam., The only thing surprising about this situation is that it seems to have come as such a surprise to party leaders. Somehow they have been blind to how vulnerable they are to insurgents, and even more blind to a successful third-party independent candidacy at some point soon. If any candidate surprises in Iowa or New Hampshire, he or she will have millions of dollars within hours and hundreds of thousands of volunteers signing up within days  and like it or not, that is something the parties can no longer stop., Some are comparing the 2016 campaign with a circus. This isnt a circus. This is just what it looks like when political parties lose power. Democratic and Republican leaders alike should prepare to be surprised., Joe Trippi is a Democratic strategist and media consultant who ran Howard Deans campaign for president and was a media advisor to Gov.

{"Content": "[[, Donald Trump arrived in Mobile, Ala., for his biggest rally yet in typically bombastic style: in a private jet that had just flown several laps around the football stadium where thousands of his supporters were waiting., Wearing a red baseball cap emblazoned with his campaign slogan -- \"Make America Great Again -- Trump entered the stadium Friday night asLynyrd Skynyrds Sweet Home Alabama boomed., In an energetic, if meandering speech, the businessman, reality television star and Republican presidential front-runnercriticized Americas leaders as stupid, complained about children born to immigrants in the country illegally, and bragged about his personal wealth. , He vowed that if elected president, he would put his business interests aside and devote his acumen to improving the lives of the American people. , \"I wont care about that company,\" Trump said. \"My whole energy, my whole being is going to be to make this country rich. In order to make this country great, I have to make it rich again., Dismissed at first as a long-shotcandidate, Trump has soared in the polls since declaring his candidacy in June. His off-the-cuff style and outspokencritiqueofthe Washington political establishment clearly resonated with many members of the crowd, who at one point interrupted him with chants of Trump and U.S.A., Trump, not known for his attention span in speeches, interrupted himself many times, at one pointto highlight a sign being waved in the audience and at anotherto point out a plane flying overhead., A recent telephone survey found a majority of likely Republican voters think Trump will be their partys nominee for president of the United States in 2016. A Rasmussen survey found 57% of likely Republican voters thought Trump was likely to be the partys nominee, while 25% thought it was very likely., Trump said he he was ready to capitalize on that momentum., Id like to have the election tomorrow, he said to laughter. I dont want to wait., He talked at length about illegal immigration, the issue that many believe has gotten him here., Trump began his speech by recitingthe namesof several victims of crimes committed by immigrants in the country illegally, and repeated his call to end birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to immigrants in the country without legal status., That policy, enshrinedin the 14th Amendment, encourages immigrants to enter the country unlawfully to have children, Trump said., He pointed out that many other countries have different policies. Were the only place just about thats stupid enough to do it, he said., Trump said 300,000 children each year are born to women in the country illegally. Those are children, he told the audience, that you have to take care of, we have to take care of., Several thousand people attended the rally at the University of South Alabamas football stadium. Althoughnot a typical primary campaign stop, Alabama is one of eight Southern states that will hold its presidential primary March 1, 2016., The crowd is believed to be the largest yet to turn out for a Republican presidential candidate., Still, the more than 40,000-seat stadium was far from full. , With considerable fanfare this week, Trumps campaign moved the rally from a smaller venue after it said it received more than 40,000 RSVPs. In recent days, Trump has bragged about the tens of thousands of supporters he said would come., Still, Trump did not seem disappointed by the turnout. He gleefully poked fun at his Republican rival Jeb Bush, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Carolyn Kennedy -- and at one point, his own hair., Gesturing to the darkening skies, Trumpmade a joke about his goldencoif, long the target of jokes., If it rains,\" Trump said, \"Ill take off my hat, and Ill prove once and for all that its mine.\"]", "Date": "20150821", "Title": "[Donald Trump tells Alabama crowd: 'I'd like to have the election tomorrow']", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-trump-alabama-20150821-story.html", "Author": "[Kate Linthicum]"}
{"Content": "[[, Donald Trump was the one taking flak Friday for appearing to condone a supporters inaccurate and anti-Muslim comments at a New Hampshire town hall, but the rest of the GOP field was taking note., Given the considerable share of Republican voters who tell pollsters they believe President Obama is Muslim and questions his birthplace, it may only be a matter of time before the other candidates find themselves in a similar spot., This is a defining moment for all of us, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said Friday on MSNBC.  At the end of the day, this is a defining moment for Mr. Trump. The man in that audience has to be put in his place by the person who is answering the question., I dont think it is going to be good for the Republican Party to elect somebody as their nominee, to make somebody the nominee, who doubts that President Obama was born in Hawaii., The birther strain in the partys base, which critics say feeds off a prejudice against Muslims, has caused problems for the Republican Party since Obama first ran for president. Democrats have used it to paint the whole party as racist and preoccupied with fringe conspiracies. Its reemergence comes as the party is already struggling with disparaging comments about Mexican immigrants made by Trump, the front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination., Although some prominent Republicans have publicly disavowed the theories over the years, others, including Trump, have validated the swirl of claims about the presidents birthplace and fed them with their own questioning or pointed silence., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, We have a problem in this country. Its called Muslims, an unidentified man said to Trump at a town hall in Rochester,N.H., onThursday night. You know our current president is one. You know hes not even an American., Trump appeared to nod. We need this question, he said, chuckling. This is the first question., When the man went on to inquire about training camps growing and asked When can we get rid of them? Trump only addressed that part of the question, saying: Were going to be looking at a lot of different things., The presidentis Christian and speaks often about his faith. He occasionally attends and contributes to St. Johns Episcopal Church across from the White House. He was born in Hawaii. His mother was a U.S. citizen from Kansas and his father was Kenyan., On Friday, Trump abruptly pulled out of a candidate forum in South Carolina, where heprobably wouldhave been asked about the exchange, citing a significant business transaction that was expected to close Thursday., The campaign declined to comment on the exchange, but Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said his decision to cancel the appearance in South Carolina had nothing to do with the encounter in New Hampshire., AlthoughGraham called on Trump to apologize on television, not all of Trumps rivals were as critical. Both New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said Friday that they would have handled the episode differently, but declined to criticize Trump., I dont know what Donald Trump heard, Huckabee told reporters at the California Republican Party Convention in Anaheim, where he was slated to speak., If Id have understood what the person said, I would have said, Look, there is no evidence whatsoever that Barack Obama is anything other that what he professes to be, which is a Christian. I take him at his word for that., Democrats were far less generous. In a tweet, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is seeking her partys nomination, called Trumps reaction disturbing and just plain wrong.\" On the stump on Friday, she told Trump to start acting like a president., The White House was more direct in linking such sentiments to the Republican Party., The people who hold these offensive views are part of Mr. Trumps base, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, noting that he has the biggest base of any Republican politician these days., A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner said Earnests comment had crossed the line., These types of disgusting, over-the-top attacks only divide Americans and make it that much harder to find common ground on the important issues facing our country, said Cory Fritz., AlthoughEarnests comment was politically motivated, there is some evidence that Republicans are more likely to acknowledge holding more negative views about Muslims. A Pew Research survey conducted last year found Republican and Republican-leaning respondents viewed Muslims more far more negatively than they viewed other religious groups, with the exception of atheists. Democrats and Democratic-leaning respondents said they held the least warm feelings about Mormons, although there was less difference in their feeling toward other groups., A less-recent Gallup study looked at data from 2007 through 2009 and found 50% of those who reported a great deal of prejudice toward Muslims identified as Republicans, while 17% identified as Democrats and 7% as independents., To be sure, it is difficult to determine whether these surveys are picking up a greater prevalence of prejudice among Republicans or just a greater willingness to acknowledge bias., On the question of the presidents religion and birthplace, the partisan divide is stark. In a CNN/ORC survey conducted this month, 43% of Republicans saidthey believe Obamais Muslim, compared with 29% of Americans overall. Among those who identified as Trump supporters, the number was 54%., Its not clear whether Trump would count himself in that group. But hehas continued to question the presidents birthplace, the issue that catapulted his political career four years ago. After demands from Trump and others, Obama in 2011 released his long-form birth certificate showing he was born in Hawaii., Asked in July whether he was still a birther, Trump said he no longer wants to focus on that topic., I dont know what the hell it was, but it doesnt matter, he said of the birth certificate. Honestly, I dont want to get into it., MORE IN POLITICS:, Sen.

{"Content": "[[, Donald Trump, as expected, stole the show at Thursdays Republican presidential debate. Less dramatic, but more profound, observers believe, was that Facebook co-sponsored the event with Fox News., The social networks high-profile participation spotlights a trend that has been building for years: the ascendancy of social media in electoral politics and the decreasing relevance of traditional television., Videos of Trump dissing people including Rosie ODonnell and his fellow candidates while calling politicians \"stupid\" quickly spread to millions of Facebook users and other social channels online, foreshadowing social medias critical role in the long road to Election Day., As the campaign season builds momentum, those posts will be accompanied by paid political video advertising, providing a healthy boost to the bottom line at Facebook, Snapchat and other social networks that stand to benefit from the new trend in campaign spending., \"It is becoming increasingly difficult for campaigns and political advertisers to reach audiences through traditional methods,\" said Brian Donahue, chief executive of Craft Media/Digital, a Washington, D.C., agency that does traditional and digital advertising for political campaigns. \"The most rapid area of growth is in digital and social media. It has been extremely effective.\", Social medias importance to political campaigning isnt new. Then-Sen. Barack Obama famously leveraged Facebook to help him win the presidency in 2008. About a third of a million more people showed up at the ballot box in the U.S. in 2010 after seeing a \"get out the vote\" message at the top of their news feed on Election Day, according to a UC San Diego-led study., But social media are getting even more influential. Social networks have ballooned since the last presidential election. Candidates are smarter about using them. The platforms are almost ubiquitous among millennials, who pundits believe could be key to winning the election., And as the use of online video has exploded in recent years, campaigners are beginning to combine the targeting power of rich data analytics with videos attention-getting emotional appeal, creating a hybrid form of campaigning tailor-made for the digital age. Many candidates are using the medium to project a more relatable image than what they put out over television ads., With social networks like Facebook, \"campaigns can reach the right slice of voters at the right time with the right message to direct the right outcome,\" Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said. The Menlo Park, Calif., firm doesnt release campaign ad spending figures., Traditional television ad spending will remain dominant  a record 24 million viewers tuned in for the debate  but its centrality has begun to wane. These days candidates are allotting more ad dollars than ever to digital platforms as they recognize the power of social media to connect with potential supporters., Online political spending is estimated to reach more than $1 billion in 2016, according to Borrell Associates, a research firm that monitors ad spending. In 2012, that figure was a mere $159 million., \"An entire wall of TVs blasting candidate-approved messages wont hold back the digital tsunami forever,\" said Corey Elliott, director of research at Borrell. \"In 2016, broadcast TV will still get about 1 out of every 2 political ad dollars, but by 2020, it will drop to almost 1 out of 3.\", Thursdays debate played out in a huge way on Facebook., The companys logo was predominantly displayed throughout the debate. More than 40,000 people responded via Facebook to Fox News call for candidate questions, and 7.5 million Facebook users in the U.S. made 20 million interactions in the form of posts, shares, likes and comments about the debate., \"Facebook is reasserting itself as the place where dialogue happens,\" said Jason Cieslak, Pacific Rim president at global branding firm Siegel+Gale., But rival social networks are also jostling to be part of the election conversation., This year, Snapchat hired Googles U.S. politics ad sales lead Rob Saliterman to make inroads with the political advertising community. The app on Thursday ran a handful of political ads, including one by a PAC supporting Ohio Gov. John Kasich and another from billionaire Tom Steyers NextGen Climate Action Committee., The Venice start-up also compiled a mix of photos and videos into a six-minute feature that included the landing of a plane with \"Trump\" emblazoned on it, Kasich eating a steak before the debate and sound bites from candidate interviews., Snapchat said it didnt yet have viewership figures to share for the feature, but tells advertisers that eight times more people in the U.S. from 13 to 34 view Snapchats overview of big events than watch similar programming on TV., Twitters government team has begun briefing candidates campaigns and political groups on how to use new tools to engage with specific audiences. One of these is the Tailored Audiences feature, which allows candidates to tailor tweets to specific ZIP Codes, ages and other demographic information, spokesman Nick Pacilio said., Samuel Popkin, professor of political science at UC San Diego, said digital advertising is a way for candidates to try to target as many people as possible in the medium they use most frequently. Social media in particular are especially important at this early point in the presidential campaign., \"This is when the people know the least about the candidates and you can plant relevant material.\", andrea.chang@latimes.com, Twitter: @byandreachang, samantha.masunaga@latimes.com, Twitter: @smasunaga, Times staff writer Paresh Dave contributed to this report.]", "Date": "20150808", "Title": "[ From Fox to Facebook: Campaign influence shifts toward social media]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-social-media-politics-20150808-story.html", "Author": "[Andrea Chang, Samantha Masunaga]"}
{"Content": "[[, Donald Trump, whose bombastic statements have shot him to the top of Republican presidential primary polls, mocked Sen. John McCains war record as a POW in Vietnam on Saturday, crossing a line that triggered condemnations from previously quiet GOP leaders and rivals., They used their strongest terms to date  calling Trumps comments slanderous, declaring him unfit for office, and asserting that the Republican Party has no tolerance for disparaging statements about combat veterans., The question now is whether Trump, who saw his campaign take off after broadly denouncing Mexicans who cross the border illegally as rapists and drug dealers, will remain popular with segments of the GOP base who revere military service, prisoners of war and the 2008 presidential nominees connection to both., Hes not a war hero, Trump said at the Family Leadership Summit in Ames, Iowa, in response to a question about McCain, who has sharply criticized Trumps withering comments on immigrants., Hes a war hero because he was captured. I like people that werent captured, OK? I hate to tell you. Hes a war hero because he was captured, OK? And I believe  perhaps hes a war hero. But right now, hes said some very bad things about a lot of people, Trump said., McCain, a Navy aviator during the Vietnam War, suffered several broken bones and spent more than five years as a prisoner in North Vietnam, including two years in solitary confinement, after his Skyhawk was shot down during a bombing mission over Hanoi in 1967., McCain, the son of the U.S. Navy commander in the Pacific at the time, refused North Vietnamese offers for an early release because Americans captured before him remained prisoners of war. He was released in 1973, and has served Arizona in the Senate since 1987. The Republican now heads the Senate Armed Services Committee., Trump received four student deferments from the draft between 1964 and 1968 and a medical deferment that kept him out of the military, according to reports published in 2011., For all the expressions of indignation, the dust-up inevitably was a reminder of Republican-backed attacks on combat medals awarded to John F. Kerry, the former senator, 2004 Democratic presidential nominee and now secretary of State, for his service in Vietnam. The attacks, which hurt Kerrys 2004 campaign, ultimately were discredited as untrue., Since announcing his campaign on June 16, Trump has lost numerous commercial endorsements and business deals due to his harsh comments about Mexican immigrants., His rhetoric has worried Republican leaders, who are trying to broaden the partys support among women and minorities, especially the growing number of Latino voters, before the 2016 election. In a Univision poll, 71% of Latinos surveyed had an unfavorable view of Trump., Some GOP candidates have refrained from criticizing Trump until now because many core conservatives, who vote heavily in Republican primaries, support him. A Fox News poll released Friday found 68% of GOP voters said Trump was basically right about immigration., But by appearing to attack military veterans and POWs, a more powerful constituency among conservatives and other voters, Trump may finally have given party leaders a chance to pop his balloon, which has been eclipsing other candidates., The Republican National Committee immediately denounced Trumps comments Saturday, saying there is no place in our party or our country for comments that disparage those who have served honorably., Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who had previously avoided discussing Trump, told reporters Saturday, I unequivocally denounce him, according to his campaign., Fellow leading candidates Sen. Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican whose parents were born in Cuba, and Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor whose wife is Mexican American, also criticized Trump., Enough with the slanderous attacks, Bush wrote on Twitter., Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry  who days ago condemned Trumps toxic mix of demagoguery and nonsense  on Saturday called upon him to end his campaign because of comments that have reached a new low in American politics., His attack on veterans make him unfit to be commander-in-chief of the U.S. armed forces, and he should immediately withdraw from the race for president, Perry said in a statement., Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said on Twitter that after Donald Trump spends six years in a POW camp, he can weigh in on John McCains service., Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was a notable exception, calling McCain a friend and hero on Twitter but adding, Donald Trump is a friend of mine., Trump has clashed verbally with McCain, who supported a comprehensive immigration overhaul that passed the Senate but died in the House. While on a campaign swing in Phoenix last week, Trump slammed McCain in his home state, violating normal rules of party politics., Ive supported John McCain, but hes very weak on immigration, Trump said. He also questioned whether McCain, who is up for reelection in 2016, would hold onto his Senate seat., I think he will probably lose if somebody runs against him for the Republican nomination, Trump said., McCain told the New Yorker that Trumps comments were very hurtful ... because what he did was he fired up the crazies., On Saturday, his daughter Meghan McCain said on Twitter that she was horrified and disgusted by Trumps latest comments: There are no words., noah.bierman@latimes.com, Times staff writer Kurtis Lee in Los Angeles contributed to this report., , 7:00 p.m.: This report has been revised throughout for additional details and for clarity., The original version of this article posted at12:22 p.m.]", "Date": "20150718", "Title": "[Donald Trump says John McCain 'not a war hero'; Republican rivals denounce him ]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-trump-mccain-20150718-story.html", "Author": "[Noah Bierman ]"}
{"Content": "[[, Donald Trumps visit to the Iowa State Fair was a spectacle. A mob of fans wanted a handshake or a photo  a tableau reminiscent of a Hollywood premiere, albeit with horse manure on a dirt path rather than movie stars on a red carpet., Rob Stutzman, a GOP consultant from Sacramento who happened to be in Des Moines, witnessed the scene and experienced flashbacks to the hordes his client, actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, encountered during his unlikely bid for California governor during the 2003 recall election., \"Its celebrity appeal,\" Stutzman said., The mens decades in the spotlight reveal similarities between what propelled the action star into the governors office in 2003, and the force pushing the business mogul to the top of the polls in the 2016 race for the GOP presidential nomination. (In a fitting bit of symmetry, it was announced Monday that Schwarzenegger would replace Trump on \"Celebrity Apprentice,\" an NBC reality show.), \"Both of them are very skilled at using their celebrity to attract public and media attention,\" said Dan Schnur, director of USCs Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics. \"The difference is Schwarzenegger used his celebrity to leverage interest in his policy agenda. Trump, on the other hand, uses outlandish policy statements to leverage interest in himself.\", They are wealthy celebrities, so universally branded that they are known by their first names., Schwarzenegger and Trump have a flair for theatrics that play well on the evening news. Some examples: Schwarzenegger dropped a 3,600-pound wrecking ball on an Oldsmobile Cutlass to protest the tripling of a state car tax. Trump offered children free rides on a helicopter emblazoned with his last name at the Iowa fair. On Tuesday in Los Angeles, he will raise money for a veterans group, using the battleship Iowa as a backdrop., The two are confident, unabashed and self-promotional., \"I knew I was a winner, I knew I was destined for great things,\" Schwarzenegger wrote in a 1977 biography., \"Sorry losers and haters, but my IQ is one of the highest  and you all know it! Please dont feel so stupid or insecure, its not your fault,\" Trump tweeted in 2013., Both tapped a vein of discontent among disaffected voters: Schwarzenegger won over Californians who were angry at the energy crisis that resulted in rolling blackouts, and those with a growing distrust of Sacramento politicians ability to handle the states mounting fiscal problems. Trump has the support of voters frustrated by the status quo in Washington, and afraid that the United States global dominance is fading., Both also displayed an immunity to controversy that would have felled other politicians. Schwarzenegger batted away preelection day stories by the Los Angeles Times that he groped and humiliated woman. Trump has been unscathed by repeated insulting remarks about immigrants, veterans and women., That doesnt mean that the two share identical political backgrounds or approached their campaigns the same way., Trump, who is now espousing traditional conservative views on issues such as abortion, was once a registered Democrat. Schwarzenegger became a Republican upon his arrival in the country in 1968 and remained one while working in Democrat-dominated Hollywood and despite marrying Maria Shriver, a member of the Kennedy family., Still, conservative Republicans were skeptical of Schwarzenegger because of his liberal views on social issues such as abortion. But the recall offered circumstances that gave Schwarzeneggers political aspirations a boost  no primary, a condensed 60-day campaign window, and a weak field of rivals., Focus groups conducted at the start of the race found that voters did not take Schwarzenegger seriously, said Darry Sragow, a veteran consultant who was advising Democrat John Garamendi at the time. But Schwarzenegger grew to be viewed as a strong leader, he said, partly because of how the actor developed as a candidate., Schwarzenegger spent the first half of the campaign doing intense homework about issues such as the states economy, energy problems and political reform opportunities, said Joe Rodota, the campaigns policy director. Policy specialists were flown in to hold discussions with the candidate., \"Somebody in the campaign team called it Schwarzenegger University,\" Rodota said., There is little indication Trump has taken this route. On the campaign trail, he offers broad policy strokes  building a wall on the Mexican border, bombing \"the hell\" out of Iraqi oil fields held by Islamic State  and boasts of his negotiating skills rather than delivering detailed plans., His campaign emphasizes that he does not prepare for the debates. Asked during an interview where he gets his military policy advice, Trump said by watching \"the shows.\" One of the men he later named as a \"go-to\" national security advisor said he had never discussed policy with Trump., GOP primary voters show little sign of minding, with an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Monday showing him leading the field with 33%., \"The hurdle an Arnold Schwarzenegger had to clear or a Donald Trump has to clear is the jump from being a lightning rod for totally disaffected voters to being taken seriously,\" Sragow said, and thats \"one that is not easy to make.\", seema.mehta@latimes.com]", "Date": "20150915", "Title": "[Trump and Schwarzenegger: A political comparison]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-trump-arnold-20150915-story.html", "Author": "[Seema Mehta]"}
{"Content": "[[, Dont despair, political junkies. Theres still going to be a vigorous debate in the Democratic presidential primary campaign  even though it wont really be about who the nominee should be. Unless she stumbles, Hillary Rodham Clinton seems to have the nomination pretty well sewn up., Instead, the debate will be about something just as important: what it means to be a Democrat in 2016 and what message the party should take into the general election fight., And, for all you heartbroken liberals, heres good news: In that debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is still a full-fledged player  not as a candidate but as an insistent voice in Clintons left ear., Warren, the heroine of the partys progressive wing, met with Clinton a few months ago to urge her to run a populist campaign., The senator outlined some of the policies shed like to see: an increase in Social Security benefits, a much higher minimum wage and stronger financial regulation to force big banks to get smaller., And one more request: Warren urged Clinton to distance herself from the Wall Street fat cats who she thinks have amassed too much influence in Democratic administrations, including both Bill Clintons and Barack Obamas., Warren didnt get a solid commitment, Im told, so shes a long way from giving her blessing to Clintons campaign., \"I want to see who else gets in this race, and I want to see what the issues are that they push,\" she said in a CNN interview last week., Theres no shortage of candidates for the Elizabeth Warren Challenge. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent socialist from Vermont, is likely to join the Democratic Party and announce his candidacy soon. Former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley has conspicuously sounded Warrens themes on visits to Iowa and New Hampshire. Former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb has tried to stake out populist ground to Warrens right, inveighing against a \"moneyed aristocracy\" but opposing higher income taxes. And former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee, a Republican-turned-Democrat, says he may run because he thinks Clinton is too hawkish on foreign policy., As candidates, they all look a bit Quixotic. (Actually, Don Quixote probably has higher name recognition.) But in policy terms, they represent serious Democratic alternatives to Clintonland., Increasing Social Security benefits has suddenly become a progressive touchstone after a decade of debate over trimming the program. Warren, Sanders and OMalley are in favor; Clinton hasnt taken a position., Breaking up big banks and restoring the Glass-Steagall Act, which limited commercial banks activities until Bill Clinton helped repeal it, is on the same wish list. Warren, Sanders and OMalley are in favor; Clinton hasnt taken a position., Warren, Sanders and OMalley have said they oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a big trade pact that Obama hopes to pass this year. Clinton supported it as secretary of State., And Warren, Sanders and OMalley oppose the Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry oil from Canadas tar sands to the U.S. Gulf Coast. As secretary of State, Clinton said she was \"inclined\" to approve the project, but more recently she has refused to take a position., On foreign policy, Clinton faces a different set of challenges. Shes long been more hawkish than Obama; she initially supported the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, only to acknowledge later that it was a mistake, and she urged the president to intervene more forcefully in Syria. (He didnt.) Webb and Chafee have both said they think shes too quick to call for military action. \"Anybody who voted for the Iraq war should not be president,\" Chafee told Politico last week., Thats a range of views almost as diverse as in the bustling Republican campaign., While we dont know how things will shake out, the results matter. At stake is whether the Democratic nominee will continue in the center-left \"New Democratic\" tradition of Bill Clinton, the slightly more liberal vein of Barack Obama, or move further to the populist left., Clinton already knows what she thinks about most of those issues, of course; shes been in politics a long time. But shes avoided taking precise positions, a way of keeping her options open to see how the campaign develops. That cant last. Its not just pesky reporters who will be asking her questions; as soon as she starts talking with ordinary Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire, whose voters are among the best informed in the country, theyre going to demand to know where she stands., Like many pundits, Ive written that it would be good for Clinton to have real debates with capable sparring partners, under the theory that she needs a tune-up before taking on the GOP nominee. Almost every professional campaign strategist Ive talked with says thats nuts. For a front-runner, they say, debates are mostly an opportunity to commit gaffes and lose support., But Clinton says shes going to work for every vote; shes not going to make the mistake she made in 2008, when she behaved as if she were the inescapable nominee. She needs to prove herself., In any case, primaries arent only about choosing a candidate. Equally important, theyre about refining the ideas that the nominee will take into the general election  and, if she wins, into the White House., doyle.mcmanus@latimes.com , Twitter: @doylemcmanus, Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinionandFacebook]", "Date": "20150414", "Title": "[ What are the Democrats' alternatives to Clintonland?]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0415-mcmanus-dems-20150415-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, Dont know about anyone else, but my eyes glaze and ears go mute whenever theres media speculation about the looming presidential race. Thats because as a Californian, my opinion doesnt mean squat., My vote will be meaningless. It cant be cast until the June 2016 California primary, long after the nominating contests will have been decided by other states, too many of them pampered peewees. Thats just how it has been for about the last 40 years., Typically, a candidate breaks ahead of the pack, then increases the lead and becomes a speeding train. Politicians, donors and voters scamper aboard. Money dries up for challengers., And in the November general election, well, forget it. California is a virtual cinch to cast most of its votes for the Democrat, no matter who it is. And because of the ludicrously outdated winner-take-all Electoral College system, any vote cast for the Republican will be worthless., So California voters again will be watching from the nosebleed seats. We may as well be living in Guam, rather than the most populous state with the worlds eighth largest economy., Its too late to do anything about the November election. Theres a struggling national movement, which California government supports, to finally junk the Electoral College and elect the president based on who most Americans vote for across the country. Hardly a radical idea. But that wont happen for a while, if ever., We could, however, return to holding an earlier presidential primary. The Legislature and Gov. Jerry Brown could do that for next year., California tried early primaries in four presidential elections starting in 1996. It was a mixed bag. Usually, the nominations were all but nailed down before we voted., In 2008, California did rescue Hillary Rodham Clintons presidential candidacy by delivering a timely victory on Super Tuesday, Feb. 5, that kept her breathing for three more months. In the Republican primary, California all but clinched the nomination for John McCain., In 2012, we went back to our historic June primary, and California played no role in the nominating process. It would have been an ideal year for us to hold an early primary because the GOP contest dragged on longer than expected. Nationally, Republican voters werent at all excited about Mitt Romney, the eventual winner., But Brown and the Democratic-controlled Legislature decided to combine presidential balloting with the regular state primary in June. The majority party could not have cared less about a presidential primary, because President Obama was not being challenged for renomination. And it didnt want the California GOP to get energized., That wasnt what Democrats said out loud, of course. They claimed to be saving money., The last early presidential primary in 2008, according to the secretary of states office, cost counties $94 million to conduct. Add on $4.2 million for the state cost of printing and mailing a voter information guide. Thats a roughly $98-million tab for democracy., Actually, the real waste of money is tallying presidential votes in June., I asked new Secretary of State Alex Padilla how he feels about perhaps reviving the early primary  which no one Im aware of is suggesting, candidly, except me. Padilla sees pluses and minuses., \"It is painful to watch national candidates come to California constantly for fundraising,\" he says, \"but when it comes to reaching out to voters, we read and hear all about them in Iowa and New Hampshire and North Carolina and Nevada. Not in California, the most populous state.\", \"I wouldnt say that makes us completely irrelevant,\" Padilla adds, \"but it certainly doesnt give us the voice we ought to have given our population.\", Ah, yes, the California ATM., If youre rich, you get coddled and charmed. Obama and Romney carried away $137.8 million from California donors in 2012 while spending virtually nothing here., Presidential candidates, Padilla says, \"ought to figure out how to pay attention to voters, too, not just checkbooks.\", The only reason theyd do that is if voters had any real impact on their political fates., \"The flip side of an early primary,\" Padilla continues, \"is not just the cost of a separate election, but voter fatigue.\" After voting in a presidential primary, the theory goes, people wouldnt bother to turn out for the state primary three months later., So? Their choice., In the early 2008 presidential primary, the turnout was about 58%. And, yes, it dropped off to 28% in the June state primary. But in the combined presidential and state primary in June 2012, the turnout was only 31%. And last Junes state primary drew a mere 25% turnout, even with all statewide offices on the ballot., Critics of early presidential primaries contend California never attained the clout it had expected., \"It doesnt work,\" says longtime political analyst Tony Quinn. \"It had no effect.\", But clout shouldnt be the principal goal. It should be giving Californians the opportunity to participate in nominating a president when their vote still matters, sometime in February or March., We should never return to early primaries that combine presidential and state elections. We had three. They made for ridiculously long state campaigns and mucked up the states political rhythm. But separate primaries make sense., An unexpected tax windfall is rolling into state coffers. A fraction of it should be spent on enhancing democracy., george.skelton@latimes.com, Twitter: @LATimesSkelton, ]", "Date": "20150409", "Title": "[ Let's schedule ourselves back into the presidential nominating process]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-cap-presidential-primary-20150409-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, During a turning point in the Republican debate Wednesday, Jeb Bush was asked about a charged comment Donald Trump made this summer about Bushs Mexican-born wife., Trump, who has repeatedly called Bush weak on immigration, had said in July that Bush has \"a soft spot for people from Mexico\" because of his wifes ancestry., Did Mr. Trump go too far? a debate moderator asked Bush last night., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, Bush, the former Florida governor, defended his wife, saying she loves this country as much as anybody in this room. Seemingly emboldened by the applause that followed, Bush went a step further., Go behind the scenes of the second GOP Presidential Snapchat-style with L.A.

Are we going to take the Reagan approach, the hopeful optimistic approach, the approach that says that, you come to our country legally, you pursue your dreams with a vengeance, you create opportunities for all of us? Or the Donald Trump approach -- the approach that says that everything is bad, that everything is coming to an end?, That divide on both rhetoric and policy has cleaved the Republican presidential field at least since Trump entered the race in June. The fight over immigration has damaged Republican hopes of improving their standing with Latinos, even as it may have energized at least some conservative white voters., Democrats have done their best to exploit the moment. On Thursday, the White House set out a new initiative aimed at the roughly 8.8 million legal permanent residents of the U.S. who are eligible for citizenship but have not sought it. The program is designed to make the process easier and less daunting for applicants., White House officials insisted the initiative was not politically motivated, but the political effect is clear: Most of the potential new citizens are Latino and could be expected to vote for Democrats if they become eligible., On the Republican side, Wednesday nights debate highlighted how divided the party remains, with Trump on one side and candidates including Bush, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina on the other, seeking to disassociate themselves to varying degrees from Trumps harsh view of immigration., In recent months, as Trump has risen in the polls with his calls to build a massive border fence and deny citizenship to babies born to people in the country illegally, Democrats and immigrant groups have accused the billionaire businessman of forcing his Republican competitors far to the right on immigration., NEWSLETTER:Get the best from our political teams delivered daily., After Bush used the controversial term anchor babies to describe children born to immigrants in the U.S. illegally, Democratic National Committee Chairwoman and Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said Bush was \"no better than Trump or the rest of the Republicans running for president.\" By invoking Reagan, who in 1986 granted amnesty to 3 million immigrants in the country illegally, Bush aligned himself with a view that is unpopular to a large segment of conservative primary voters but that could help him appeal to moderates -- and Latinos -- in a general election., Going into the debate, immigrant advocates launched a Twitter campaign calling on CNN and the candidates to tone down the rhetoric, urging people to tweet with the hashtag #NoHateDebate. Even former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele was urging his own partys candidates to be more inclusive, he told The Times., Perhaps in response to that demand -- but more likely in recognition of the increasingly important Latino vote -- several candidates flexed their independence on immigration., Carson, a retiredneurosurgeon, said he supported a guest worker program for certain immigrants in the country illegally, a view denounced as too moderate by some Republican hard-liners., See the most-read stories this hour >>, Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive, took jabs at Trumps repeated claims that Republicans would not even be talking about illegal immigration if Trump hadnt raised the issue., Immigration did not come up in 2016 because Mr. Trump brought it up, Fiorina said. We talked about it in 2012. We talked about it in 2008. We talked about it in 2004., Fiorina also criticized Trumps proposal to promptly and painlessly end birthright citizenship, a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution., The truth is, you cant just wave your hands and say the 14th Amendment is going to go away, Fiorina said., Bush and Rubio also used the debate to reach out explicitly to the record 28 million Latinos who will be eligible to vote in next years presidential election., After a moderator asked a question about Trump criticizing Bush for using Spanish on the campaign trail, Rubio, a Cuban American senator from Florida, jumped in., He talked about his grandfather, an immigrant from Cuba who spoke only Spanish., My grandfather instilled in me the belief that I was blessed to live in the one society in all of human history where even I, the son of a bartender and a maid, could aspire to have anything, and be anything that I was willing to work hard to achieve, Rubio said.

{"Content": "[[, Earlier than expected, there is a Biden-Clinton race underway  between Joe Biden and Bill Clinton, that is., In a year when an unpopular President Obama has been forced to scale back his campaigning to only the bluest states, former President Clinton has been the most visible and in-demand Democratic surrogate., Hillary Rodham Clinton has picked up the pace of late too, with her book tour behind her and a 2016 candidacy seemingly ahead., But the vice president quietly has kept up with  if not surpassed  the other Democratic luminaries, a fact that is all the more striking given the extent to which the partys candidates have tried to demonstrate independence from the administration., According to his offices tally, Biden  who has not said whether he would challenge Hillary Clinton for the 2016 Democratic nomination  has done more than 114 events for 66 different candidates, committees and parties., Biden has taken a personal interest in what might be viewed as a thankless endeavor, emerging as a patron saint of the embattled House Democrat., The vice president clearly revels in his time on the campaign trail., To follow Biden along a campaign rope line is to endure an endless number of selfie requests, bear hugs and kisses and close-talking. \"My turn! My turn!\" one giddy woman shouted to Biden as she got in position for a picture. \"Fire away!\" he answered., Biden predicts his party will perform better than expected Tuesday, but even the self-described \"White House optimist\" acknowledged the uphill fight. \"It feels better out there than it does in Washington,\" he said. \"But its still hard breaking through.\", Sunday marked the vice presidents final day on the campaign trail, headlining a pair of get-out-the-vote rallies for candidates locked in nail-biter races: incumbent Miami-area Rep. Joe Garcia and gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist., Each event targeted a key Democratic constituency the party needs to turn out Tuesday: Latinos and African Americans. And each highlighted the vice presidents predilection for going out of his way to make a connection to his audience., \"Its presumptuous for an Irish Catholic kid to come down and tell you this, but guess what? Your vote matters,\" Biden, introduced as Jose Biden, told the Miami audience. \"The contributions of the Hispanic community are already enormous. But the potential is absolutely immense.\", Later Biden headlined a \"Souls to the Polls\" event at the Mt. Hermon AME church in Fort Lauderdale, where he recalled his early days in politics in similar settings. \"I got started in the AME church. You think Im joking  Im not,\" he said, noting Delaware had the nations eighth-largest African American population., \"I got a simple, basic message for you, and a message from the president of the United States: Hes had your back. Youve got to get his back,\" he said., Even though Biden has traveled to some places the president has avoided, his presence still invites attacks. Republicans pounced, for instance, when Biden went to Iowa to campaign with Senate candidate Bruce Braley two weeks ago., \"Congressman Braley is teaming up with the gaffe-prone vice president to see who else they can offend,\" Iowa GOP spokesman Jahan Wilcox said, referring to some of Braleys own missteps. \"Between their offensive statements and jokes, its clear Iowans cant trust Congressman Braley or Vice President Biden to tackle the tough problems facing our country.\", Biden has done more of his work for Democrats in a behind-the-scenes capacity. As he travels the country on official business, hes also made a point of squeezing in quick grip-and-grin events for local candidates., The tally maintained by his office doesnt include other assistance hes given, particularly for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.), the committees chairman, said from an early stage Biden was helping recruit candidates, and then offering support in any way he could., \"There was no job that he was not interested in accepting,\" Israel said. \"Joe Biden just rolls up his sleeves, marches in and gets granular. Whenever I see him he wants to do a deep-dive into specific districts, candidates, media markets and polls.\", Bill Clinton has held more high-profile public events. A tally of his campaign activities maintained by the former presidents office includes more than three dozen public rallies this year, not including fundraisers., Hes also cut television ads for Democratic candidates and recorded automated phone messages  so-called robocalls  for 30 Democratic hopefuls., \"Every election season I feel like an old racehorse,\" Clinton said at a recent event in Kentucky. \"They come in and give me an extra bale of hay, somebody comes in and brushes my coat, then they drag me out to the track and they slap me on the rear to see if I can get around that track just one more time.\", For both men, the campaign work is primarily about increasing, or at least maintaining, the partys numbers in offices across the country. But there is obviously a potential payoff in 2016, either for Biden or Hillary Clinton., After the \"Souls to the Polls\" rally in Fort Lauderdale, Biden posed for pictures with a mix of local elected officials, volunteers and staff., \"I saw you out there in the audience  you looked like you were paying attention,\" Biden said to one, who quickly asked him about his 2016 plans., \"When am I going to announce?

{"Content": "[[, Edward Morfin, a 57-year-old maintenance worker, speaks fluent Spanish. His surname is common in Mexico., But when Donald Trump made headlines last month for saying that Mexico sends immigrants to this country who are criminals, including rapists, Morfin wasnt outraged  he was glad., \"Finally somebody got up there and said what needed to be said,\" said Morfin, who was relaxing on a recent night at an Albuquerque festival that featured cumbia and salsa bands and a parade of classic cars. \"He said what everybodys thinking but is afraid to say out loud.\", SIGN UPfor the free Todays Headlines newsletter >>, Morfin is hardly typical of Latino public opinion. Nationwide, nearly 80% of Latino voters consider Trumps comments offensive, according to a recent survey commissioned by Univision, the Spanish-language entertainment and news network., But his views highlight a reality thats often overlooked in political debate. Even on a topic as emotionally charged as immigration, Latino opinion spans a broad spectrum., Among the record 28 million Latinos who will be eligible to vote in next years presidential election are groups with distinct cultural and political identities, including Cuban immigrants in Florida and generations-old Latino families in New Mexico and Colorado, many of whom embrace conservative views on key issues., That complexity of opinion is one reason why Republican strategists hope that with the right candidate  and a little bit of luck  they can reverse the pattern of Latinos voting overwhelmingly for Democrats. In New Mexico, where Latinos make up more than 40% of voters  more than any other state  Latino Republicans have made considerable gains, even though the state voted for President Obama in the last two elections., Republican Gov. Susana Martinez has taken a hard line on immigration issues. Among her top priorities is to repeal a law that gave drivers licenses to immigrants who are in the country illegally. She has had the support of many Latinos, including a large percentage who trace their roots not to recent immigrants but to the Spanish explorers who settled here in the 16th century., ------------, FOR THE RECORD, 11:55 a.m.: An earlier version of this article stated that New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinezs grandfather came to the U.S. illegally. Martinez has said that in the past, but the Associated Press more recently discovered documents showing her grandfather came to the U.S. legally., ------------, Martinez and her lieutenant governor, another Latino Republican, have condemned Trumps comments, which she called \"horrible things to say about anyone or any culture.\", TRAIL GUIDE: Daily tour through the wilds of the 2016 presidential campaign >>, When Trump announced his presidential candidacy in June, he said: \"When Mexico sends its people, theyre not sending their best. ... Theyre bringing drugs. Theyre bringing crime. Theyre rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\", About two weeks later, Trump said he had been targeting the Mexican government, not its \"fabulous people.\", In an interview, Lt. Gov. John Sanchez said Trumps rhetoric was \"inaccurate and really divisive,\" but acknowledged that the comments might resonate with some Latinos., \"I dont think Hispanics respond in a monolithic way,\" Sanchez said, noting that some Latino immigrants who gained citizenship legally \"feel it is unfair that illegals would come here and cut the line.\", That diversity of views and limited polling make it hard to know whether Trumps comments have seriously damaged the GOPs standing among Latinos., For some, the remarks sparked fear of a growing anti-immigrant movement. In recent years, polls have shown that almost 3 out of 4 Latino voters believe an anti-Latino and anti-immigrant environment exists in the U.S. today., Albuquerque resident Teresa Guevara brushed off Trumps withering comments at first. A U.S. citizen who was born in Mexico, Guevara said many of her friends responded by making fun of Trump on Facebook., But her concern grew when she saw Trumps rise in the polls and the large crowds he was drawing to rallies, including one this month with Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, whom many Latinos see as anti-immigrant., \"Its scary, not just what he says, but in terms of people supporting that,\" said Guevara, who works for a nonprofit organization and who will be voting in her first presidential election next year., But whether reactions like that affect the GOP as a whole remains unknown., In the Univision survey that found large numbers taking offense at Trumps words, only 14% of Latino voters said his comments represented the views of the Republican Party, and 61% saying his comments represented only his own views., Gabriel Sanchez, a political scientist at the University of New Mexico, noted that the Republican brand had already been badly damaged among Latinos, especially those who favor a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally. In recent years, congressional Republicans have refused to take up an immigration overhaul bill favored by Democrats, saying increased border security must come first., \"Were at the basement in terms of the party brand among Latinos,\" Sanchez said. \"There isnt much lower to go.\", Republicans will probably need a large percentage of the Latino vote if they hope to win the White House. In 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney won nearly 6 in 10 white voters but lost the election because African Americans, Latinos, Asians and other racial minorities overwhelmingly voted for President Obama. Romney drew roughly 27% of the Latino vote, according to exit polls. With the country steadily growing less white, most Republican strategists believe their party needs to significantly improve on Romneys showing among Latinos to have a shot at the presidency., New Mexico Atty. Gen. Hector Balderas, a Democrat, said he didnt think the controversy around Trump was a death knell for Republicans. \"I think Latinos will evaluate each individual candidate on their merits and how they treat us,\" said Balderas, the son of a Mexican immigrant. \"I think the Latino community will be fair.\", Balderas said he, and many other Latinos, may be more offended by Trumps recent comments disputing the heroism of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who was held for more than five years as a North Vietnam prisoner of war and refused an early offer to be freed because other American prisoners had been held longer., \"This isnt the first time weve been disparaged,\" Balderas said. \"We may hold [Trump] more accountable for how he treats others.\", That was the view of David Vigil, 60, a retiree who said he is a registered independent.

On Tuesday, voters elected the most hostile Congress environmentalists have faced in years., The Republicans who won control are already making plans to roll back President Obamas signature emission reduction efforts, green-light the controversial Keystone XL pipeline that would transport Canadian tar sands oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast, and cancel subsidies for renewable energy., Steyer says he has no regrets., \"I feel great,\" he said by phone from his organizations San Francisco office. \"We set out to put climate on the ballot in a bunch of states, to build an organization and to build a relationship with a bunch of voters.\", He argued that all of that happened, pointing to hundreds of thousands of climate-minded voters newly enlisted in his organization, NextGen Climate, the emergence of global warming in the debate in several races, and the retreat by various GOP candidates from a platform of outright denial of climate science., He chalked up Tuesdays results to \"that part of the world we dont control.\" Steyer said there was no approach that would have overcome the Republican tide that gave the party control of Congress and defeated several of the candidates NextGen backed., But the election results raise new questions about the approach deep-pocketed, green-minded donors are taking toward electoral politics. Despite their best efforts, and the huge amount of money invested, they are failing to get voters to set aside other concerns and cast their ballots on environmental issues. This time out, the presidents record and the economy were the forefront issues, with all others receding., \"The take-away here is this was not a successful strategy,\" said Josh Freed, vice president for clean energy at Third Way, a group that seeks a middle path between the two warring parties. \"Candidate positions on climate do not move the overwhelming majority of voters to pull the lever for or against them. I hope these organizations take a step back and come up with a different approach.\", Steyers group saw its candidates victorious in U.S. Senate races in Michigan and New Hampshire, and in state legislative races, including in Oregon. But candidates they backed lost in hotly contested Senate races in Colorado and Iowa. NextGen also failed to unseat the governors of Florida and Maine, targeted by the organization for their outspoken skepticism of climate science., The unpopular GOP governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Corbett, which Steyers group campaigned against, lost. But even in that race  won by NextGens candidate, Democrat Tom Wolf  global warming hardly was a factor, according to G. Terry Madonna, who directs the Franklin & Marshall College Poll in Lancaster., Steyers impact was \"Zero. None. Zero,\" he said. Climate change \"was not an issue at all. It has literally no salience with voters. It didnt ever come up.\", University of New Hampshire pollster Andrew Smith said much the same with regard to the Senate race in his state, which Democratic incumbent Jeanne Shaheen won. \"I dont think anybody paid any attention to global warming this election,\" he said., In part that is because much of Steyers money was spent airing ads on issues his organization thought were more likely to turn out the Democratic faithful. But that too sometimes backfired., In Colorado, independent pollster Floyd Ciruli suggested Steyers heavy TV advertising, which seized on a Democratic theme emphasizing abortion rights, may have actually hurt Democratic Sen. Mark Udall, who lost to GOP Rep. Cory Gardner., \"It was probably a net negative,\" Ciruli said. \"It turned out to be one of those things that threw Udall on the defensive. He was being parodied and mocked for it and criticized for it.\", Even Steyers strategists acknowledge that climate change is not a top-tier issue now. The question is whether it ever will be. Advocates such as Freed say the push seems to be futile, and well-funded green political groups should shift their strategy to more narrowly focused efforts with bipartisan appeal. They might start, he said, by being more open to such GOP-favored options as nuclear energy., The green campaign efforts instead focus on getting Congress back to where it was in 2010, when it almost passed a California-style law that would have capped greenhouse gas emissions nationwide., NextGen officials say they are confident in their strategy  and persistent. \"This is a multi-cycle effort,\" said Chris Lehane, Steyers lead political strategist. \"If it was easy, it already would have been done.... Social change like this is not like switching on a light bulb.\", The GOP takeover of the Senate occurs as the science of climate change has grown more definitive and the predictions of widespread effects more detailed and dire. On Sunday, a panel of hundreds of climate scientists convened by the United Nations warned that climate change driven by the burning of fossil fuels was already affecting life on every continent and in the oceans and that the window was closing rapidly for governments to avert the worst damage expected later this century., Yet skepticism of climate science remains Republican orthodoxy. North Carolina Sen.-elect Thom Tillis said in a primary debate that climate change is not \"a fact.\" Sen. James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, who is expected to take the helm of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, has called climate change \"the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people\" and dismissed the U.N. science panel \"as a front for the environmental left.\", Obama moved to cut greenhouse gas emissions by issuing new rules for power plants and the nations vehicle fleet. The GOP-run Congress will not be able to nix the rules outright. But it could so thoroughly weaken or delay them through riders to key legislation that theyd be rendered ineffective, analysts said. Deeper cuts to the nations emissions would probably require congressional action, and the current GOP position on climate change makes such action improbable., Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune acknowledged there was a \"copious amount of bad news\" in Tuesdays election. But he says there was \"significant good news\" as well., \"Candidates who formerly denied climate science are now saying they are not scientists and instead talk about clean energy and associate themselves with it,\" he said., \"The money from Tom Steyer made a difference in elevating climate science and pushing all these lawmakers to move off a denial platform,\" Brune said., evan.halper@latimes.com, mark.barabak@latimes.com, Halper reported from New Orleans, Barabak from Los Angeles.

President Obama called the bonuses shameful., The public outrage continues, and now the Securities and Exchange Commission is taking another step to help shareholders decide whether to rein in executive pay., The SECs commissioners voted 3-2 on Wednesday to require publicly held companies to disclose in a clear manner more details about how executive pay compares to a companys total shareholder return; that is, the annual change in its stock price plus dividends., The data in many cases would provide the compensation and total-return data going back five years. Companies also would have to provide total-return data for firms in its industry or peer group., The proposed rules were mandated by the Dodd-Frank financial law that grew out of the 2008 crisis., A companys shareholders dont by themselves directly decide how much an executive is paid, information that companies already spell out in detail in annual proxy statements filed with the SEC., But investors can decide whether to push for bylaws curbing executive pay or whether to elect the directors who are on board committees that decide executive-pay matters., The SECs rules would give shareholders a new metric for assessing a companys executive compensation relative to its financial performance, SEC Chairwoman Mary Jo White said at Wednesdays meeting in Washington before voting to approve the proposal., Ahead of the meeting, the SEC said the rules also would provide greater transparency and allow shareholders to be better informed when they vote to elect directors or vote on executive compensation., Michael Hermsen, a former SEC lawyer who is now a partner with the law firm Mayer Brown in Chicago, said the proposed rules will crystallize some of the discussion among investors as to whether an executives pay is warranted., Its going to provide information in a very precise format, he said., But Hermsen and some others wondered whether a companys total shareholder return is the best measure against which to gauge executive-pay packages., Even White raised the question: Is total shareholder return the optimal measure of financial performance, as the rule proposes?, White said she was very interested in receiving public comment on the proposal  and potential alternatives to the proposed rules approved Wednesday., The proposal is subject to a public-comment period of 60 days, after which the SECs staff would make a renewed recommendation on the rules to the commissioners., Then a second vote by the commissioners is required before the rules take effect. So the rules might be in place by next years annual-meeting season in the spring., Gary Lutin, chairman of the Shareholder Forum, which provides information for investor decisions, said he was glad to see that chairwoman White encouraged debate about what would be the right performance measure., Using total shareholder return might provide a fairly uniform measure for the public, but the number might not always represent the true health of an underlying company, he and others said., For instance, a company that has gone through a merger using lots of debt might have a robust stock price for one year yet remain hobbled by the leverage over the long term, he said., Its important to shift the focus from current stock price, which is easily manipulated by all the wrong things, to a focus on operating performance that will encourage building sound companies, Lutin said., White said that during the public-comment period, she also wanted to hear how the rules would affect smaller publicly held firms. Those firms, whose size under the rules wasnt immediately available, would have to provide data going back only three years., I am particularly interested in views about how investors in smaller reporting companies will use this information, and the costs to these companies of providing this information, she said., james.peltz@latimes.com, , 5:44 p.m.: Updates with additional details, Originally posted at 11:11 a.m.]", "Date": "20150429", "Title": "[SEC is seeking more clarity on executive pay]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-sec-executive-pay-20150429-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}

Bush, who had flirted with entering the race for the GOP presidential nomination, announced he would not do so., I believe I can make the strongest contribution to our future by continuing as a clear and consistent advocate for a strong Reagan foreign policy that values peace through strength, he said., Even so, the Republican candidate tally seems likely to pass a dozen and could easily reach 20, leaving party officials and TV network executives to grapple with a question certain to bruise big egos: Who will be invited to Cleveland in early August for the first GOP primary debate?, For lower-tier candidates -- with little name identificationor fund-raising prowess -- an opportunityto tussle on a national stage with top-tier contenders like Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida could offer a jump-startto a campaign. For those in the top tier, frequent debates in which theyre forced to share the stage with lesser-known figures provide many opportunities for trouble and little benefit., The Republican National Committee plans to sanction between nine and 12 debates this cycle, which will be hosted by various television networks. After the August debate, the next is planned for the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library near Simi Valley in September., Party officials and the TV hosts want some objective factors they can use to decide which candidates to invite. The list could include polling, fund-raising and the size of on-the-ground staffing in early voting states, among other factors., But right now, those metrics seem likely leave out some candidates whom many Republican strategists would like to showcase to a television audience, including Carly Fiorina, the lone woman in the GOP primary field. Ben Carson, who is the only African American, might also not make the cut., \"Its going to be a mess, no doubt,\" said Terry Casey, an Ohio Republican strategist, a former adviser to Gov. John Kasich, another possible 2016 contender., Having 15 to 20 candidateson stagefor a 90 minute debate is not productive, said Casey, who is not advising Kasich., \"You want a mix of good TV and actualdebate,\" Casey said. \"You dontget that with that many candidates,\" he added. \"Can a camera even captureall of them on stage?\", On the other hand, a big field of interesting candidates is in many ways a problem you want to have as a party, said Stuart Stevens, a senior advisor in 2012 to Mitt Romney. \"With a field so broad and of different viewpoints, it makes us a party of more ideas, Stevens said., A request for comment from the Republican National Committee and Fox News -- which will host the Aug. 6 debate in Cleveland -- was not immediately returned. Party leaders are expected to discuss debate criteria at their spring meeting in Arizona over the weekend., Unlike 2012, the GOP rules this cycle bar participants in the sanctioned debates from appearing in any non-sanctioned forums. During the last presidential cycle the party sanctioned nearly 20 debates. Party officials felt the frequent debates dragged along and battered Romney, the partys eventual nominee., An average of polling compiled by Real Clear Politicsshows no clear front-runnerat the moment.

{"Content": "[[, Ever since 1981, when Ronald Reagan sat outside his California ranch and signed a tax-reform law that reversed half a century of mostly climbing rates, the pursuit of ever-lower income tax brackets has been the prime goal of Republican economic policy., Altering that party orthodoxy has become a main exhibit for Sen. Marco Rubios claim to be a new generation Republican., The 43-year-old Republican senator from Florida has proposed a tax plan that puts less emphasis on lowering the top tax rate and instead offers a large new credit for families with children, which he says will help working households., The plan, the first substantial tax proposal of the 2016 presidential campaign, already has generated debate within Republican policy circles., For more than a generation, the partys economic policy has been dominated by the Laffer curve, economist Arthur Laffers graphic illustration of his argument that reducing tax rates could generate enough economic growth for tax cuts to pay for themselves., Rubios plan tests whether Republican primary voters are willing to go beyond that supply-side view., At a time when Americans continue to struggle with declining wages and a sluggish economy, many Republican leaders believe they need to counter the GOPs image as the party of the rich., Mitt Romney, the partys nominee in 2012, lost to President Obama in part because he embodied that image and appeared dismissive of poorer voters, according to GOP postmortems on the election. Republicans have also done particularly badly with female voters, among whom a tax cut for children could be popular, some strategists argue., But the partys tax purists have not been entirely pleased with any move to de-emphasize cutting the top tax rate. Some have hurled what might be the ultimate insult for a Republican, comparing Rubios $2,500 child tax credit, which more than doubles the current $1,000 allowance for each child under age 17, to one proposed by Obama. Others simply call the tax plan underwhelming., Republican critics say that the top rate in Rubios plan, 35% compared with the current 39.6%, is too high. In 2012, Romney proposed lowering the top rate to 28%. Some upper-income taxpayers without children could see a tax increase under the Rubio plan, critics note., Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush took a swipe at Rubios plan in recent remarks to a forumin Washington sponsored by the National Review, the conservative magazine. His brother, former President George W. Bush, boosted the child tax credit to its current level during his administration. But rather than increase the child credit further, Jeb Bush said he would prefer to try to lower the rates down as [far as] possible., Rep. Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the partys 2012 vice presidential candidate, who has a signed copy of the Laffer curvehanging on his office wall, says he has his own plan, which would push top rates down to 25%. He plans to pursue that as chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, he said., I dont want to be critical, Ryan said at a recent breakfast in Washington when he was asked about Rubios approach. We should have a good, robust debate., On the other side, Democrats say Rubios plan would reduce government revenue by far too much. By trying to expand the child credit while still reducing top rates and including other tax cuts that would directly benefit wealthy taxpayers, Rubio ended up with a plan that carries a price tag of $4 trillion over a decade, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan group based in Washington., Rubio says his plan is crucial to reviving economic growth., You have millions of hardworking, tax-paying Americans who are living paycheck to paycheck, he said in introducing his proposal with fellow Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. The cost of everything keeps going up, but their paychecks do not., Child-rearing contributes to society in the form of future taxpayers who will fuel economic growth, not to mention our future Americans, our future leaders, Rubio, a father of four, said at the National Review forum., As Republican candidates unveil their tax plans, activists in the partys right flank have focused on Sen. Ted Cruzs pursuit of a flat tax and his promise to abolish the Internal Revenue Service., Cruz said at an event last week that he wanted a tax code simple enough that every American can fill out their taxes on a postcard., But even some leading anti-tax activists acknowledge the political appeal of Rubios approach., When Rubio started signaling he was going down that direction, I know I was concerned, said Americans for Tax Reforms president, Grover Norquist, whom many Republicans look to as an arbiter of acceptable tax policy., Considering both the fiscal calculus and the electoral one, Norquist came around. Who would have thought you could come up with something thats pretty easy to explain, but it so useful and cheerful and good? Norquist said. Its very attractive politically  and bulletproof against liberal criticism that its just for rich people., The wealthy, however, would still do well under Rubios proposal. He would eliminate taxes on capital gains, dividends or investments  types of income more often received by the rich than those in the middle or lower end of the income spectrum., He would also cut the corporate tax rate to 25% and apply that same rate to small businesses. Doing so would eliminate a long-standing complaint that smaller entities are taxed at higher rates than large corporations. But because many individual business owners use corporate structures, the proposal would revive opportunities for tax shelters, many of which were eliminated as one of the major parts of the Reagan-era tax changes., Under Rubios plan, people could continue to deduct mortgage interest and charitable giving, but other long-standing tax credits could be eliminated as a way to offset some of the costs., One group of taxpayers could see their income taxes rise under Rubios proposal: higher-income workers without kids., Because Rubios plan simplifies the individual code to just two brackets  35% and 15%  couples earning more than $150,000 (or $75,000 for singles) who were previously in a middle bracket would probably be bumped to the higher 35% rate, without the benefit of the child credit., Rubios backers, however, counter that even those taxpayers could benefit from other parts of the plan, such as the elimination of taxes on capital gains, dividend and interest income., The question is, when he actually fills in the details of his proposal, how far down the road is he going to go? said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Thats a question we cant really answer yet., Its interesting, Gleckman added, that Rubio is arguing that you ought to have a government subsidy for raising children.

{"Content": "[[, Every war casts a long shadow, from the heroism of the Greatest Generation to the dark ambiguities of Vietnam. It was inevitable, then, that the 2016 presidential candidates would be confronted with the war in Iraq., Twelve years on, the broad questions raised by the invasion  about trust in Washington and its leaders, about faith in dubious overseas alliances, about the best ways to fight terrorism and how to bring peace to the Middle East, if thats even possible  have not gone away., If anything, the politics have grown more fraught for members of both parties., Kentucky Republican Rand Paul seized the Senate floor Wednesday for a 101/2 -hour speech aimed at ending the domestic surveillance program that grew out of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001  part of President George W. Bushs justification for war., The accusations of government overreach have been a centerpiece of Pauls presidential bid and made him a champion to privacy advocates and the libertarian-minded. But it also sets him against Republicans eager to portray the freshman lawmaker as feckless and too quick to drop the nations guard., In a mocking speech, New Jerseys Republican Gov. Chris Christie laced into those he called civil liberties extremists, who he said were trying to convince Americans theres a government spook listening in every time you pick up the phone or Skype with your grandkids., They want you to think that if we weakened our capabilities, the rest of the world would love us more, Christie told a New Hampshire audience on Monday. Let me be clear: All these fears are exaggerated and ridiculous., The challenge for candidates like Christie and others in the GOP field is to sound tough  certainly tougher than President Obama is perceived  without appearing belligerent or too eager, as some now fault Bush, to go to war., Familial ties make that balance all the more acute for his brother, Jeb Bush, should he emerge as the Republican nominee, which is why his ham-handed performance last week  seemingly for the Iraq war before he was against it  was so unexpected and potentially damaging., The former Florida governor spent days calibrating and recalibrating a series of statements before flatly declaring that, in retrospect, the invasion should never have occurred. Knowing what we know now, I would not have engaged, Bush said. I would not have invaded Iraq., The question could not, or at least should not, have caught him by surprise, raising doubts about Bushs campaign faculties after a years-long layoff; several GOP rivals were quick to align themselves with popular sentiment, saying they would never have gone to war given the knowledge they possess today., I dont know how that was a hard question, said former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, turning the knife., Bush, however, was not alone among Republicans. On Sunday, in a convoluted Fox News interview, it was Florida Sen. Marco Rubios turn to weave and stumble about the issue, defending President Bushs decision to invade Iraq, given his thinking at the time, while suggesting it was a mistake he would not wish to repeat., For the Democratic candidates, familiar divisions surrounding the war have also begun to emerge., Some on the left have never forgiven the partys favorite, Hillary Rodham Clinton, for backing the war as a United States senator in 2002, and they are once more calling her judgment into question. The former New York lawmaker and secretary of State has expressed regret for her vote many times since, including again this week., Clintons sole announced challenger, independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, said in an interview during a March swing through Iowa, a state with a broad pacifist streak: I think the war in the Mideast, how we got into it and how were going to address the current problems, are issues that every American should be concerned about. He opposed the Iraq war, he tells audiences, from the start., Since 2003, when the Iraq war began, every presidential campaign has been shaped to some degree by the U.S. invasion, its faulty pretense  weapons of mass destruction that were never found  and the wars vexing aftermath., President Bush might not have been reelected in a close 2004 race but for voters reluctance to replace him in the throes of the conflict., His successor, President Obama, would probably not be in office today had his antiwar position not given him the traction in 2008 to take on Clinton, who was then  as now  the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic nomination., But politically it is no longer as simple as being for or against the Iraq invasion., After the withdrawal of U.S. troops under Obama, after the drawing of red lines in Syria and the violent birth of the terrorist group Islamic State, critics can no longer blame Bush for all that torments the region., In 2008 and 2012 there was only one narrative, and that benefited Democrats, said Peter Feaver, a Duke University expert on war and public opinion., In 2016 there is another narrative, which says President Obama inherited an Iraq that was stable and headed on a trajectory to success and then, through choices of his own, destabilized the situation and so bears responsibility for what happened, said Feaver, who served on the National Security Council in Bushs second term., Ultimately, though, the debate comes back to Bush and his decision to send U.S. troops to topple dictator Saddam Hussein, a move he said would leave the world a better, safer place., Its a generational pivot point, said Matthew Dowd, a onetime member of Bushs inner political circle, who was chief strategist for the presidents 2004 reelection campaign before souring on the war in Iraq., At a cost of $2 trillion and more than 4,000 American lives, the wars legacy affects everything, Dowd said. What do we do in Syria? What are we willing to do in Iran? How do we pay to fix our railroads and pay for our kids college loans?, All of this stuff ripples, he said, and will be debated by presidential candidates for many years to come., mark.barabak@latimes.com, Twitter: @markzbarabak, 6:30 p.m. Friday, May 22: Updated with changes throughout., This story was originally published at 3 a.m. Tuesday, May 19.]", "Date": "20150522", "Title": "[Echoes of Iraq war sound in 2016 presidential race]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-iraq-war-politics-analysis-20150519-story.html", "Author": "[Mark Z.

{"Content": "[[, Evoking his youth and familys immigrant experience, Sen. Marco Rubio announced Monday that he is running for president, the third Republican to join a race he hopes to dominate by wrapping his conservative politics in an only-in-America story., Speaking at Freedom Tower in downtown Miami, known as the Ellis Island of the South for welcoming Cuban exiles, the young Florida senator displayed the skills that make him one of the partys more gifted communicators., \"Now, the time has come for our generation to lead the way toward a new American Century,\" he told the crowd., At risk of being overshadowed by the launch of Hillary Rodham Clintons campaign, Rubio, 43, emphasized the contrast he makes with the Democratic frontrunner and portrayed himself as a fresh voice from a new generation of tea party Republicans., While our people and economy are pushing the boundaries of the 21st century, too many of our leaders and their ideas are stuck in the 20th century, he said, adding that America wont succeed by going back to the leaders and ideas of the past. We must change the decisions we are making by changing the people who are making them., Rubios event was modest by contemporary campaign standards, an intimate introduction at the historic venue before a crowd of nearly 1,000, many of whom paid $3.05 for tickets -- a nod to youth culture that labels a city by its telephone code. It was broadcast on a large screen outside., Rubio leaned heavily on his upbringing as the American-born son of Cuban immigrants -- his father a bartender, his mother a maid -- who only later in life appreciated the success he could achieve in the United States., Surrounded by his wife and four young children, Rubio said he rebuffed advice from some to wait and run again when he is older and has more experience., \"But I cannot,\" he said. \"Because I believe our very identity as an exceptional nation is at stake, and I can make a difference as president.\", Central to Rubios struggle, particularly in Miami, is former Gov.

{"Content": "[[, Facing a tough midterm election, Democrats put aside some of their remaining scruples about the new age of unlimited campaign spending and courted unions and hedge-fund billionaires for big checks to try to salvage a Senate majority., They spent a lot of money. But not enough., This year, in a reversal of 2012, the big-money Democratic donors watched their investments return little on election night Tuesday. Although Republicans outspent them overall, Democrats got beaten even in states like Colorado and North Carolina where they spent the same or even a little more than Republicans., ------------FOR THE RECORD: Midterm election: In the Nov. 9 Section A, an article about spending during the midterm election said that Democratic candidates and outside groups supporting them spent a total of about $1.64 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. They spent about $1.64 billion.   ------------, \"We just saw a national tsunami,\" said Ty Matsdorf, an advisor to the Senate Majority PAC, which spent about $50 million across the country in a mostly futile effort to keep Democrats in office., \"I dont think theres anything more we should have done,\" Matsdorf said. \"Heres the truth: Everybody knew this was going to be a hard cycle. Everyone knew we were going to face extremely strong head winds.\", Republican donors credited their success to a number of adjustments they had made since the last election cycle: more say in choosing electable candidates, investment in get-out-the-vote efforts that had been a Democratic advantage, and a late spending push., The spending in the 2014 midterm showed how the remaining restrictions on campaign spending continue to weaken. More money moved into \"super PACs\" and dark-money nonprofits, where donations are unlimited, and away from candidate accounts that are still subject to strict limits on individual giving and disclosure., Overall, including spending by candidates and outside groups, Republicans spent about $1.75 billion to Democrats $1.64 billion, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks election spending., -----------, For the Record, Nov. 9, 10:35 a.m.: This story originally said that Democrats spent $1.64 million on the midterm elections; they spent $1.64 billion., This story was first published Nov. 8 at 6:31 p.m., -----------, , But those numbers come with a big asterisk: They dont include much of the spending by so-called dark-money groups., Another tracking organization, the nonprofit Sunlight Foundation, has traced about $145 million spent in dark money, but the real number is unknown. Dark-money spending overwhelmingly favors Republicans., In Alaska, outside groups poured $40 million into the Senate race between Mark Begich, the incumbent Democrat, and Republican Dan Sullivan., The votes are still being counted, but all told, candidates and groups will have spent about $120 per registered voter, more than double the figure in any other state  and more than $250 for every voter who actually made it to the polls., Some players in the Republican money establishment say they also learned a lesson from the defeats of the last two elections: no more gaffe-prone, crash-and-burn candidates., American Crossroads, a super PAC thats part of the political operation built by former Bush advisor Karl Rove, put down money in Republican Senate primaries in Alaska and North Carolina to ensure the party would nominate experienced, mainstream candidates who could inspire confidence in deep-pocketed donors., \"We were not going to tolerate wacky candidates taking down the whole ticket,\" said Andy Abboud, a political advisor to Sheldon Adelson, the casino operator and Republican mega-donor who spent close to $100 million in 2012 and ended up with a string of defeats. \"Those candidates were largely discouraged.\", He said Adelson was wary of getting burned again by a candidate like Todd Akin, the former Missouri congressman and Senate candidate who became a national rallying point for Democrats in 2012 when he argued that women rarely became pregnant from a \"legitimate rape.\", \"All the money in the world cannot fix bad candidates,\" Abboud said., This time around, Adelson was also more skeptical of the pitches made by political consultants, Abboud said., \"We live in Vegas,\" Abboud said. \"Were used to people coming here and trying to take our money.\", Adelson wanted to see less money spent on television ads (where consultants get a commission on spending) and more on the tougher work of building effective get-out-the-vote operations, Abboud said, and he pressed operatives on what they were doing differently this year., Adelson gave $5 million in reported spending to the Congressional Leadership Fund, and at least $20 million to two other groups that dont disclose their donors, including another Rove group, Crossroads GPS, as first reported by Politico., Abboud wouldnt say how much Adelson spent overall, except that it was \"less than $100 million.\", Republican groups invested heavily in field operations, particularly Americans for Prosperity, the organization supported by the billionaire conservative Koch brothers, which hired about 600 people to knock on doors in competitive states including Colorado, Florida and North Carolina., Other Democrats said their get-out-the-vote efforts were overrun by a tide that swung toward Republicans in the final week., Late spending by groups on the right helped to close the deals. Crossroads, which spent about $50 million overall this election, spent nearly half that  more than $21 million  in key Senate races in October., A lot of the money went to an ad in which a young girl at a spelling bee is asked to spell the name of the Democratic candidate, and responds, \"O-B-A-M-A.\" \"Close enough,\" the judges say., Crossroads cut the ad in the spring but saved it for the end, thinking humor would help cut through the late clutter of ads, said Steven Law, president of American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS., \"It delivered our best closing argument,\" linking Democrats to the unpopular president, Law said., Democrats could not counter every Republican money move and had to triage between competitive states., In Florida, backers of the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, former Gov. Charlie Crist, scrambled to come up with extra donations after incumbent Republican Gov. Rick Scott put $13 million of his own money into more advertising., \"On the Friday before the election, the campaign fundraisers turned over every rock, mortgaged their children and begged another $500,000 from donors to better compete in Miami,\" Jim Margolis, partner at GMMB, an advertising consulting firm that worked for Crist, said in an email., \"Thirty minutes after we bought the time, Scott simply sent over another $500,000 to cover our move. It was like play money to them.\", Now, both sides are already thinking about 2016, a presidential year in which Democrats will be waging Senate campaigns in much friendlier states. The super PAC and outside money wars will almost inevitably escalate., Although Democrats say they still favor campaign finance reform, there is little chance of that passing the new Senate, expected to be led by Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, who for years has crusaded for unlimited donations without disclosure., \"Nobody likes the system. We wish campaign finance reform would pass so we could go away,\" Matsdorf said. \"I think our supporters, Democratic donors, decided you just have to play by the rules as theyre written, not what you want them to be.\", joseph.tanfani@latimes.com, Twitter: @JTanfani]", "Date": "20141108", "Title": "[Democrats lost the big-money game in midterm election]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-midterm-money-20141109-story.html", "Author": "[Joseph Tanfani]"}
{"Content": "[[, Fears that the West Africa Ebola outbreak could spread more widely in America have roiled a midterm election campaign thats already taken numerous unexpected detours, putting candidates in a reactive mode at a time when they had hoped to deliver their closing pitches., What was once called a campaign about nothing has actually been anything but, with clashes in Ukraine, the rise of Islamic State militants and a flood of unaccompanied minors at the southwestern U.S. border testing campaigns ability to adapt their playbook on the fly. The transmission of the Ebola virus within the United States has piqued voter interest in a way that other issues have not, both parties say., Republicans, who have long cast doubts on the Obama administrations competence, began questioning federal preparedness for the possible spread of Ebola at an early stage. After the first reported case of Ebola in the United States by a Liberian visitor, a Senate candidate in North Carolina,Thom Tillis, became one of the first Republicans to suggest banning travel to the United States from West African nations dealing with the outbreak. Others quickly followed, often accompanied by calls for Democratic opponents to join them., At a House hearing Thursday, one lawmaker said Congress might take up the issue of a travel ban in a post-election session if the Obama administration does not institute one on its own., \"People are asking that we do that, and they are exactly correct to make that request,\" said Rep. Michael C. Burgess (R-Texas), an obstetrician who represents a district that includes Dallas northwest suburbs., Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), the Houses third-ranking Republican, told reporters after Thursdays hearing that a vote shouldnt be necessary. , Obama \"loves bragging about the things he can do with a pen and a phone -- many of which are things that he cant do,\" said Scalise, the majority whip. \"He can approve a travel ban today, and weve called on him to do that.\", The intensity of interest in the Ebola issue drew two House members running in hotly contested Senate races, Democrat Bruce Braley of Iowa and Republican Cory Gardner of Colorado, off the campaign trail to attend Thursdays hearing of a Senate Energy and Commerce subcommittee. Both men expressed concerns about whether the administration had responded quickly enough., Hours later, Braley sought to turn the issue against Republicans during a televised debate, saying the partys zeal to cut federal spending resulted in cuts to the Centers for Disease Controls budget. \"The policies you are promoting would have made it more difficult to address this problem,\" he said to his opponent, Joni Ernst. She accused Braley and the administration of being \"reactive instead of proactive\" on the issue. \"We have seen the threat from Ebola for the past several months,\" she said., That such an external development late in a campaign could knock candidates off stride is hardly unprecedented. Some Republicans still believe Mitt Romney was on a path to victory in the 2012 presidential election until Obama traveled to New Jersey to inspect recovery efforts from Superstorm Sandy with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Now Democrats are leaning on the president to demonstrate his administration has a firmer grip on the Ebola scare., Fridays appointment of Ron Klain as the administrations Ebola czar -- something even Democrats had begun to publicly call for -- was warmly greeted by party leaders, though some Republicans questioned the choice of a longtime Democratic political operative with no medical experience. The White House accused the GOP of playing politics., \"Three weeks before Election Day, Republicans are seeking to score political points?\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said sarcastically when asked about GOP skepticism about Klain. , Democrats have known for more than a year that they would be running in a difficult political environment and planned accordingly, stockpiling millions of dollars to protect the Senate majority and crafting an agenda intended to play to Democratic strengths, like boosting the minimum wage and protecting access to contraceptive care., Republicans now say Democrats attempts to stay on message as these other crises developed left them looking out of touch with the electorate., An ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted this month found that the economy was still the leading issue voters said would determine their vote for Congress. But the same survey found that nearly two-thirds of Americans were concerned about the possibility of an Ebola epidemic in the United States, and the dominance of the story on cable news threatened to crowd the debate with voting already underway in many states., \"What the American people pay attention to is usually radically different than what we pay attention to,\" said Rob Collins, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \"The continual crises that this administration has found themselves in has been something that has been a constant theme and something that the American people are paying attention to.\", After Thursdays hearing, Scalise insisted Republicans were not politicizing the Ebola scare, praising members of both parties for their \"serious, sincere, direct questions\" at the hearing., \"This is not a political issue,\" he insisted. \"I think there were a lot of unanswered questions from members on both sides of the aisle today. And so were going to continue to ask these questions.\", Follow @mikememoli on Twitter for more news out of Washington.]", "Date": "20141017", "Title": "[Ebola scare is the latest issue to cloud midterm election debate]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-ebola-politics-20141017-story.html", "Author": "[Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, Few if any of the domestic policy proposals President Obama talked about in his sixth State of the Union speech stand much chance of landing on his desk to be signed into law, but theyve already begun to have an impact in another arena: shaping the race to succeed him., From executive actions he can take on his own to policy initiatives that draw sharp contrasts with the Republican majority in Congress, Obama has set a large chunk of the issue agenda for the 2016 presidential campaign, long before either party has picked a nominee., Whether its Hillary Rodham Clinton or someone else, the Democratic nominee, for example, almost certainly will feel a need to endorse Obamas move to shield millions of immigrants in the country illegally from deportation  a step that has proved extremely popular with Latinos, a core part of the Democratic coalition., And as the House demonstrated this month by voting to order deportations of young people whom Obama already has shielded, Republicans almost certainly will demand that their nominee oppose Obamas policy, even at the cost of alienating Latino voters., Obamas effort to combat global warming by reducing the amount of coal the U.S. burns has created a similar divide. That gap probably will widen this year as Republicans try to undo the presidents environmental policies., Those actions changed the status quo, forcing political figures on both sides of the partisan divide to take firm positions on issues they might have preferred to elide. Tuesday nights speech and its two-week lead-up period demonstrated another way a president can shape the political agenda: by focusing attention on proposals of his choosing., \"Republicans arent going to be excited about putting Obamas agenda into law,\" said Brendan Nyhan, an assistant professor of government at Dartmouth College. History offers very few examples of a president actually changing the publics views on major issues. But, Nyhan said, by talking about an issue, a president can raise its profile., \"People may not agree with what he proposes,\" Nyhan said. \"But they may think the issue is more important\" because of the presidential spotlight., The idea of making community college free for most American students, for example, has received a boost from the attention Obama has given it., Similarly, his call for a middle-class tax cut paid for largely by raising taxes on inherited wealth sets a marker that both parties nominees will need to take into account as they vie over that key voter group., Obamas effort to influence the campaign ahead, however, went beyond specific issues. The tenor of the speech, his sunny optimism about the nations condition and its future, and his effort to associate his party with \"rising incomes and chances for everyone\" set the stage for the theme every incumbent party hopes to be able to wield: Dont mess with success., The stakes are high for Obama, who, according to his aides, is acutely aware that the next president can cement in place or try to dislodge some of his key policy accomplishments, including his healthcare law, new regulations aimed at combating climate change and the policy on deportations., On each of those issues, Democrats, and some outside analysts, believe that Obamas positions put his party on the winning side of the debate, energizing parts of its electoral coalition, including Latinos on immigration and younger voters on global warming, and forcing Republicans to defend positions held by a minority of voters., \"He wants to put Republicans in a box, put them in the position where they have to choose between taking an unpopular position in the general election or one that hurts in a primary,\" said John G. Geer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University., Republican strategists scoff at that, pointing to their success in Novembers midterm election. If anything, they argue, Obama is boxing in Clinton, taking positions that could force her to run further to the left than Democratic strategists might wish., So far, there is little evidence of a big gap between the Obama and Clinton positions on major topics. One of the main tax breaks that Obama would curtail, for example, the so-called stepped-up basis for inherited capital gains  which White House aides have newly dubbed the \"trust fund loophole\"  is also targeted in a major economic policy plan released last week by a group with close ties to Clinton., The two have numerous channels that they can use to avoid policy conflicts. White House senior advisor John Podesta, for example, is expected to leave Obamas staff soon to take up a position running Clintons campaign., Officially, the White House insists none of what he is doing is about the next election. \"The president said hes run his last campaign,\" White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough said on National Public Radio on Tuesday morning, a line Obama reiterated to Congress. \"This has nothing to do with the campaign.\", Such protestations aside, Obama does have \"another election in front of him,\" said Michael Waldman, a former speechwriter to President Clinton and now president of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. \"If he doesnt think his legacy is going to be shaped by who wins the presidency, Id be surprised.\", Indeed, Geer said, Obamas \"legacy will depend in part on getting a successor elected.\", In the eight decades since the Great Depression and the New Deal reshaped American politics, only two presidents, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, successfully built and nurtured political coalitions that were able to survive three elections., For Obama, Geer said, adding a third name to that list, particularly after the Democrats stinging defeat this fall, \"would be a vindication of his second term.\", david.lauter@latimes.com, Twitter: @davidlauter, Times staff writer Kathleen Hennessey contributed to this report.]", "Date": "20150121", "Title": "[With State of the Union, Obama sets agenda ... for 2016 election]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-obama-analysis-20150121-story.html", "Author": "[David Lauter]"}
{"Content": "[[, Few states have experienced the political volatility that Colorado has over the last two decades., Control of the Legislature flipped back and forth. The state see-sawed in presidential contests., The last two years, though, have been particularly eventful., In 2013, after Democrats seized control of the statehouse under Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper, lawmakers went on a spree, passing a liberal wish list that thrilled left-leaning constituents but alienated plenty of others, especially rural conservatives upset by a brace of gun-control measures adopted after the July 2012 Aurora theater massacre., The result, just a few months later, was a nationally publicized recall that ended in the ouster of two Democratic lawmakers, one of them president of the state Senate., On Tuesday, however, in a little-noticed footnote to Colorados closely watched gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races, the Democrats won back both of those seats, and it wasnt at all close in either Pueblo or Colorado Springs., At the time, the recall was trumpeted far and wide as a victory for pro-gun activists; a third state senator in the Denver suburbs quit soon after rather than face the prospect of being tossed from office before this years elections., Now its gun-control activists who are crowing. , Mark Glaze, former executive director of the group Everytown for Gun Safety, said the results showed that when a significant portion of the electorate turns out, rather than a small, agitated minority, support for something like universal background checks for gun buyers is a politically winning position. (That was part of the package Hickenlooper, who was reelected Tuesday, signed into law.), The message remains that the [National Rifle Association] can bully politicians or buy them for a few pieces of silver but they have no influence over the general public, Glaze said., Interesting statement from a man who doles out money the way he does, replied Laura Carno, a conservative strategist in Colorado Springs who helped lead the recall effort against then-State Senate President John Morse. The reference was to former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, whose generous contributions and organization, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, became an issue in the recall., Once in Denver, the state capital, the Republicans who replaced the two booted Democrats joined efforts to overturn the states background check requirement, as well as a new law limiting the size of gun magazines to 15 rounds or fewer.,  Both attempts failed but not before the Republican who replaced Morse, Bernie Herpin, rather indelicately suggested it was maybe a good thing that accused killer James Holmes showed up at the Aurora theater with a 100-round magazine because it jammed., \"If he had four, five, six 15-round magazines, theres no telling how much damage he could have done until a good guy with a gun showed up,\" Herpin said., The remark caused great upset, not least for relatives of the Aurora victims, but didnt necessarily damage Herpins reelection chances. Strategists on both sides say gun issues played little role in this falls campaign, in either Pueblo or Colorado Springs., Allies of Morse did, however, take particular pleasure in Herpins defeat by Democrat Michael Merrifield, who once worked for Bloombergs anti-gun group., As for the former lawmaker, his feeling is less a sense of vindication than an attitude of I-told-you so., He noted that both Senate districts are heavily Democratic and even the relatively meager turnout for Tuesdays midterm election far exceeded the 20% of voters who cast ballots in the September 2013 recall vote., Its like, yeah, of course, Morse said in a telephone interview from Denver, where he opened a certified public accounting practice. We were always going to take back that seat and we did., Morse had been scheduled to leave office under term limits in January 2015. , I had an eight-year contract, in two four-year increments. The voters let me out after seven years, he said. He professed no regrets.,  Im glad I did what I did, Morse said of his support for the gun legislation., As for Herpin, he called during a break in a Republican caucus luncheon, where lawmakers were awaiting a count of votes in suburban Adams County to learn which party will control the Senate starting next year., He expressed no regrets either. It was an honor to serve, Herpin said of his relatively brief Senate term, adding it was too soon to say whether he will run again in 2016., Dont wait for the next special election to follow  @markzbarabak for more on national & Western politics, 9:39 a.m.: This post has been updated to reflect that Mark Glaze is the former executive director of Everytown for Gun Safety., This story was originally published at 6 a.m., ]", "Date": "20141109", "Title": "[In a turnabout, Colorado Democrats win back seats lost in gun recall]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-colorado-gun-recall-midterm-election-20141107-story.html", "Author": "[Mark Z.

{"Content": "[[, Fewer than 50 days before an election that may give Republicans control of the Senate as well as the House, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Saturday skipped past those contests entirely to focus on one in which he may play a more central role  the 2016 presidential race., Paul, the featured speaker at the California Republican convention, made no mention of the partys national advantages this year. He blasted President Obama and potential Democratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton as insufficient present or future commanders-in-chief. He insisted that the GOP must dramatically expand its reach in order to win presidential contests  a strategy that coincides with his pre-presidential efforts., He accused Obama of confounding the Constitution when he expanded Obamacare, moved against overseas targets without specific congressional authorization, and announced plans  since delayed  to use executive action to change the nations immigration laws., It is a terrible tragedy, it is a danger to us as a country, and we need to do everything we can to stop him from abusing our laws, Paul said. He said later, \"We have a president who basically has created a lawless atmosphere in Washington., Speaking about Clinton, he used her famous 2008 primary ad, which argued that she more than Obama would be the president capable of answering a phone call about a middle-of-the-night crisis:, I think she had a 3 a.m. moment. She didnt answer the phone, and I think it absolutely should preclude her from being [president], he said after detailing what he termed her failings leading up to the 2012 attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya. (His final word was obscured by applause from the strongly anti-Clinton crowd.), Those were the easy targets, however. Pauls more passionate appeal was one that he has forwarded across the country in such unlikely venues as UC Berkeley. Pauls argument  that the party needs to expand from its older and white base, groups amply represented among the delegates  was framed as one that could reverse the partys long record of thumpings in California and its national presidential losses., When our party looks like America  with earrings and without earrings, with ponytails and without ponytails, with tattoos and without tattoos  when we look like the rest of America  white, black, brown  were going to win again, he told an audience gathered near LAX. Weve got to go out and weve got to broaden our party, and when we do, well be a national party again. We will win again., Paul suggested a freshening of the GOP message  he did not, he said, mean to suggest that the party dilute its principles and be more like Democrats  in order to attract young voters and the Latino and African American voters who have spurned the party in California and elsewhere., He specifically cited issues he has pressed for months, including the NSAs mining of data from cell phones, what he termed excessive sentences for drug use and expanding the ability of voters to cast ballots., What you say or do on your cell phone is none of the governments damn business, he said., But as he made his argument there was a bit of a reality check in the room  Neel Kashkari, the partys nominee for governor., The child of immigrants from India, Kashkari has conducted an unusual campaign: He spent time posing as a homeless person to underscore his criticism of Democratic policies on poverty, and he marched in a gay rights parade in San Diego., And he remains the longest of long shots in November, trailing Democratic incumbent Jerry Brown by 21 points among likely voters in a recent USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll., The same poll found that state Republicans were the antithesis of Pauls vision of a diverse party: 74% were white and only 25% either Latino, African American or Asian. (Among Democrats, half were non-white, far more similar to the state overall.) Almost 6 in 10 state Republicans were 50 or older, meaning that the party serves to suffer as its members are replaced by younger voters who are far more likely to be Democratic or nonpartisan., In an interview after his speech, Paul lauded Kashkaris candidacy and described him as someone who could be the face of a new GOP. But when reminded of Kashkaris distant second-place standing, he acknowledged that change could be slow in coming, even if the Republican party follows his advice., We became the minority party in California over, what, 20 years? he asked. It didnt happen overnight. To reverse it takes a while, but I think hes saying and doing all the right things., Without trying, he added, well never win. , For political news and analysis, follow me on Twitter: @cathleendecker , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ]", "Date": "20140920", "Title": "[Rand Paul blisters Obama and Clinton, calls for GOP diversity ]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-rand-paul-blisters-obama-and-clinton-calls-for-gop-diversity-20140920-story.html", "Author": "[Cathleen Decker]"}
{"Content": "[[, Finally, conservatives have a real socialist to go crazy about. Instead of concoctingdark fairytales about how Barack Obama, a very conventional liberal Democrat, is a secret Marxist who wants to destroy the American way of life, they can shriek about Bernie Sanders, the independent Vermont senator who has never shied away from the socialist label., Sanders is now the first person to challenge Hillary Rodham Clinton in the race to win the 2016 Democratic Party presidential nomination. Clinton, though, is not his real adversary, Sanders says. He refuses to make disparaging comments about Clinton and insists he has never run an attack ad in any campaign and will not do so against her. Sanders wants to take on the billionaires, not Hillary., Nobody gives the 73-year-old Sanders a chance of stopping the Clinton political juggernaut, but some think he could make it veer to the left. If the Vermonter gets traction in debates and primaries with his unabashedly progressive positions, Clinton might be forced to match at least some of his rhetoric. Would that be a bad thing for Democrats? Not if enough beleaguered middle class voters get a chance to consider what Sanders version of socialism entails and like what they see., Lets consider some of Sanders wild ideas:, Free college tuition. This is something that students can count on in many European countries and that once was not uncommon in the United States. In what many consider the most golden era of the Golden State, Californias great public university system was tuition-free. In many other states, students paid only a few hundred dollars per year to go to top state colleges. Now, of course, American students are graduating with crushing student loan debts while many others cannot afford to pay in the first place. Sanders idea seems radical only in that it makes radically good sense., A $1-trillion program to rebuild the nations roads and bridges. This would not only create thousands of jobs, it would finally address the countrys glaring infrastructure crisis that threatens freight mobility and interstate commerce. This sounds pretty pro-business  in a good way., Break up giant financial institutions. If they are too big to fail, they are too big to exist, Sanders says. Unless you enjoyed the economic crash of 2008, this probably sounds like a pretty reasonable idea., Publicly funded elections. Instead of seeing the spectacle of candidates for president and Congress taking turns begging for money at gatherings of billionaires and corporate lobbyists, public funding for campaigns might encourage politicians to pay attention to those of us who dont have the ability to buy influence in our government. This feels vaguely un-American only because it has been so long since money did not rule American politics., Higher taxes on the wealthy. Well, obviously, the schemes Sanders wants to enact would not be free. The money has to come from somewhere. The United States is a very rich country and should be able to do things like rebuild bridges, fix highways and insure thatthe next generation gets an education without being loaded with debt. The problem is that the vast majority of that wealth is held by a tiny few and a huge share of the new dollars coming into the economy is derived from the financial sector. Those financiers are really bad at creating middle-class jobs, but they are experts at avoiding taxes. Getting more of the wealth spun from elaborate financial trickery to spend on the common good rather than on more mansions in the Hamptons may be a radical idea, but its not necessarily a bad idea., Government-run healthcare. Yup, this one really is socialism. Its what they have in hellish commie wastelands like Germany, Denmark, Japan, Canada and the rest of the industrialized world. Its also what Americans over the age of 64 have. We call it Medicare., Sanders is never going to be president. Most voters are not ready to approve his full program. Still, he will have done this country a great service if, through his blunttalk and grandfatherly presence, he gets more citizens to stop being distracted by scare stories and political labels and to start considering ideas on their merits. A 40-hour work week, a minimum wage and restrictions on child labor were once thought of as subversive, socialist doctrines, but they have turned out to be pretty good ideas for Americans  except maybe for the billionaires.]", "Date": "20150506", "Title": "[Bernie Sanders' 'socialism' may have mainstream appeal]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/topoftheticket/la-na-tt-bernie-sanders-socialism-20150505-story.html", "Author": "[David Horsey]"}

His campaign, expected to formally launch next month, is largely built around his image as a fighter for conservative causes who has won key battles., In this small city, the University of Wisconsins flagship campus, long seen as a liberal bastion, sits less than a mile from the state Capitol, and the lines between the conservative governor and his liberal opponents are sharply drawn., Professors fume at what they regard as a multi-pronged attack. Walkers allies say he and the Republican-majority Legislature are carrying out a mandate for reform on behalf of beleaguered taxpayers., The Legislature is set to vote within weeks on a budget that includes a $250-million cut to higher education over the next two years, roughly an 11% reduction in state support for the university system. More attention has focused on a provision of the budget that removes tenure protection from state law  leaving it in the hands of a board of regents largely appointed by Walker. The proposal would also broaden the power of administrators to eliminate academic positions and departments in the name of efficiency., The president of the board and the UW-Madison chancellor have pledged to maintain tenure and academic freedom. But faculty are skeptical they will have the same iron-clad protections against retaliation for controversial research, particularly the type of scholarship that can leave winners and losers in the marketplace., Chancellor Rebecca Blank told the faculty Monday that the controversy means the school would have a bulls-eye on our back in competing with other institutions for recruits and defending against poaching by rivals. Blank pledged that she would not accept a tenure policy that falls short of peer universities protections and urged professors to band together in preserving the universitys reputation., I know that there are a lot of angry and a lot of very worried and a lot of very upset people, Blank told faculty members during one of several campus forums. My staff can tell you just how angry Ive been at various times over the last five to six months., My role is not to be angry, she said. My role is to figure out how we move forward., Blank said she has been frustrated by headlines declaring the end of tenure. Wisconsin is unusual in enshrining tenure protections for university professors in state statute; at nearly all public universities, tenure is set by administrative policies., The board of regents has approved language that will keep tenure protections in place even if they are removed from state law. But faculty also worry about another section of the budget bill  inserted by the Legislature  that relaxes the ability to lay off professors because of budget issues or changes to academic programs deemed necessary., That sort of open-ended phrase could be used to undermine academic freedom, some faculty members say., As long as this section exists, what we have is not tenure, said David Vanness, a population health sciences professor., Regina Millner, president of the regents who oversee all 26 of the states colleges and universities, said repeatedly during an interview that she and her colleagues were conscious of the need to protect academic freedom for numerous reasons, including the imperativeto compete for top faculty talent. Walker, she said, was trying to provide more financial flexibility to the systems leaders during tight budget times., Walker came into office as a reform candidate, said Millner, who was appointed to her seven-year term by Walker in 2012. Hes comfortable with reform, and he understands that theres going to be a certain amount of angst with any reform., State Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican, blames faculty members for politicizing the issue by claiming that the tenure changes are more dramatic than they are., ------------, FOR THE RECORD, 8:36 a.m.: An earlier version of this article gave the name of the Wisconsin Assembly speaker as Robin Voss. His name is Robin Vos., ------------, But Walker, too, has dramatized the issue, saying earlier this year that the changes he was proposing for state colleges would be the Act 10 of higher education, a reference to the bill eliminatingcollective bargaining rights for most public employees, which passed early in his term., The drive to pass Act 10 continues to define Walkers governorship to both supporters and detractors., In the months after the law passed, protesters filled the Capitol beyond capacity and unions led an unsuccessful campaign to recall the governor. Today, protestersstill gather almost daily under the rotunda, but their ranks are down to a trickle. On Tuesday, about20 showed up at lunchtime, singing Will the Circle Be Unbroken and unfurling a maroon banner with a fractured outline of the state map atop a broken heart., In March, Walker also signed a right to work bill that curbed the power of private-sector unions., Vos said he initially viewed tenure as an outdated notion but has been persuaded that professors need some protection, citing the example of conservatives who work in campuses dominated by die-hard liberals. But he insisted that tenure should not be simply permanent job protection, particularly for professors who are unproductive or work in outdated fields., Now, if Gov. Walker wants to talk about that on the campaign trail, I guess he can do that, Vos said. But I dont think thats the reason for it., Many professors say they believe that Walker, who dropped out of Marquette University, and would be the first president since Harry Truman without a college degree if he were to win, sees no political upside to placating them., Were seen as this major liberal institution, said Donald Downs, a political scientist who has taught at the school for 30 years. Downs, a national leader in free-speech issues who was active in abolishing faculty speech codes in the 1990s, said the attack on higher education is part of Walkers broader vision to dismantle Wisconsins Blue State model., That strategy, he pointed out, works well with Walkers bid to win the Iowa caucuses by consolidating the support of conservatives just a few months after he signs the budget., Weve been sitting up here as a target for a long time, he said, sitting outside the student union beside Lake Mendota. None of this surprises me at all., Twitter:@noahbierman]", "Date": "20150623", "Title": "[Scott Walker, going for conservative trifecta, takes on tenured professors]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-walker-wisconsin-tenure-20150623-story.html", "Author": "[Noah Bierman ]"}

Patrick Murphy announced on Monday his candidacy for Senate in whats expected to be an open seat in next years general election., The Florida contest will be one of several key Senate races in 2016 as Democrats look to regaincontrol of the upper chamber of Congress after losing it in last years midterm elections., For several weeks Murphy, who has served in the House since being elected in 2012, has hinted he might run in the race and has beena top recruit of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee., His entrance comes as incumbent Republican Sen.

{"Content": "[[, For conservative voters looking for outsider presidential candidates without the bombast of Donald Trump, an alternative has emerged in recent weeks: Dr. Ben Carson, the pioneering neurosurgeon whose faith is central to his story., Carson spent nearly three decades as director of pediatric neurosurgery at Baltimores famed Johns Hopkins Hospital, where he was the first surgeon in the world to separate Siamese twins and would often say a silent prayer before performing each operation. But hes never run for office before. Hes never even worked on a political campaign., Yet it is precisely those qualities -- his Christian faith, his outsider status and his medical background  that intrigue Republicans yearning for something new from a crowded cast of presidential candidates. Several polls in early-voting states and nationally have Carson in second place to Trump when it comes to support from Republicans. In Iowa, which will kick off the early nominating contests in the 2016 race, Carson is polling well with an important GOP voting bloc, evangelical Christian voters. And he has financial backing from leaders of Fortune 500 companies., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, He fits the bill perfectly, he really does, said Steffen Schmidt, a longtime professor of political science at Iowa State University. Hes not in your face calling people stupid. Hes talking about his life and how its driven by his faith  thats resonating with voters., Carson doubled down on that difference Wednesday when asked by reporters ahead of a rally in Anaheim about what separates him from Trump. His faith, Carson answered., I realize where my successes come from and I dont in any way deny my faith in God, he said., It was something of a change for Carson, who has sidestepped going negative and attacking his challengers and, for the most part, is in lockstep with the GOP field when it comes to Republican ideology., In his stump speeches  where Carson can sound like a college lecturer, rather than a rabble-rousing candidate  he notes his support for downsizing the federal government, replacing the Affordable Care Act and securing the southern border as his first act of immigration reform., We have a problem with illegal immigration in this country and weve got all kinds of theories that people want to put forward.  We have a porous border and we need to seal the border, Carson said at the rally at the Anaheim Convention Center., In his remarks before several hundred supporters, Carson said there should be concerns not just about immigrants illegally entering the U.S. through the southern border but also that the porous border is an opportunity for terrorists to sneak in to the U.S., But at times he appears to wobble when it comes to addressing issues. While speaking to a civic group inside a luxury downtown San Francisco hotel Tuesday, Carson was pressed for specifics on how to reduce the federal deficit and eliminate Obamacare. He only offered vague responses about reining in the governments under-utilized office spaces and creating medical savings accounts that could be an alternative to the healthcare law., Carson, the only black candidate in the 2016 race, also once called Obamacare the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery, a comparison that drew criticism from more moderate Republicans and Democrats. And hes alluded to homosexuality as a choice, saying that a lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight  and when they come out, theyre gay. He later apologized., Yet for Republicans, who have struggled to dislodge themselves as a party dominated by older white men, Carsons candidacy also provides new opportunities to widen support to minorities. A postmortem of the 2012 election by national Republicans stressed the need to appeal more to minority voters, chiefly blacks and Latinos, after a cycle in which President Obama far outpaced Mitt Romney in support from minority ethnic groups., Carsons entrance into national politics came a year later at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, where he gained plaudits from conservatives  especially tea partyers  for castigating President Obamas healthcare law while the president sat nearby. The broadside launched him onto the paid speaking circuit, and Carson, who retired from Johns Hopkins in 2013, has delivered more than 140 paid speeches over the last two years, talking about his faith and helping others while amassing nearly $4 million off of the talks, according to his personal financial disclosure form., See the most-read stories this hour >>, It is the combination of his faith and his story that his campaign plans to capitalize on, Barry Bennett, Carsons campaign manager, said in an interview. In television and radio ads in Iowa and New Hampshire this fall, the campaign will tell of Carson growing up poor in Detroit and working toward a better life through education. And last weekend marked the 28th anniversary of when Carson separated German twins joined at the head. His campaign noted the milestone on Facebook in a post that gained more than 90,000 likes., His appeal is hes a doctor, hes caring, hes smart. He has a background not in politics, Bennett said., A recent Monmouth University poll of likely Iowa Republican caucus-goers showed Carson outpacing Trump 29% to 23% when it came to support from evangelicals. In a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll, Christian conservatives favored Carson 23% to 16% over Trump., Can he hold onto that support will be the big question, said Schmidt, noting that earlier in the summer Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, the son of a Baptist preacher with deep Midwestern roots, was the favorite to court the Christian conservative vote in Iowa. Polls now show Walker failing to make significant inroads with evangelicals., By staying clear of the political battles between Trump and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Bennett said his candidate will be well positioned into the fall., From Day One, hes said hes not going to run against anyone, Bennett said. Hes going to run to save the country. Hes not interested in playing those political, cheap games., Among the most ardent supporters of Carson, a Seventh-day Adventist, are some of the wealthiest chief executives of Fortune 500 businesses. Theres Barbara and David Green, the evangelical billionaire owners of Hobby Lobby. And J. Frank Harrison III, CEO of Coca-Cola, who has founded missions overseas., A majority of Carsons financial backing has come from California, where in the last fundraising quarter he raised more than $400,000., Curtis Estes, a Los Angeles resident and certified financial planner at Northwestern Mutual, gave a max contribution to Carsons campaign last quarter and is organizing a Bel-Air fundraiser Wednesday night for him., This country needs fresh thinking. It needs fresh ideas and thats what Ben Carson can supply, Estes said, noting that in next weeks Simi Valley debate he wants to see Carson show that hes qualified to lead on foreign policy and other issues., Lori Martino, a nurse from Chino Hills who was at the rally, said Carsons National Prayer Breakfast remarks caught her eye., I paid attention to him and followed him since, said Martino as she waited for Carson to take the stage in Anaheim. Hes experienced in a different way.  He has life experience., Staff writer Mark Z.

{"Content": "[[, For discerning, super-wealthy donors looking for a distinctive way to advertise clout, the 2016 presidential election offers a new perk  their own specially tailored \"super PAC.\", Political professionals working on behalf of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and for former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, both Republicans, have set up multiple super PACs with nearly identical names, all in the interest of catering to the wishes of the well-heeled, particularly the moguls willing to write seven-figure checks., The idea is to convince these donors they will have a measure of control over how their money is spent., \"Whether they have $5,000 or $5 million, they want to be able to participate in the process and give their thoughts and ideas,\" said Austin Barbour, main strategist for the three super PACs backing Perry  all bearing the name Opportunity and Freedom., \"When they tell you things in this business, you better respond positively to what they are saying,\" said Barbour, a Mississippi-based political consultant and veteran of Mitt Romneys 2012 campaign., The 2016 presidential race is already dominated by super PACs and other groups that under federal law can take unlimited checks. In Perrys case, for example, the trio of super PACs account for nearly all the money raised for his campaign so far, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission., More than 80% of the money came from just three donors, who put in a total of $15.3 million. The largest sum, $6.3 million, came from Kelcy Warren, an oil and gas pipeline billionaire from Dallas; an additional $5 million came from another Dallas billionaire, Darwin Deason. A $4-million contribution came in from a third donor whose name has not been released., Warren is not a typical, passive donor; he also serves as finance chairman of Perrys campaign. In February, Perry took a seat on the board of directors of Warrens firm, Energy Transfer Partners. Warren was at a Washington hotel recently when Perry, appearing at an Opportunity and Freedom event, gave a speech denouncing GOP rival Donald Trump as a \"barking carnival act\"  and saying that the nation needed to expand energy production and end a ban on energy exports., Warren and Deason declined requests for comment., Cruz has four affiliated PACs, all called Keep the Promise, that have together raised about $38 million, according to disclosure reports., One of the groups is the repository for contributions from Robert Mercer, a hedge fund billionaire from New York, who gave Cruz $11 million. Another was set up for Dan and Farris Wilks, brothers from Texas who made billions by selling equipment for fracking of oil and gas wells and gave $15 million with their spouses., The third took in $10 million from Toby Neugebauer, the founder of a private equity firm whose father, Randy, is a Republican congressman from Texas. The fourth brought in $1.8 million from several donors who are wealthy, but not rich enough to command their own PACs., Though super PACs can accept unlimited amounts of money to support candidates, they must disclose donors, and they cant coordinate activities with the candidates campaigns  although campaigns this year have increasingly pushed the boundaries when it comes to coordination., Turning such a PAC into an individualized accessory is one of the latest wrinkles in the money race., The tactic stems in part from a still-lingering hangover of 2012. Romneys defeat and the implosions of several GOP Senate candidates that year left some heavyweight Republican donors feeling they had not gotten good value for their money., \"A lot of people felt burned,\" said Edward Crane, a founder of the libertarian Cato Institute and president of Purple PAC, one of three super PACs supporting Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.)., The tactic comes with some risk. One Republican operative who asked not to be identified because he is working for a rival candidates super PAC called the strategy \"head-scratching.\" Having multiple PACs will make for a lot of complications when the time comes to spend money, the operative said., Maybe one donor only wants his money spent on positive ads, he said, or another will want to see his dollars go to ads in his home state  even when research from the campaign suggests that the money should be spent differently., \"You now have to jump through hoops and spend money inefficiently, because of a commitment youve made to a donor to give them some level of control over the PAC,\" he said, adding that such obstacles may end up \"diluting the message.\", \"I have to imagine its driven by donors,\" he said. \"You wouldnt do it otherwise.\", In the case of the Perry campaign, Barbour said there wouldnt be clashing agendas from the super PACs because he will be running the operations for all three groups. Donors will be consulted but wont make the final decisions, he said., \"Well see if it works,\" he said. \"I see the way donors like it.\", The proliferation of super PACs comes as the outside groups assume higher profiles not only in fundraising, but in taking on more and more functions that once were run by the candidates own campaign organizations., A Republican campaign lawyer said he doubted that the outside-group operations would prove as effective as efforts run directly by the campaigns., \"Theres a marketing element going on here,\" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he is advising other candidates. \"A lot of these efforts are inefficient. Im a little old-school. I really think campaign money, in the end, will prove to be the most valuable.\", He was referring to the money donated directly to candidates. Such donations have tighter restrictions and are capped at $2,700 per person, but the dollars go further because candidates are by law given the lowest rates for buying television advertising, among other things., Another potential risk is tripping over the rules that ban coordination. David Keating, president of the Center for Competitive Politics, which advocates removing restrictions on campaign spending, says he thinks Warrens roles as Perrys finance chairman and mega-donor risk violating those rules. Violations could happen, he said, if Warren were privy to campaign information and then got involved in making decisions for the PAC., \"If hes someone whos a finance chair for the campaign, it wouldnt be a very good move for him to do anything else except give money,\" Keating said. \"He might not know of any intentions or plans for the campaign, but I think people might have a hard time believing that.\", Stefan C. Passantino, a campaign finance lawyer in Washington, set up the Cruz and Perry super PACs. Having donors to a super PAC be involved in raising money creates no problem, he said  so long as no one shares inside strategic information., \"The campaign cant tell the super PAC what their plans are on spending or on public communications,\" Passantino said. \"Being the finance director in the room isnt anywhere close to that., \"Its not an issue.\", The three groups backing Paul have set themselves apart by focusing on different tasks. One group, Concerned American Voters, is concentrating on grass-roots organizing and get-out-the-vote efforts, particularly in Iowa, which holds the nations first nominating contest. The group says it has raised close to $2million and, with 40 staff members, already has knocked on more than 235,000 doors in the state., Purple PAC, meanwhile, will spend money on social media, and Americas Liberty PAC will focus on advertising., \"Were able to leverage slightly different donor universes,\" said Jesse Benton, who runs Americas Liberty., \"We all realize its not a zero-sum game. There are some donors who really believe advertising is the way of the past, and the ground game is really the thing they want to see their money spent on. Then American Voters is the place for them.\", However the work gets divvied up, the era of multiple super PACs backing candidates is here to stay, Barbour predicted., \"Its sort of the wave of the future of fundraising at this level,\" he said., Twitter: @jtanfani, Staff writer David Lauter contributed to this report.]", "Date": "20150802", "Title": "[New 'super PACs' help 2016 mega-donors customize their political clout]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-personal-super-pacs-20150802-story.html", "Author": "[Joseph Tanfani]"}
{"Content": "[[, For four years, Rep. Darrell Issa presided over one of the highest-profile oversight committees in Congress, becoming a fixture in the national news as he took the Obama administration to task for everything from bank bailouts to corruption in Afghanistan., Only three months ago, the California congressman unveiled a portrait of himself to hang proudly in the committee hearing room., \"Click LIKE to thank Chairman Issa for his tireless commitment to transparency and for his dedicated service to the American people,\" the oversight committee Facebook page suggested as the portrait was hung., Just days after his successor took over at the helm in January, though, the new painting vanished from the hearing room. It now hangs in a private committee anteroom, beside a coat rack and a television screen., Its journey echoes the waning influence of the Vista Republican, whose confrontational style managed to wear not only on Democrats, but on members of his own party., Issa used his position atop the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to relentlessly poke at President Obama over Benghazi, the Internal Revenue Service, the \"Fast and Furious\" failed gun sting, and any number of topics that made for high theater and cable cameos. But Issas investigations often failed to show direct culpability on the part of the White House or Obama, whom he once called \"one of the most corrupt presidents in modern times.\", Issas influence began to wane last year, when party leaders diverted attention from his high-drama investigation of the deadly 2012 attack against U.S. personnel in Benghazi, Libya, by establishing a new committee to focus on the incident., Then they thwarted his attempt to secure a rare exception to the limit on how long he could lead the oversight committee. (He served one term as the committees top Republican, when Democrats held the majority, and then a pair of two-year terms as its chairman.), His successor, fellow Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah, campaigned to succeed Issa on a promise to run the committee differently. When he took over in January, Chaffetz replaced many of Issas staff members and engineered the move of portraits of Issa and other former chairmen., \"Darrell Issa didnt do many reports,\" Chaffetz told reporters in December, after Republican leaders tapped him, according to Roll Call. \"[He] did big press releases.\", \"Its not the Jason Chaffetz Show,\" he said at another point., Issa, now beginning his eighth term in Congress, finds himself at a crossroads., Despite a personal fortune that gives him a huge advantage in elections, there was little clamoring among California Republicans for him to reprise a run for the Senate seat that Democrat Barbara Boxer will relinquish after the 2016 election. Issa spent $10 million trying to unseat her in 1998 but failed to win the Republican nomination., He appears unlikely to follow the path of one of his predecessors in the post, former Rep. Henry A. Waxman of Beverly Hills, a Democrat who left Congress this year after four decades with a legacy as a legislative titan. Two factors get in Issas way: The Republican Party imposes term limits on its chairmen, and many members of the party philosophically oppose the type of sweeping legislation championed by Waxman and other liberals., Issas allies say he retains leverage; he is a key ally to Silicon Valley, leading a subcommittee that oversees patents. And Issa has succeeded before in surprising ways, even as he took on a highly partisan role: He worked with Democrats to oppose anti-piracy measures that opponents said would undermine free speech on the Internet., His new committee assignments  he was also named to the House Foreign Affairs Committee in December  will put him in the middle of compelling issues., \"Hes very much going to be active and robust in policy and intellectual property issues, which is really in his wheelhouse,\" said Kurt Bardella, a former aide to Issa who is now a private media consultant. Issa, who made his fortune manufacturing anti-theft devices for cars, has held 37 patents, according to his office., Issa declined a request to discuss his plans or past performance. When a reporter approached him in a House hallway to request an interview, he refused and said that the result would be a \"hit piece.\", Just a few minutes later, the committee Issa used to lead met for the first time since he handed over the gavel to Chaffetz. The top Democrat on the committee, Maryland Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, opened his remarks with a call for a \"new beginning.\", \"The last four years were filled with acrimony, partisanship and sometimes vulgar displays,\" Cummings said. \"They were a stain on this committees integrity and an embarrassment to the House of Representatives.\", Cummings was a principal figure in one of Issas most controversial moves, which occurred during a hearing last year that was devoted to IRS scrutiny given to some conservative groups tax-exempt status., Issa, angry after former IRS Director Lois Lerner pleaded the 5th Amendment to avoid answering questions, called the meeting adjourned even as Cummings tried to speak. Cummings protested that it was a \"one-sided investigation\" as Issa shut down the Democrats microphone and began to leave., \"I am a member of the Congress of the United States of America. I am tired of this,\" Cummings said, his arm shaking and his words echoing through the large chamber even without amplification. The dispute, caught on video, spread widely over social media., For many, the incident illustrated how decorum had fallen in Congress, as genteel formalities have given way to unvarnished contempt among partisans. But it specifically tarnished Issa and contributed to Republicans distancing themselves from him., In a 348-page report, Issa cited a number of accomplishments from his four years at the helm of the oversight committee. They include 23 laws passed, including the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act, which required federal agencies to put more detailed budget information online for public scrutiny. Issa also pointed to more than 100 subpoenas he issued  a tactic that critics have assailed as excessive  and to nearly 60 reports released., But some of the highest-profile investigations have failed to live up to the initial hype. For example, his final investigation on the IRS targeting conservative groups failed to show evidence of White House involvement, despite Issas statement in 2013 that \"this was a targeting of the presidents political enemies\" that was discovered only after Obamas reelection. His statement last year that he suspected former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton had told former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta to \"stand down\" during the attack on Americans in Benghazi was not substantiated by two separate congressional reports., Yet even some Democrats say that Issa helped Republicans make significant gains in the November election., \"Theres no question he accomplished part of his mission, which was to do damage to the president,\" said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, a Virginia Democrat who serves on the oversight committee. \"The relentless headline-grabbing, breathless subpoenas and hearings and charges certainly served a purpose, even though there was very little there there, it turns out.\", For Republicans wishing to put the Issa years behind them, Chaffetz  with a youthful perma-smile and a tangle of dark hair that conjures membership in a boy band  was a logical choice to replace him. Chaffetz made a deliberate show of unity with Cummings when he campaigned for the job among his colleagues, traveling with Cummings to his Baltimore district and inviting the Democrat to dine on cheesy potatoes with Chaffetzs constituents in Utah., \"Were going to be equally as aggressive,\" Chaffetz said in a recent interview. \"I just want to make sure it doesnt get too personal with other members of the committee.\", Chaffetz has insisted his removal of Issas portrait from the committee room was not personal. He removed other portraits, replacing them with tributes to postal workers, coal miners, civil rights marchers and other iconic American images., \"I think we should be inspired by those that we serve, not necessarily the other former committee chairmen,\" Chaffetz said., But even as Chaffetz has tried to move on, his colleagues cant resist chuckling. One of them, Rep. Mick Mulvaney, walked by while Chaffetz was speaking with a Times reporter for this story., \"So, has he asked you about the portraits yet?\" Mulvaney, a South Carolina Republican, asked Chaffetz with a grin., Former Rep. Tom Davis, a Virginia Republican who led the committee from 2003 to 2007, said Issa was a \"pretty good chairman\" in a tough spot  caught among partisans who demanded that he go after Obama, party leaders who worried that his overreaching could hurt Republicans among swing voters and Democrats who defended the president by demonizing Issa. Davis, who chaired the committee under Republican President George W. Bush, often pursued a less partisan agenda, including an examination of the response to mad cow disease, the implementation of the Department of Homeland Security, and private contracts related to the war in Iraq., Davis says Issa is in a strong position to remain influential., \"This is a guy whos landed well,\" he said. \"Hes got still a great role to play and hes very strong with the party base.\", noah.bierman@latimes.com, Twitter:@noahbierman, ALSO:, Obama gave no secret instructions to FCC on net neutrality: Wheeler, Secret Service director pledges commitment to fixing agencys ills, Obamacare advisor apologizes to lawmakers for controversial comments]", "Date": "20150320", "Title": "[California's Darrell Issa loses power along with House oversight committee post]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-darrell-issa-20150321-story.html", "Author": "[Noah Bierman ]"}
{"Content": "[[, For many in this slice of the West, the presidential campaign is little more than a vague notion, distant as a faint speck on the horizon., The candidates, to hear them tell it, include Huckleberry (that would be Mike Huckabee), the black doctor (Ben Carson), some guy from Texas (actually, there are two of them) and Mitt Romney (no, not this time)., Theres all this yakking on TV, said Stephen Bellack, a Democrat, but not a whole lot has captured the attention of the 68-year-old veteran of the merchant marine., The exception, naturally, is Donald Trump, whose loud, bumptious, mad bull of a presidential campaign cant help but be noticed. He is the only candidate, other than Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Democratic side, whom everyone can name and who elicits no shortage of strong opinions., A buffoon. A joke.

But he knows business, and our country should be run like a business., Nevada enjoys a privileged place on the 2016 presidential calendar, designated by the two major parties as one of the earliest-voting states: third for Democrats and fourth for Republicans. So voters here could play an important role in helping cull the field on both sides., But the state is not exactly crawling with White House contestants, especially compared with Iowa and New Hampshire, the earliest-voting states, where the presidential hopefuls have lavished the majority of their time and resources., Nevada voters mainly know what they read about the candidates or learn from television. And since the real estate moguls sledgehammer entry into the race, the TV coverage has been virtually all Trump, all the time., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, Whether the steady diet of outrage, insults and hyperbole -- his healthcare plan, Trump said on CNN, was to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something terrific -- is good or bad can depend on ones party loyalties., Trump! exclaimed a grinning Bud Guy. He just never stops!, Guy, a chemical salesman and Democrat who supports Clinton, figures Trumps incendiary comments on illegal immigration that have antagonized many Latino voters, and his disparagement of other GOP hopefuls -- labeling Rick Perry a hypocrite, John Kasich a typical pol, Scott Walker a flip-flopper -- can only help the eventual Democratic nominee., I hope he keeps it up, said Guy, 73, toting his gym bag as he headed to an afternoon workout. I just love to see all the controversy!, Thats precisely what worries Ken Stoehrmann. The 65-year-old retired Air Force veteran, a Republican, is a long way from picking a candidate for president. But it wont be Trump, Stoehrmann said, dismissing his campaign as smoke and mirrors., The problem is \"its hurting the Republican Party,\" Stoehrmann said, \"because whoever gets the nomination, theyre going to try to pin Trumps words on to\" that person., For some critics, the antagonism goes beyond partisan considerations. They liken Trump to a gaseous cloud, expanding to block out other, more viable candidates and smothering serious discussion., Keith Lee, 72, a longtime lobbyist and political operative in Reno, scowled from a barbers chair as Shelly Whitehead worked an electric shaver over his close-cropped scalp. Trump, he said, has no more business running for president than my hunting dog., Hes in there sucking all the air out of legitimate debate, sucking all the air out of legitimate media coverage of the issues and the other candidates, said Lee, who is a Democrat by registration but independent by inclination., Whitehead, 52 and a faithful Democrat, nodded her assent. He seems like hes in there for his own ego, redirecting from more important issues, she said., But just down the street from her Scissors & Comb barbershop, outside Washoe Countys justice building, retired FBI agent Michael Jack credited Trump with single-handedly bringing substance to the campaign by raising issues, such as problems on the U.S.-Mexico border, that others are too timid to mention., Hes loud, yes. He does take up a lot of air in the room, said Jack, 61, a Republican who now runs a private investigative firm. But hes calling it like it really is and theres a lot of [politically correct] people out there who say, Thats racism. Its not racism. Its reality., For some, its tiresome., Allison Judge, a bookkeeper and self-described tree-hugging liberal, used an expletive to dismiss the voluble billionaire. \"Hes just got hateful things to say,\" said Judge, 60, and a fan of Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders, Vermonts socialist senator. \"I dont think [Trump has] got constructive solutions.\", So she has laid down the law: Anyone posting anything on her Facebook page having to do with Trump -- positive or negative -- will be immediately blocked until he leaves the race.

{"Content": "[[, For Mark Ulatowski, the opportunity to see Donald Trump  brash, fiery and unapologetic as ever  was well worth the three-hour drive north from his home near the U.S.-Mexico border., \"He speaks to me. He speaks to a lot of us, because he speaks the truth,\" said Ulatowski, a U.S. Army veteran who made the trek Saturday to see the real estate mogul turned reality television star, and now GOP presidential hopeful, denounce illegal immigration and castigate Democrats and fellow Republicans alike., \"Its not just about him actually standing up and fighting against illegal immigration,\" said Ulatowski as he stood in 100-degree heat alongside thousands waiting to enter the sprawling downtown convention center. \"He says what politicians would never say, and thats refreshing.\", A blunt-spoken hero to fans like Ulatowski, an exasperating blowhard to his many critics, Trump seized the spotlight in the Republican presidential campaign with his inflammatory comments about Mexican immigrants, and for more than two weeks has refused to relinquish center stage despite increasingly frantic pleas from GOP officials., His denunciations of illegal immigrants and foreign competitors, from China to Mexico, have struck a chord with millions of voters  particularly older, white conservatives, polls indicate  who feel that most politicians have ignored their concerns. Their backing has propelled Trump to the front rank of the splintered GOP field., At the same time, Trumps words have harmed the partys already tenuous efforts to attract minority voters, particularly Latinos, whom a Republican presidential nominee would need to win key states in the 2016 election. And the cautious and tentative comments that most of the other GOP candidates have made in response have highlighted how narrow a path the party must tread if it hopes to win the presidency  trying to reach out to minority voters while fearing to alienate the conservative whites who have formed the GOPs base of support in recent elections., In an appearance here that coupled fiery rhetoric with over-the-top displays of self-love  \"I went to the Wharton School of Finance; Im, like, a really smart person,\" he declared at one point  Trump reinforced both parts of his image. He served up the sort of blunt talk that his supporters praise along with lines that critics cite when they label him an overweening narcissist., His supporters, he said, were a \"silent majority\" who would be able to tilt the Republican presidential primaries, which will begin seven months from now, in his favor., Appearing with Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a fierce foe of illegal immigration, Trump did not limit himself to immigration issues. At various points, he took on President Obama (\"You know I dont use teleprompters like the president  I speak from the heart\"), Caroline Kennedy, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Jeb Bush, NBC and Univision., He offered few specifics for a campaign, other than to insist hed do a better job than either Clinton or Bush  two candidates on opposite sides of the aisle who come from political dynasties that many of his backers see as symbols of an unresponsive political establishment., Thats been enough to push Trump forward. In a Reuters-Ipsos poll released Saturday, Bush and Trump were tied at 15% for the lead nationwide in the Republican field., The Reuters survey was the second national poll in recent days showing Trump with about 15% of the GOP vote and in the top tier of the crowded field. An Economist/YouGov survey showed Trump was one of the Republican front-runners and simultaneously its most widely disliked candidate., Almost half of voters surveyed had a \"very unfavorable\" view of Trump, the survey found, including almost 1 in 3 registered Republicans  far more than for any other GOP candidate., The poll also indicated that many of his backers didnt necessarily expect Trump to win. Only 7% of those surveyed called Trump the \"most likely\" to gain the nomination., At one point in his speech, protesters began to shout at Trump as they held signs, assailing him as a racist. \"I wonder if the Mexican government sent them over here,\" Trump said as the protesters, many of them Latino, were escorted from the convention hall by security., \"Dont worry, well take our country back,\" he said as the crowd cheered., That was one of several times the crowd responded with cheers, sometimes of \"U-S-A!\"  sometimes with \"Build the wall!\" when he pledged to erect a wall along the entire length of the southern border., Trump frequently criticized the Mexican government, although he insisted he had no conflict with the country or the Mexican people. \"I respect Mexico, but their leaders are too smart for our leaders, because we have stupid leaders, OK?\" Trump said, to more cheers and chants of \"U-S-A!\", Supporters here said they admired what they saw as Trumps honesty., \"He calls a spade a spade and is the only one willing to say it like it is,\" said Jim Wines, a registered Republican from Surprise, Ariz. \"Id vote for him to be president today.\", Diane Sapiro stood few feet behind Wines in a line that snaked several city blocks before Trumps arrival. She wore a button that read \"Make America great again,\" adorned with a picture of a scowling Trump. Sapiro said she was an unaffiliated voter, disenchanted by both Democrats and Republicans., \"Hes arrogant and a little cocky, but when he talks, hes saying stuff I agree with,\" said the Chandler, Ariz., resident. \"Illegals coming across the border are an issue here.\", By contrast, top Republicans in Arizona, including Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake and Gov. Doug Ducey, did not attend., Both McCain and Flake supported a bipartisan comprehensive immigration proposal that passed the Senate in 2013 but ultimately stalled in the Republican-controlled House. In interviews last week, McCain, the GOPs 2008 presidential nominee, lambasted Trumps remarks as \"offensive,\" saying that a majority of Arizonans would disagree with his views., Trump shot back, telling reporters that McCain was \"very weak on immigration.\", Stan Barnes, a Republican strategist based in Phoenix, said there was \"a large and important segment of the electorate not just here in Arizona, but nationally, who view illegal immigration as the top problem facing the federal government.\", \"Trumps willingness to approach this issue directly has electrified that voter, and were seeing it play a role in the race.\", Angel McConnell, who traveled from her ranch in a rural development outside of Scottsdale, Ariz., agreed., \"He has the momentum,\" she said. \"If we stay with him, the sky is the limit.

{"Content": "[[, For months, Rep. Steve Knight (R-Palmdale) has appeared on a prominent list of congressmen who opposed the Export-Import Bank., That position won him the admiration of Tea Party groups and other conservatives, who abhor the bank as an example of crony capitalism and have made its destruction their top goal., So it was a big surprise this weekend when Knight was quoted in a Los Angeles Daily News column saying that letting the banks charter lapse would put \"American jobs at risk.\", When asked for a clarification Monday, his office issued an even stronger statement of support, arguing that small businesses in his district depend on the bank., \"If we allow the bank to close its doors, the families that I serve who rely on these businesses for their well-being would suffer immensely, and that is unacceptable,\" he wrote., \"I acknowledge that reforms are necessary, but we cant do that on a one-year basis and so I support reauthorization, he added., So how did Knight appear to hold two different positions on such a divisive issue?, It began during last years campaign, when Knight filled out a questionnaire for the local professional aerospace union. The questionnaire asked whether Knight supported reauthorizing the \"U.S. Export-Import Bank.\", Knight responded \"I do not support reauthorizing the Ibank,\" according to the survey, which is posted online., That response was picked up by Heritage Action for America, a conservative political group, which used his position to grade his performance as a conservative lawmaker.

{"Content": "[[, For most of the year, it seemed almost certain that Republicans would win the six additional U.S. Senate seats they need to oust the Democrats from their majority and take control of Congress., But the outlook has turned murkier in recent weeks. While a GOP majority is still the most likely outcome, its no longer as sure a bet. Endangered Democratic incumbents in North Carolina and Alaska are waging surprisingly strong campaigns, and a Republican incumbent in Kansas is in unexpected trouble. \"We dont have a lock on this thing at all,\" one GOP strategist told me recently., It even seems possible that Senate elections could end in a draw, with a 50-50 split, in which case Vice President Joe Biden would cast votes as a tiebreaker., And thats not even the most exotic possibility., One scenario is a Senate in which neither major party wins 50 seats. The next Senate will include two, maybe three independents. Incumbents Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine, whose seats arent up this year, may be joined by Greg Orman, a newcomer who leads the polls in Kansas. Sanders, a socialist, would continue to vote with Democrats, but King and Orman, both centrists, would be wooed by both parties  and could instantly become two of the most powerful politicians on Capitol Hill., We could see senators switching sides. Republicans are talking hopefully about persuading Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), the Senates most conservative Democrat, to cross the aisle and sit with them. Manchin has so far dismissed the idea, but that wont stop the GOP from trying., And the Senates makeup could be in doubt for months after the election. In Louisiana, if no candidate wins 50%, the state holds a runoff on Dec. 6  and thats likely to happen, since the \"jungle ballot\" includes three Republicans running against incumbent Democrat Mary L. Landrieu. In Georgia, if no candidate wins 50%, the state holds a runoff on Jan. 6  one day after the new Senate convenes. In other tight races, recounts could take months; Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) waged an eight-month recount battle before claiming his seat in 2009., But the most intriguing scenario for next years Senate, paradoxically, is the least exotic one: What happens if Republicans win a slim majority of 51 or 52 seats?, The party would then be like the dog who caught the car and has to figure out what to do with it. When the two houses of Congress have been held by different parties, gridlock has made governance almost impossible. But if the GOP controls both the Senate and the House, its members will be under pressure to govern. At least in the Senate, where 60 votes are needed to move major legislation, theyll even have an incentive to compromise to rescue their wholly owned legislative branch from the dank cellar of public esteem., \"To elect a president in 2016, were going to have to show in 2015 and 16 that the American people can trust Republicans with the government,\" Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), a leading GOP deal-maker, said recently., But that wont be easy., For one thing, the Senate GOP is deeply divided. On one side are pragmatic conservatives such as Alexander and Ohios Rob Portman, who want to pass a budget, rein in federal regulations and maybe even tackle tax reform  and are willing to work with Democrats to do it., Portman even sounds enthusiastic about the prospect, pointing to earlier eras when Presidents Reagan and Clinton negotiated successfully with opposition majorities., \"I know I may sound naive,\" he said, but \"when we have divided government, thats when weve done tax reform; thats when weve done entitlement reform.\", Opposing them from within the party, however, is the take-no-prisoners caucus of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), conservatives who want to send uncompromising bills to the White House (beginning with the repeal of Obamacare) and force President Obama to veto them., The man in the middle is Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the GOP leader, who wants to do a little of each., When he talks to conservative donors and voters, McConnell sounds as ferocious as any tea party militant., Obama \"needs to be challenged, and the best way to do that is through the funding process,\" McConnell told Politico last month. \"Were going to pass spending bills, and theyre going to have a lot of restrictions on the activities of the bureaucracy.\", But when he realized that sounded as if he were threatening a government shutdown, McConnell told reporters that wasnt what he meant. \"Im the guy who gets us out of government shutdowns,\" he insisted., Can the GOPs pragmatists resist their partys swing to the right, strike alliances with centrist Democrats and actually pass important legislation next year?, The odds appear stacked against them.

{"Content": "[[, For much of her 17 years as a financial planner, Molly Vogt never imagined shed become a political activist. But she was outraged by the financial crisis, launching an economy-focused womens group called \"My Purse Politics\" and ultimately taking a full-time job with Americans for Prosperity. She calls it a role she will fill \"until I can get government out of my way.\", As a field director in Colorado, Vogt is one of more than 500 paid foot soldiers across the country for the conservative nonprofit group, funded in part by the Koch brothers, that advocates for limited government. For much of this year, she and nearly three dozen other staffers in the state have helped build Americans for Prosperitys data-driven effort: amassing teams of volunteers who go door to door collecting information on voters and the national and local issues that matter to them  such as the presidents healthcare law and school choice., Now, Vogts days are centered on turning that data into votes for Republican Rep. Cory Gardner, who is trying to unseat Democratic Sen. Mark Udall in one of Novembers tightest and most important races., In a year when Democrats have focused on issues such as abortion and birth control, Vogt feels a personal responsibility to get women fired up about the governments role in healthcare, and the financial and housing markets. \"This year was the first time I knocked on a door, because I just got so fed up with what was going on,\" she said., The art of political persuasion can be complex. Television ads  whether uplifting or testily negative  have long been the key vehicle for defining candidates to voters. But the second necessity  getting them to cast their votes  has increasingly rested on meticulously organized, technologically powered, repetitive contact by people like Vogt who identify prospective voters and help close the deal., In Colorado and other states, the two national parties and their allies are sweeping through the suburbs with the dedication of advancing armies. Americans for Prosperity alone has knocked on 140,000 doors since June., Such conservative groups are both ascendant and playing catchup to Democratic field operations in key states. Their efforts this year are meant to deliver results in November and create the template for the presidential race in 2016. Americans for Prosperity President Tim Phillips says emphatically that the group is in the field to stay in competitive states including Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire and Florida  the mightiest of swing states, where the group has 50 full- and part-time staffers., He notes that for years, the left had the advantage of \"a powerful force on the ground that was outside the Democratic Party\": government employee unions, environmental groups and community groups., \"They had an army,\" Phillips said. But on the right, \"there really was not a permanent infrastructure with professional staff, the ability to mobilize activists on a large scale, with a consistent stream of funding. So at Americans for Prosperity, weve spent a decade now working to build just that.\", But they are facing fierce competition, not only from outside Democratic groups. In Colorado, Democrats say their field team is about three times the size it was in 2010 when it helped notch a narrow victory for the states other Democratic senator, Michael Bennet, with an average margin of one vote per precinct., Bennets effort that election was so successful in boosting turnout among sporadic Democratic voters that the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee invested $60 million to replicate it across the country this year as the so-called Bannock Street Project, which takes its name from the Denver street where Bennets campaign office was located., With Republicans outmatched in 2012 by the Democrats wealth of data and precise turnout operation, the national GOP this cycle has invested $105 million in improving its ability to track voters interests and willingness to go to the polls  or in Colorados case, the mailbox, since this year every voter will be able to cast a ballot by mail for the first time., The GOP efforts in states such as Colorado are bolstered by outside groups like Americans for Prosperity. But the group operates independently and has built its own database of voters. \"You want to be able to hold the party that is your erstwhile ally accountable,\" Phillips said., Because it was set up as a \"social welfare\" nonprofit organization, Americans for Prosperity does not have to disclose its donors, and did not have to detail its spending to the Federal Election Commission until 60 days before the election. But the group financed by the Koch brothers, the billionaire backers of conservative political causes, demonstrated its deep pockets in 2012, when it spent $122 million attempting to defeat President Obama and other Democrats, according to an analysis by the Center for Public Integrity., In that race, Americans for Prosperity plowed most of its money into advertising. It is still one of the biggest spenders on advertising this year  approaching more than $50 million., But it has made a far greater investment this year in canvassing and related endeavors than in 2012. Its most recent mailing in Colorado was a report card detailing how often each recipient had voted compared with four neighbors with a perfect voting history  a gentle, data-driven nudge to return their ballots., Follow-up comes in the form of people like Vogt. IPad in hand, her red curly hair tucked in a ponytail, Vogt and three of her part-time \"field associates\"  in the groups corporate lingo  made quick work of the dozens of houses that appeared in that days \"walk-books,\" which are assigned by operatives at the field office and transmitted to the associates iPads in real time., Carefully trained on technology and door etiquette during a several-day seminar in Wisconsin this year, Vogt  in jeans, sneakers, and a blue T-shirt bearing the image of Ronald Reagan and the Americans for Prosperity logo  stands back at a respectful distance from the door., At one point this year, Vogt was asking voters questions about their beliefs on taxes, healthcare and education  voter identification scripts that Americans for Prosperity often tried to keep under a minute to maximize the willingness of people to respond. Now, Vogt cheerfully thanks them for voting in 2012 and asks whether they plan to return their ballot. She enters the data on her iPad  lighting up houses where she has gotten a \"commitment\" in green, and houses where no one was home in red. She will return a few days later with a different script to gauge candidate preference. Once she has determined that a vote has been cast  based on data from the secretary of state  those voters will be cleared from the organizations list so Vogt and her colleagues can move on to other targets., She can see which homes her team has hit along the block in real time. There is a brief stop late in the day for chocolate milkshakes  \"We get a little punch drunk,\" Vogt says with a laugh  but they keep up a brisk pace before heading to the office. Every canvasser gets a progress report at the end of each day, creating friendly competition among the teams across the state., Less than six miles from where Vogts team was canvassing, the Democratic competition  staff and volunteers from Udalls team and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee  were massing at their campaign headquarters in Aurora., Launching their own intensive ground effort as ballots began arriving at voters homes, as many as 100 Democratic volunteers and staffers packed into the field office, decorated with red, white and blue streamers and colorful hand-painted signs with slogans including \"Keep Colorado Blue.\", Bennet served as the warmup act for Udall as the two senators rallied volunteers before an evening of canvassing. He notes that Udalls team has recruited four times as many active volunteers  those who have completed a shift in the last three weeks  as his team did in 2010 and that the field staff is nearly three times as large. (A Republican National Committee spokeswoman said it had tripled its field team in Colorado since 2012, but she would not offer details.), After a cheer, volunteers disperse to the neighborhoods, much as their Republican counterparts had. In near darkness, Dave Lightowler and Michael Briefs work off their illuminated iPads  stopping to review the voter data that they have for each house before approaching the door. At one, they catch a Democrat who registered recently  but admits hes had little time to figure out who is running. They leave a packet of information and mark the house as one to which they will return., Half a block down, an independent voter is less receptive. As soon as the volunteers mention the names of Democratic candidates, he slams the door with a curt \"forget it.\", Lightowler enters him as a \"refusal,\" but notes that they still dont know his wifes voting plans. He vows to return. \"We dont skip anyone,\" he said. \"As a canvasser, I want to be sure. This is the playoffs.\", That Democratic relentlessness helped Obama win in Colorado and other swing states. The question is whether Republicans and allied groups like Americans for Prosperity now have the muscle to catch up., maeve.reston@latimes.com, Twitter: @maevereston]", "Date": "20141025", "Title": "[In key election states, conservative groups build a ground game]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-afp-data-wars-20141026-story.html", "Author": "[Maeve Reston]"}
{"Content": "[[, For New Hampshires Republican Party, the swarm of likely presidential candidates about to blanket the state has been preceded by another much-appreciated influx: money., There was the recent contribution of $10,000 from Jeb Bushs leadership political action committee, Right to Rise, ahead of a visit this week to the Granite State, his first since announcing he is exploring a run for the White House. Months earlier, $5,000 each came from leadership PACs established by Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida, two other presidential prospects eager to make friends in the state that will hold the first 2016 primary., \"Were a pivotal state in the election process, so its no surprise candidates are showing interest here,\" said Jennifer Horn, the state GOP chairwoman., At this stage of the 2016 campaign, the leadership PAC has become a vehicle of choice for presidential candidates. Common among members of Congress, but a relatively new device for those not holding federal office, such PACs enable prospective candidates to build donor lists, travel to early primary states and court future support by contributing to local officials and state parties, without having to formally declare a candidacy., \"It can be used as a warm-up to the main attraction,\" said Anthony Corrado, a professor of government at Colby College in Maine who has done extensive research on campaign finance., Unlike independent super PACs, which can receive unlimited contributions, leadership PACs can accept $5,000 per year from individual donors or other political action committees. Limits to how much these PACs can donate vary from $10,000 to state parties to about $5,000 to candidates per election. In the two years leading up to Novembers midterm election, 496 leadership PACs spent $47 million on federal candidates, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics., Money raised by the PACs cannot go toward the candidates formal campaign, although the currying of influence in early or influential states will certainly be beneficial., Last year, Reinventing a New Direction, or RANDPAC, established by Paul in 2011, contributed a combined $15,000 to the GOP in early voting states like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, according to Federal Election Commission reports., Meanwhile, Rubios Reclaim America donated a total of $10,000 to state parties in Iowa and New Hampshire. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, launched his political action committee, RickPAC, last summer and gave $10,000 to the New Hampshire GOP and $5,000 to South Carolina Republicans., The money sent to influential politicians has been equally sizable. Bush announced he contributed about $31,200 to House and Senate candidates from early voting states., \"These are all candidates Gov. Bush is supportive of and who are up for reelection in 2016,\" spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said. \"Obviously they are in critical states, but its important to note that these are just the first round of contributions.\", Before the November election, RANDPAC gave about $14,300 to federal candidates from Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina; Reclaim America handed out about $22,000 and RickPAC $17,900 to candidates in those states. The Jobs, Growth and Freedom Fund, the leadership PAC of Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, gave $30,000 to federal GOP candidates from those states. These totals do not include the tens of thousands that the PACs also handed out through independent expenditures to support candidates such as Joni Ernst of Iowa, who won a competitive Senate contest, and Scott Brown, who failed to unseat Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire., Candidates and state parties in places like California and Texas, where primary voters cast ballots much later, have seen almost no donations from these PACs. (Bush is the only candidate to release tallies from this year; in odd years, PACs have the option of filing quarterly or semiannually.), Because of federal limits, the sums given to candidates are relatively small compared with the millions these PACs rake in. In the last two years, RANDPAC raised about $3.7 million, and Reclaim America brought in $3.9 million  two of the highest sums of any Senate leadership PACs., \"Sen. Paul is proud to have crisscrossed the country in the 2014 cycle on behalf of his ideas and of candidates nationwide,\" Doug Stafford, executive director of RANDPAC, said in an email. \"The PAC also built a nationwide donor and activist network to support those endeavors.\", Much of the cash raised by the PACs has gone toward travel, fundraising, consulting, polling and research, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Expenses for RANDPAC included $4,983 in equipment at an Arlington, Va., Apple store and $2,050 in hotel fees at Caesars Palace on the Las Vegas Strip., \"This is a good way to build name identification in critical states that helps down the road,\" said Viveca Novak, editorial and communications director at the Center for Responsive Politics. \"And when looking at the contributions, its clear that theyre targeted toward certain candidates in certain states.\", Republicans may have a more active palette of leadership PACs, because the party has far more presidential prospects than Democrats have, but they are not alone in their use., Former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley, a Democrat who is exploring a presidential run, has made significant contributions through his leadership PAC, OSay Can You See., Before the November election, his PAC handed out $24,500 in Iowa and New Hampshire to Democratic organizations and federal candidates. The Democratic front-runner, Hillary Rodham Clinton, has not set up a leadership PAC, but a super PAC that is trying to rally support for her has given the maximum of $10,000 each to the Democratic parties in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina., Because it is governed by rules different from those of leadership PACs, Ready for Hillary can receive unlimited donations. It has raised $12.9 million since it formed in 2013., Ready for Hillary and the various leadership PACs also serve another role in these early stages of the race: collecting lists of supporters, which they can then turn over to the campaigns for a price., Corrado, the Colby College professor, said the PACs served as the architecture for a political campaign that, for the nominee, could ultimately cost more than $1 billion., \"It makes for an easy transition when its time to actually get moving and hit the trail daily,\" he said. \"Those lists and established contacts will play heavily when it comes to raising money.\", kurtis.lee@latimes.com, Twitter:@kurtisalee]", "Date": "20150311", "Title": "[Campaign cash: 'Leadership PACs' becoming vehicle of choice for presidential candidates]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-presidential-pacs-2016-20150311-story.html", "Author": "[Kurtis Lee]"}

The firepower scattered the insurgents, clearing the way for the Afghan commandos to break the siege in the eastern province of Ghazni., The U.S.-led coalition officially denies carrying out airstrikes in the battle 125 miles southwest of Kabul, saying international forces provided only aerial surveillance. Under former President Hamid Karzai, coalition airstrikes in populated areas were sharply restricted, although distressed Afghan commanders often requested help anyway., In this case, several Afghan officials and military commanders say, an American air assault ensured that the district did not slip from government control in one of the largest clashes in months in a volatile province connecting Kabul with southern Afghanistan., \"The American helicopters hit two points high on the mountain where the Taliban were firing at us,\" said Gen. Haider Niqpai, commander of the Afghan armys 3rd Brigade, based in Ghazni. \"That was the turning point.\", Even as President Obama prepares to declare an end to U.S. combat in Afghanistan on Dec. 31, the accounts of the battle in Ghazni illustrate how crucial  and politically sensitive  the U.S. role remains in the fight against Taliban-led insurgents., \"In just a few days, our combat mission in Afghanistan will be over,\" Obama said in a Christmas Day address. \"Our longest war will come to a responsible end.\", The U.S. force in Afghanistan will shrink to about 10,800 in January under a pared-down mission focused on training and counter-terrorism. But under combat operations rules that Obama approved last month, U.S. commanders will still be authorized to conduct airstrikes to help Afghan troops who are suffering record casualties in ground skirmishes with a resilient Taliban., Outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said recently that U.S. forces would provide \"limited combat enabler support\" to Afghan troops starting in January., The airstrikes would allow the smaller U.S. force to support their Afghan allies, who have minimal air capability, while exposing Americans to less danger than in ground fighting., But airstrikes also carry the risk of additional civilian casualties, which stoke public anger, keeping the United States deeply enmeshed in a conflict that the White House promised to end., In a farewell visit to Afghanistan in early December, Hagel insisted that Afghan forces had full responsibility for security and that all U.S. troops would withdraw by the end of 2016, as Obama has pledged. The broader U.S. combat policy \"doesnt change any part of what the presidents strategy is,\" Hagel said., U.S. officials had initially signaled that airstrikes under the new mission would be restricted to protecting the remaining coalition forces, including an estimated 3,000 troops from other North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries. But the Afghan government under the new president, Ashraf Ghani, has signaled greater acceptance of American military engagement., Afghan officials in Kabul are careful to say that commanders were ready to fight the Taliban without U.S. air power., \"Its up to the Afghan security forces and the young commanders in the field to demonstrate that leadership,\" said Zubair Massoud, an advisor to Ghanis national security council. \"Its possible for them to do without airstrikes.\", Airstrikes in Afghanistan have declined dramatically over two years as the coalition military presence has shrunk and Afghan forces have taken on most of the fighting. This year through November, U.S. warplanes carried out 2,237 strikes in Afghanistan, half the number from two years earlier, according to statistics from U.S. Air Forces Central Command., But as fighting increased this summer, American forces carried out 437 strikes in August and 441 in September, the most in a two-month span since mid-2012., The strikes are nonetheless of limited use against insurgents waging asymmetrical warfare. Despite nearly 20,000 U.S. missile launches since 2010, according to military statistics, a resurgent Taliban has retaken patches of territory this year that coalition commanders once deemed secure., Afghanistans air force remains a glaring weakness in the 352,000-strong army and police that the United States has spent $57 billion on building since 2002. Beset by low literacy rates, Afghanistan has struggled to train competent pilots. And U.S.-financed helicopters and fixed-wing planes often sit grounded for months because of maintenance problems., The most common helicopter, the Russian-made Mi-17, has been controversial because Afghan pilots have had difficulty flying it and because of allegations of improprieties in the Pentagons purchase of more than $1 billion worth of the aircraft from Moscow., In 2013, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction chided the Pentagon for purchasing an additional 30 Mi-17 helicopters for the Afghan air forces counter-terrorism unit, because \"the Afghans lack the capacity  in both personnel numbers and expertise  to operate and maintain the existing and planned fleets.\", An independent assessment carried out in January for Congress by CNA, a research company, found that the Afghan air forces assault and surveillance capabilities were limited and that \"none of its crews are capable of flying at night.\", Afghan forces do almost all their fighting on the ground, which has meant more casualties. By early November, 4,634 Afghan soldiers and police had been killed in action this year, more than in any previous year, according to coalition statistics; analysts believe that that figure could have been underestimated., The increased ground combat, often in populated areas, is also taking a devastating toll on Afghan civilians. The United Nations reported this month that 2014 has been the deadliest year for Afghan civilians since it began tracking the casualties in 2009, with deaths and injuries expected to top 10,000, a 19% increase from a year ago., \"The lack of air support is a big problem,\" said an Afghan intelligence official in Ghazni, who wasnt authorized to be quoted by name. \"We can identify in certain areas 20 or 30 Taliban. But by the time we get there, theyre gone.\", The late September battle in Ajristan district \"was not pretty,\" the official said. \"Just when we were about to collapse, at the last minute they sent in two foreign helicopters.\", Ajristan  an isolated valley ringed by jagged peaks, more than 10 hours by road from the provincial capital  had seen its main town, Sangar, fall to the Taliban twice in six years. Local officials say insurgents began their latest attack by swarming police outposts on the outskirts of Sangar, killing several officers and taking others hostage while setting fire to homes., \"It was a well-planned attack,\" said Mohammed Ali Ahmadi, deputy governor of Ghazni province. Taliban fighters from multiple provinces joined the assault, part of what Afghan officials say is an effort to establish beachheads in the provinces closest to Kabul., A police contingent set off along the rocky road to Sangar, traveling the last stretch on foot, but the officers were ambushed as they approached. From their mountain bastions, insurgents lighted up homes in Sangar with rocket fire., \"They had us surrounded,\" said police Maj. Ramazan Ali, who participated in the battle., Some local officials were so worried about losing Sangar that they told the news media outlandish stories about Islamic State-inspired attackers beheading civilians and raising black militant flags., Analysts say that could have contributed to the decision to request coalition airstrikes. But police officials credit the Afghan commandos with driving the militants out of Sangar and helping reestablish control of the surrounding villages., \"In the short term, Im happy that we as Afghan forces could stand up for ourselves,\" Ali said. \"But in the long term, I worry about our shortcomings.\"]", "Date": "20141228", "Title": "[U.S. airstrikes remain crucial to Afghan forces in Taliban battles]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/world/afghanistan-pakistan/la-fg-afghanistan-us-military-20141228-story.html", "Author": "[Shashank Bengali]"}
{"Content": "[[, For the last week, the campaign for the Republican presidential nomination has looked like this:, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has gone to the Senate floor to accuse his partys Senate leader of telling \"a flat-out lie.\" Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has accused President Obama of trying to march Israelis \"to the door of the oven\" by agreeing to a nuclear deal with Iran. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has circulated a video showing him taking a chain saw to a stack of tax-code books. And South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham destroyed his cellphone with a baseball bat, also on video., And then theres Donald Trump., If a seeming midsummer madness has taken hold of the campaign, theres a method to it: Next week brings the first debate of the Republican primary season, and only the top 10 candidates, chosen by poll rankings, get to take part. The candidates on the bubble have responded with a frenzied effort to attract attention  stunts, accusations and in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars in advertising., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, Although the efforts may make sense for each candidate, they have created a group picture that may hurt the Republican Partys efforts to portray its candidates as sober, serious potential presidents., Democrats certainly think so, and they have been quick to seize an opening. Obama denounced Huckabees remark from Ethiopias capital, Addis Ababa, on Monday, saying that it reflected a culture of \"outrageous attacks\" tolerated by the GOP., The comparison of the Iran deal to the Holocaust was \"part of a general pattern that would be considered ridiculous if it werent so sad,\" Obama said., \"Weve had a sitting senator call John Kerry Pontius Pilate. Weve had a sitting senator who also happens to be running for president suggest that Im the leading state sponsor of terrorism,\" Obama said, referring to Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Cruz, respectively., \"These are leaders in the Republican Party.\", Candidates always compete for attention, but in this case, a sprawling field of 16 presidential hopefuls, Trumps ability to consume much of the oxygen in the race and the imminence of a poll-driven debate have combined to whip that competition to a frenzy., For the second-tier candidates who are struggling to raise money, the Aug. 6 debate, which is being hosted by Fox News, provides the tantalizing chance of a breakthrough in front of a large television audience of the most-engaged Republican voters., Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich fondly recalls how his debate performances propelled his candidacy in 2012 at a time when his campaign was running on fumes and vastly outspent., \"They were very critical in reaching average voters and reaching people when we had almost no money,\" he said. \"The coverage of the national-media debates, themselves, and the news coverage from the debates sustained us when we were not sustained otherwise.\", The easiest way to raise name identification and potentially gain traction in the polls to qualify for that opportunity is television advertising  much of it on Fox. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and his backers, for example, are spending more than $1 million from late July into early August, $250,000 by his campaign committee and the rest by a \"super PAC\" backing his candidacy., Christie appears confident that he will qualify for the debate. At a town hall in Ankeny, Iowa, on Saturday, when a voter questioned Christies record on gun control, he replied, \"If you want to debate me, run for president, get in the top 10 and come to Fox in Cleveland on Aug. 6, and Id be happy to debate you.\", Under the rules set by Fox, participation in the debate will be determined by aggregating the five most recent national polls released as of Aug. 4. Although pollsters generally wont comment publicly on when theyre conducting surveys, theres a widespread expectation that several national polling groups will conduct polls starting this week to hit that deadline., Given the margin of error of any survey and the way the bottom few candidates have been bunched together in most recent polls, the final few positions in the debate could well be allocated in large part by chance. Foxs rules say that in the event of a tie, it may add an extra chair or two, but it hasnt specified what would constitute a tie. Christie, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, former Hewlett-Packard Chief Executive Carly Fiorina and John Kasich, the two-term Republican governor of Ohio  where the debate will be held  are all among the candidates likely to be competing for the last few slots., Christie is not the only one spending heavily on ads. A super PAC backing Perry is spending $1 million on cable television, conservative talk radio and online ad buys., Perry has also received widespread news coverage for denunciations of Trump, whom he declared to be \"a cancer on conservatism\" that needed to be \"clearly diagnosed, excised and discarded.\" In recent weeks, every time Perry criticized Trump, mentions of him on television, in news articles and on social media spiked, according to an analysis by Zignal Labs, which tracks broadcast, online and social media., Several candidates are turning to cable television interviews to try to raise their profile. Its difficult to turn on Fox News without spotting a presidential hopeful. Santorum, the runner-up for the 2012 nomination, spent a recent day doing five television stints, including an hourlong in-studio appearance on Foxs \"Outnumbered\" and a late-night stop on Rachel Maddows left-leaning show on MSNBC., Candidates who are less likely to make the cut have emphasized that other forums will air, including one on Fox hours before the debate., \"If I was in control of the universe, I would like to be on that stage. I hope very much I will be,\" Fiorina told reporters, referring to the debate, after speaking to Rotarians at a Des Moines country club. \"But I cant control that.\", Many Republican officials also would like to see Fiorina on the debate stage. Shes the sole woman in the race and among the sharpest critics of Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton. But Fiorina, perhaps sensing that shes a long shot to make the cut, downplayed its importance., \"Realistically, were still in the silly season in this presidential election,\" she said. \"The boys are going to fight, and Im just going to keep on talking about the issues, the problems and the solutions.\", For all the agonizing, the debates importance can easily be overstated. Mitt Romney didnt take part in the first debate in the 2012 cycle, yet went on to be the GOP nominee. Next weeks debate is taking place six months before the first voting, while many voters are enjoying the final weeks of summer and paying little attention to the 2016 campaign., \"I know in the chattering class, this is the most important event in the history of mankind, and it will be until the next day, when the next debate will be the most important event,\" said John Weaver, a senior strategist to Kasich. \"We would love to be in it. If were not in it, were not in it. I dont think its going to have any impact on us ultimately winning the nomination.\", Still, the first question a voter posed to Kasich at a town hall in Des Moines on Friday was about how his supporters could help him earn a spot in the debate., Kasich shrugged. \"I dont know what you can do,\" he said., Times staff writer Christi Parsons in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, contributed to this report., ALSO:, Obama on four more years: If I ran, I could win, Carly Fiorina jabs Obama, Clinton in speech at Reagan Presidential Library, Facing unfavorable ratings, Clinton shares personal details to be more relatable]", "Date": "20150728", "Title": "[What's behind the frenzy of stunts, accusations among GOP candidates?

{"Content": "[[, For those of us who predicted the inevitable, watching Donald Trump verbally wander into a field of face-whacking garden rakes like Sideshow Bob fills one with a mixture of schadenfreude and affirmation. We knew it was coming, but it still feels good to be proven right., Of course Trump wouldnt hesitate to attack John McCains war-hero status. Trumps bottomless insecurity cannot countenance the idea that his critics have any legitimacy. Of course Trump wont apologize  because his dog-and-pony show is predicated on the idea that he \"tells it like it is\" and \"fights.\" Hes the omniscient master of \"The Apprentice.\" He cant behave like the Biggest Loser., The Trump squall is not over, alas. But its nonetheless obvious that we will someday soon look back on this as the beginning of the end of Trumpmania., The reason his demise is all so predictable is that personality eventually shines through. A few politicians are capable of hiding their truly unpleasant personal qualities, but it takes enormous effort, and sooner or later the mask slips. In general, what you see is what you get in politics, which is why the most successful politicians have personalities suited for the profession: They are basically likable; they can and want to connect with voters; they can act natural because they are natural politicians., Donald Trump, meanwhile, isnt even a politician. Hes a low-rent carnival barker who made it big on the high-rent circuit. An honest political consultant would put his fees in jeopardy by giving it to him straight: \"For the love of all that is holy, dont be yourself.\", Back in the real campaign, theres an interesting lesson in Trumps ineluctable fate. For months Ive argued that Jeb Bush is the weakest of the top-tier candidates to take on Hillary Rodham Clinton. When you have a competition between two brands, the better brand tends to win. The Clinton brand is simply much more popular than the Bush brand, for reasons we all know., And thats still true. But a brand is also strongest in the abstract. A Clinton may beat a Bush, but voters wont be asked to vote for \"a Clinton,\" theyll be asked to vote for a specific Clinton, namely Hillary. Jebs last name is a problem he can transcend by being himself. Hillarys last name is an asset she damages whenever shes herself., We saw something similar with John F. Kerry in 2004. People liked Kerry in the abstract  military veteran, long-serving senator, etc.  but as a person, not so much. His state poll numbers would often go down when he campaigned and go up when he went on vacation. Clinton is extremely popular when she is an abstraction. The polls show that the more voters see the real person, the less they like her  or trust her., Shes still an obvious favorite for the nomination, but its telling that the Clinton campaign is already trying to lower expectations for the New Hampshire primary and Iowa caucuses, suggesting that Bernie Sanders might win some early bouts., The point is that personality matters a lot, and no won would confuse Clintons personality as a secret weapon. Its been a cliche for three decades for Clintons defenders to say, \"If only you could know the Hillary I know.\" Thats an unintentionally damning defense. It may be true that shes a wonderful friend to her friends, but as a candidate, she is a remarkably uninspiring, un-charming and un-compelling woman who has every bit as much of a problem connecting to ordinary people as Mitt Romney did. Indeed, like Romney, she has polled poorly (June, CNN) on the question of whether she \"cares about people like you.\", In truth, Bush is not a contender for the role of \"the Most Interesting Man in the World\" in those Dos Equis commercials either. But he is showing himself to be a grown-up who is neither easily rattled nor interested in pandering to the crowd. He can get ahead of his family name in a way Clinton clearly cannot. Moreover, nearly all of the other GOP contenders have transparently better retail political skills than Clinton., Donald Trump stakes much of his fortune on the alleged value of the Trump brand. Hillary Clintons candidacy rests on a similar assumption about the Clinton name. Both fail to take into account the fact that personality trumps brand., jgoldberg@latimescolumnists.com, Follow the Opinion section on Twitter@latimesopinion and Facebook]", "Date": "20150721", "Title": "[The Trump lesson that Bush and Clinton should heed]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-goldberg-personality-trumps-brand-in-politics-20150721-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, For years, President Obama had a singular problem: convincing Americans who were not feeling the economic recovery that it was real and a cause for optimism, not to mention for electing fellow Democrats., Now Republicans seeking to capture the White House find themselves on the brink of the reverse dilemma: how to dismiss the economic revival that many Americans seem finally to be embracing., For the party out of power, better economic times always pose strategic difficulties. In 2016, Republicans must argue that Democrats have so fumbled their handling of the nations economy  the No. 1 issue for voters  that they should be booted from power. But that requires a huge dose of pessimism that runs the risk of making Republicans seem out of touch with the nations increasingly upbeat mood., As top Republican White House prospects gathered this weekend for a forum in Des Moines, they seemed to have come to a temporary solution: talk about foreign policy, or immigration, or the power of a mothers love  anything but a deep dive into the issue that has overarched the last two presidential campaigns., New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum made brief stabs at the discomfort that persists beneath the budding optimism, particularly among financially stressed Americans. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee dismissed the improving jobless numbers as ephemeral and blamed Obamas healthcare measure for forcing full-time workers into part-time jobs. But there was little on the order of solutions, other than the Republican standbys of shrinking the size and sway of government and lowering taxes., Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who skipped the Iowa event, framed what probably will be the GOP argument if the economy stays as it is through the November 2016 election., \"Sixty percent of Americans believe that were still in a recession,\" Bush said in part of a broader critique of Obamas tenure during a Friday speech in San Francisco. \"Theyre not dumb. Its because they are in a recession. Theyre frustrated, and they see a small portion of the population on the economys up escalator. Portfolios are strong, but paychecks are weak. Millions of Americans want to move forward in their lives, they want to rise, but theyre losing hope.\", That approach is complicated: Republicans are seen by many voters, particularly those who turn out in greater numbers in presidential cycles, as the party of the people with portfolios, so arguing the underclass case requires an image adjustment. And the argument could lose potency if the economy continues to improve in the 22 months before presidential ballots are cast., The recovery could also fall apart, but in recent months Americans seem less inclined to expect so. A Gallup poll last week found 41% of Americans satisfied with the economy; a year earlier the figure was 28%. Consumer confidence is riding higher than it has since the 2008 economic collapse. The percentage of people who believe the country is on the right track has risen sharply. Obamas approval ratings likewise are higher, offering a potential leg up for his partys chosen successor., There are two precedents, with different outcomes, for how economic recovery can play out as a party seeks the historically rare third successive term, as Democrats will in 2016. Both involved candidates named Bush., In 1988, as vice president, George H.W. Bush argued that the countrys fiscal position at the end of the Reagan administration should persuade voters to side with him over Democrat Michael Dukakis., As Bush argued when he accepted the Republican nomination, \"When you have to change horses in midstream, doesnt it make sense to switch to the one whos going the same way?\", Twelve years later, Bushs son  and Jeb Bushs brother  George W. Bush faced a similar set of circumstances from the opposite side, challenging Vice President Al Gore during a time of economic prosperity and general optimism. Bush won, exploiting fatigue over the personal escapades of President Clinton and adopting a wildly optimistic tone himself., \"We will use these good times for great goals,\" he said in his first convention speech. \"And we will extend the promise of prosperity to every forgotten corner of this country.\", That tone has largely been missing from the Republican conversation so far, in part because anger is a far better propellant for the party out of power. David Bossie of the Citizens United political group, which cosponsored the Iowa event, was practically apocalyptic onstage, declaring that \"our country is mired in darkness.\", Christie and Santorum took different approaches when they spoke., In a manner reminiscent of Jeb Bush, the New Jersey governor outlined the \"anxiety\" he said he found in voters before the 2014 midterm election, which he blamed on income stagnation. No proposals for solving it were forthcoming, and Christie then moved to a long discourse about his antiabortion position and his relationship with his mother  an extended anecdote meant to assure Iowans that he would always tell them the truth., Santorum took more aggressive aim  at his own party., \"You want to show that were relating to folks who are working in America? Then we have to go out and prove it,\" said Santorum, who has positioned himself as the partys blue-collar champion. He noted that the party had allied itself with business owners, rather than the far larger pool of employees., \"We dont win because too many people dont think we care about them,\" he said. \"Weve got to show them  not just by saying we do but by having policies and a message where they can see it and they can feel it in us.\", Craig Robinson, a former Iowa Republican Party operative and founder of the Iowa Republican political website, said that so far none of the candidates appeared to have hit on a solution for how to manage optimism., \"The Republicans need to start talking about it as: Imagine what the economy would be if we did X, Y and Z,\" he said. \"They need to make the argument that it could be even better.\", cathleen.decker@latimes.com, Twitter: @cathleendecker, Times staff writer Mark Z.

{"Content": "[[, Foreign policy is traditionally not a hot topic for presidential primary candidates this early in the game, so I was surprised to receive a request recently to talk about Russia from one of the often-mentioned candidates. But, of course, it is not too early. The United States no longer has the luxury of ignoring Russia. For the first time since the mid-1980s, it has become one of the most pressing national security concerns, and presidential contenders will be asked what they plan to do about it., So what  in the traditional \"two-pages-or-less\" campaign format  should a putative candidate know?, First and most important: The Russia the next U.S. president will have to engage with for four or eight years will be Vladimir Putins Russia. Having just turned 62, Putin, his periodic denials notwithstanding, is well on his way to a presidency-for-life, with or without elections. Reportedly swimming two hours in the morning, lifting weights, playing hockey, Putin is fit and trim. His personal control over Russia is the most complete by any leader since Josef Stalin., What, then, does Putin want? What is his overarching agenda? What does he aspire to for his country and himself  the two undoubtedly merged inexorably in his mind? What makes Putin tick?, The ultimate goal, which has motivated and guided him since he took over the presidency 14 years ago and which he has pursued with remarkable consistency and persistence, is to recover most, if not all, key assets  political, economic and geostrategic  lost in the collapse of the Soviet state. I call this overarching agenda the Putin Doctrine., Translated into policies, it has meant a gradual but relentless restoration of the states control, or outright ownership, of national politics, the courts, the media and, most important, national television channels. It also includes most institutions of civil society. In economic terms, the doctrine dictates the re-occupation and control of what Vladimir Lenin called the \"commanding heights of the economy,\" particularly the oil and gas industry., Outside the country, the Putin Doctrine aims at Moscows de facto veto power over domestic regimes and foreign and defense orientations of most post-Soviet states, with swift and unyielding pressure applied to those that attempt to resist. Globally, the doctrine has guided Putins efforts to restore Russia to the status of a great power  defined in the quasi-Soviet way seen in much of Putins thinking  mostly in opposition to the United States. Finally, his Russia must continue as the worlds other nuclear superpower, which, in Putins mind, is incompatible with any kind of European strategic missile defense., Putin has been very successful in all of these objectives, and there is no doubt that he will stick with them. These are the cornerstones, the starting points, of any future U.S.-Russia bilateral agenda that the next American president will have to engage with., Does this mean that the U.S. president cannot modify Putins goals? Of course not., Although unflinching in his convictions and ultimate objectives, Putin is not a great strategist. He is instead a clever tactician. His sport and passion is judo, where you win by watching your opponent like a hawk, probing for a weakness in order to catch your adversary off balance  then going for it at lightning speed with all you have., Although he is dangerous, and could be lethal, Putin is not invincible. He is stubborn but not mad. His mind and his policies can be changed  not by sweet talk or by shaming him as a 19th century throwback, but rather by a White House that is firm and consistent, but also open-minded, alert and flexible., The most effective model might be the way President Reagan handled the Soviet Union: a combination of patience and resolution, but also flexibility and attention to any potential opening for cooperation that would genuinely advance U.S. national interests. Most of all, the next American president should be guided by Reagans unshakable conviction that the only way to fundamentally change Russias policies is to create an inducement for domestic reforms. And that can be done only by increasing the cost of domestic repression and foreign aggression., Under Reagan, this approach resulted in an unprecedented elimination of an entire class of dangerous nuclear weapons (medium range missiles), laying the groundwork for equally unparalleled conventional and strategic nuclear cuts, and the 1988 Moscow summit that profoundly altered the tenor of U.S.-Russia bilateral relations for almost two decades ., It will be neither easy nor quick. But as with the Soviet Union, time is on the side of reform  that is, on the side of the Russian people. Oil, the lifeblood of the Russian economy, is below $80 a barrel, which means that Russia is almost certain to slip into a recession. Capital flight out of the country will probably reach a record $100 billion to $150 billion this year. The ruble is at a historic low against the dollar and the euro, and inflation will probably be 8% for the year. As of September, the price for staples, such as chicken and pork, is up 19% or more compared with January., The Kremlin is no longer capable of securing both guns and butter. The billion-dollar price tags for Crimea, Putins pet new state of \"Novorossiya,\" and a mammoth military modernization are coming due, not to mention the costs from Western sanctions. Russian cannot deal with these expenses without slashing budgets for healthcare and education, freezing pensions and salaries; that is, he cant deal with them without hitting his political base by reducing the incomes of tens of millions of pensioners and state employees., The choice grows starker by the day: Go for deep institutional, decentralizing and liberalizing reforms that drastically improve the investment climate? Or, opt for the re-Stalinization of Russia in a reign of mass impoverishment and repression, inevitably leading to a collapse., Leon Aron is a resident scholar and director of Russian studies at the American Enterprise Institute., Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion]", "Date": "20141203", "Title": "[ What makes Putin tick?

Bobby Jindal, former HP executive Carly Fiorina, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush participated in a series of 45-minute chats with Brown., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, They touched on the usual hot-button issues in education: teacher tenure (mostly against it), the Common Core (they disagreed), charter schools (highly supportive) and teachers unions (their influence should be tempered.), Despite this initial blip of high-profile publicity, though, proponents of making 2016 an ed-lection, so to speak, have a long road ahead of them., Whose schools?, Schools in the United States are run by local school boards or mayors, several layers removed from the federal government and the politicians who vie to run it  only 8% of school funding comes from Washington, D.C. American parents are deeply connected with their own schools, but have less of a tie to the national education system as a whole, an interest that could translate into presidential voting preferences., This dissonance can be seen in parents attitudes toward different sets of schools. Fifty-five percent of parents said they would give their neighborhood public schools an A or B rating, whereas 28% of parents said they would give Americas public schools the same top grades, according to a recent poll from Education Next., If people like their local schools, regardless of what they think about schools nationally, theyre not going to be very likely to vote based on that issue, says Matt Chingos, a senior fellow at the UrbanInstitute. Theyre not going to vote for someone just because that candidate is going to fix a problem with someone elses schools., Parents can more likely relate to issues around higher education, such as student debt and the regulation of for-profit colleges -- its more personal, and more clearly influenced by the federal government. Former Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton took note of this, and last week released a campaign proposal on college affordability., Additionally, it takes time for changes to education systems to have real, measurable effects on student performance. The shelf life of a politician and his and her whims is often much shorter than this lag, a fact that results in instability both at the national policy level and within school districts. , The Obama administration, for example, has tried to remedy the faults of the punitive No Child Left Behind Act by allowing states to get out from under its most stringent requirements by issuing waiversthat trade in the laws strings for a states buy-in to certain preferred reforms, such as tying teachers evaluations partially tostudent test scores., Now, Congress is trying to reconcile two very different billsthat would update the law, but if that doesnt happen, those waivers can be pulled as soon as the next president steps into office. So a parent might not look to the presidential election and wonder how the candidates might affect their own childs education in the long term., A Debbie Downer issue?, Jack Jennings has seen so-called education candidates come and go, during the almost 30 years he spent as the House Education Committees general counsel. He observed that previous presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush were able to tap into voters hopes by running on platforms heavy with education policy., But the trajectory of education law since then has made it harder to do, because the federal governments role became punitive with the passage of Bushs No Child Left Behind Act, Jennings said. No Child Left Behind tied federal funding for schools with regular standardized testing, and has an escalating set of fixes for schools that are deemed to be failing by those metrics. That switch, Jennings says, makes it harder to run on education like Clinton or Bush did. Obama has kept many of No Child Left Behinds stringencies., Because of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, education has changed from being a positive national issue to being a negative national issue, Jennings said. All Congress is doing, theyre revising a bill that is removing requirements from Bushs law and restraining the education secretary from taking action. Theres no positive vision in Congress or in politics about what education can do.\", Hillary Rodham Clinton, Jennings noted, probably chose to focus on higher education last week for that reason. Teachers are tired, and they dont see anything positive coming from the federal level that is going to support them, he said., And even if the issues might sound negative, Chingos added that education tends to be an issue of major bipartisan agreement, something that might prevent it from rising to the level of a presidential campaign. Weve seen some attention from the Republican side on Common Core, because the candidates dont agree, but more generally, theres less disagreement between the political parties on K-12 education than there used to be, Chingos said. , Past problem, People have tried to do this before. In 2008, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Eli & Edythe Broad Foundation sponsored the $25 million Ed in 08 campaign to elevate education in the 2008 presidential election. They picked former Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, a Democrat, to run the effort. But it didnt quite work., A recent case studyfrom the conservative think tank the American Enterprise Institute found that nominees werent too receptive to Ed in 08s overtures, and that it was difficult to get education questions asked at debates. A few years after the campaign ended, the paper notes, its website was shut down, and by July 2009 it was as if Ed in 08 had never existed., Brown herself conceded that the history of attempts to get people to vote on national education isnt on her side. \"Education should have been a huge part of the conversation in the last several presidential elections,\" Brown said in an interview. \"Last cycle you had Obama and Romney who agreed on a lot of stuff, so it wasnt controversial enough to rise to the level to be a part of the debate.\", Even the American Enterprise Institute paper noted that while Ed in 08 failed, it laid the groundwork for future education campaigns. And Brown thinks this time will be different. This cycle, theres a lot happening that puts it front and center, she said. This election has the potential to be much more about education than previous ones, because you have candidates who understand the influence it has., FOR THE RECORD:An earlier version of this article stated that Chingos works at the Manhattan Institute.

{"Content": "[[, Former Democratic Assemblyman Isadore Hall III of Compton on Tuesday won a special election for the state Senate, beating three other candidates for a Los Angeles County seat left vacant by the resignation of Sen. Roderick Wright., With all precincts reporting, Hall had 54.98% of the vote, enough to avoid a Feb. 10 runoff election. He beat Democrats Louis L. Dominguez of San Pedro and Hector Serrano of Wilmington, and Republican James Spencer of Inglewood., Spencer finished a distant second., \"I am deeply humbled and sincerely thankful for the confidence placed in me by the voters of the 35th district,\" Hall said in declaring victory. \"I take great pride in this sacred responsibility, and in being the voice of so many people and so many local neighborhoods in our state capital.\", The seat was left vacant in October when Wright resigned after a jury convicted him of felony voter fraud and perjury for lying about living in his Senate district., Hall spent $478,000 on the campaign and had endorsements from the California Democratic Party and Gov.

Bush and son of former President George H.W. Bush, has said hes been weighing a run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016., Tuesdays announcement, which was also published by the 61-year-old Bush on Twitter, comes a day after he spoke at the commencement ceremony for the University of South Carolina -- located in an early presidential primary state., Bush has made a host of other moves to make a potential candidacy more visible, such as a television interview last weekend in which he announced that he planned to write an e-book on his governorship. He also recently announced that he would release 250,000 emails from his tenure as Floridas chief executive., Although the establishment GOP considers Bush a top-tier candidate, he has drawn ire from others in the party for supporting comprehensive immigration reform and Common Core, the national education standards for K-12 students that are being implemented in dozens of states. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who has also expressed interest in a presidential run, is another favorite of establishment Republicans., Throughout the 2014 election cycle, Bush headlined fundraisers for Republicans and made several campaign appearances., Earlier this month, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, a close Bush ally, announced that he would not run for president., Bushs announcement prompted an immediate response from Democrats: This what hes been doing all along?

{"Content": "[[, Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush defended his credentials as a reform-minded conservative Friday, even as he held firm to positions that threaten to undermine his standing with party activists, telling skeptics that he hoped to be their second choice to win the GOP presidential nomination., Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual proving ground for Republican candidates, the establishment favorite came with practiced quick answers and light quips for a 20-minute question-and-answer period with Fox News host Sean Hannity. He acknowledged his audiences suspicions, and laid out, gently, a case for broadening the partys appeal., There are a lot of other conservatives that havent been asked. They dont know that theyre conservative, Bush said. If we share our enthusiasm, love for our country and believe in our philosophy, we will be able to get Latinos and young people and other people that we need to win., Bushs appearance was his first before a large, conservative crowd since he began his still-undeclared quest for the 2016 nomination and was a showcase of whats to come if he hopes to win over primary voters. His top competitors for the nomination, including Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, also addressed the group this week, each test-driving speeches and banter aimed at winning over, or at least quieting, some of the partys most ardent troops., For Bush, the challenge involved touting his conservative credentials, while holding firm to positions that are problematic for many core Republican conservatives, such as supporting immigration reform and the Common Core education standards., On immigration, he reiterated his support for some kind of path to legal status for those who have come to the U.S. illegally, saying there is no plan to deport 11 million people., We should give them a path to legal status where they work, where they dont receive government benefits, where they learn English and they make a contribution to our society, he said., But Bush also said he opposed President Obamas recent executive action that would shield up to 5 million immigrants from deportation. He supported a congressional effort to try to block the policy, he said, but not if doing so risked funds for the Department of Homeland Security, a strategy pursued by some congressional Republicans., Im not an expert on the ways of Washington. It makes no sense to me that were not funding control of our border, which is the whole argument, he said., He stood by his support for granting drivers licenses and in-state tuition to some immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. He also talked about the Common Core, saying he supported the idea of set standards, but suggested he was aligned with conservatives on his opposition to federal government involvement. The Obama administration, Bush said, has meddled in the process with its Race to the Top program that ties school money to achievement on standardized tests., Not all potential candidates had to approach the crowd on the defensive. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who spoke Thursday, was clearly a favorite, thanks to his confrontations with public employee unions and his survival of a recall election. Walkers speech received thunderous applause., We won in Wisconsin, a state that hasnt gone Republican for president since 1984, he said. We did it without compromising. We stood up and said what we were going to do, and we did it., The otherwise polished Walker stumbled, though, when he discussed whether voters should be concerned about his lack of foreign policy experience: He said his fights with labor unions equipped him to fight Islamic State militants. , If I can take on 100,000 protesters, I can do the same across the globe, he said, causing even some supporters to wince., Paul, the junior senator from Kentucky, was another welcome face at the gathering. He also tried to defend his foreign policy vision, making clear he takes a more nuanced view than his famously noninterventionist father, former Rep. Ron Paul of Texas., In his speech Friday, Paul was grounded in libertarian principles but argued for a more traditional Republican line on defense. His views  unparalleled, undefeatable and unencumbered by nation-building  are an extension of President Reagans advocacy of peace through strength, Paul said, during remarks often interrupted by chants of President Paul!, The conference also included the outer rings of the partys reach. , Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson delivered a meandering speech that offered advice on legislative decorum and sexually transmitted diseases. Donald Trump offered a recent real estate deal with the federal government as proof that he has the mettle to lead the nation., Still, organizers said this years gathering was focused on trying to test the politicians likely to win the partys nod next year. Rather than just allow would-be candidates to deliver a red-meat speech, the group has required them to follow their opening remarks with a question-and-answer session. Conservative media figures including Hannity and Laura Ingraham have led the questioning., Hannity peppered Rubio with questions about the politically difficult parts of his record, particularly immigration. Rubios support for a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013 was extremely unpopular with many conservatives. The senator said the lesson he had learned in the two years since helping to write that legislation was that you cant discuss pathways to citizenship until Americans believe that future illegal immigration will be controlled., Bush, too, was asked rapid-fire questions with thorny implications. He denied reports that he may be shifting his opposition to same-sex marriage as he courts gay donors, saying, No, I believe in traditional marriage. And he won cheers by declaring he opposes legalizing marijuana but believes states ought to have that right to do it., Hannity mentioned how, when he had said Bushs name in an earlier speech, many in the audience booed, and so offered the former governor a chance to defend his record., For those that made a ooo sound  is that what that was?  Im marking them down as neutral, and I want to be your second choice, Bush said., , michael.memoli@latimes.com, kathleen.hennessey@latimes.com, Times staff writer Evan Halper contributed to this report., , 7:48 p.m.: This story was updated throughout., 12:54 p.m.: This story was updated with quotes from former Gov.

{"Content": "[[, Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush outlined his plan to fix the nations immigration system: Secure the borders, change the mix of immigrants who are allowed to enter the country, and finally, create a path to legalization for those in the country illegally., \"This is the only serious, thoughtful way of dealing with this, and we better start doing it,\" Bush told an audience at an agriculture gathering on Saturday., Hundreds of Iowa Republicans sat stone-faced in response., Bushs two-day trip to Iowa this weekend  his first foray to the state since he announced his interest in the 2016 presidential race  featured warm receptions from voters intrigued by his familiar connections and his record., It also provided hints of problems he could face in the state that will open presidential nominating next winter, particularly on a trio of issues  immigration, his support for federal education standards and his support for phasing out a renewable-fuels mandate responsible for an economic boom in Iowa., The son of one president and the brother of another, Bush is viewed as a national front-runner for the GOP nomination based on his fundraising prowess and name identification. And over two days in Iowa, Bush spared no effort to convince residents that he loves their state. But the unanswered question is whether they will love him back., \"He has a lot of work to do here, and hes got to start from scratch. He has to build relationships, and build a lot of them pretty quickly,\" said Craig Robinson, a former party official and founder of the Iowa Republican website. \"He might be the front-runner, but he may be the most vulnerable front-runner Ive seen.\", In what served as an unofficial campaign kickoff Friday and Saturday, Bush raised money for a congressman in Urbandale, addressed the agricultural forum along with several other potential candidates, met with supporters at a Waukee barbecue joint and greeted diners at a Pizza Ranch in Cedar Rapids., Iowa has been a boon and a bane to Bushs family. His father, former President George H. W. Bush, notched a surprise win in the states caucuses over Ronald Reagan in 1980, which positioned him to be Reagans running mate. But he dropped to an ignominious third place in 1988, though he eventually won the White House. Jeb Bushs brother, former President George W. Bush, won the caucuses twice, in 2000 and 2004., Jeb Bush fondly recalled stumping across Iowa on behalf of his father., \"Ive done it both ways,\" he told about 100 audience members (and 50 reporters) at the fundraiser. \"Ive been to Iowa where my dad lost, and Ive been there when he won. I like the winning part better, to be honest with you.\", Both father and brother had some deeply loyal supporters in the state., \"I was a super volunteer for his brother,\" said Megan Hippensteel, 39, who saw Bush speak Saturday in Cedar Rapids. \"I am Jeb Bush all the way.\", But those ties do not always transfer to the third Bush., \"The Bush name gives you entree, but it doesnt make the sale,\" said Doug Gross, a prominent GOP attorney who served as a finance chair for Bushs brother and is unaligned this cycle., He added that the last time any Bush ran a competitive race here was 2000, so any network long ago dispersed., \"We live long in Iowa, but eventually we do die,\" he said., Jeb Bushs effort is further complicated by the rightward move of the states Republicans since the last Bush campaign. A new dominance by conservative churchgoers in particular propelled former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to their respective victories here in 2012 and 2008., Those voters are deeply skeptical of two issues in which Bush holds views contrary to theirs: his support for a pathway to legality for immigrants in the country illegally and his endorsement of the Common Core education standards., Popular conservative talk-radio host Steve Deace described those two matters as \"nonnegotiables.\", \"Those are sun-hot issues,\" he said during a commercial break at his West Des Moines studio. \"Well find out what percentage of Republicans really are in favor of open borders and having schools dictated to from elites on high. I dont suspect those numbers are very high.\", Tellingly, the first question Bush received from an Iowan in a public forum was about Common Core., Bush affirmed his support of it without using the words \"Common Core,\" and emphasized that he believes education decisions should be made at the state and local levels., \"Raising expectations and having accurate assessments of where kids are  it is tantamount, it is essential for success,\" Bush told the audience member in Urbandale. But \"the federal government shouldnt have a role influencing  directly or indirectly  standards or curriculum or content.\", Voters who were skeptical of Bushs positions on immigration and education said they were willing to listen to his rationale in the coming months., \"Im watching and observing,\" said attorney Eric Turner, 59, of Des Moines, who heard Bush at the fundraiser. \"I am here to learn and listen and decide later on.\", Gov. Terry Branstad, a fellow Republican, said he told Bush that a key to success would be replicating his fathers 1980 strategy. While Reagan held a handful of public events, the elder Bush, wife Barbara and three of their sons, including Jeb Bush, fanned out to Iowas 99 counties., \"I reminded Jeb Bush that he knows how to win Iowa because he saw what his father did here,\" Branstad said in an interview at the gold-domed Capitol. Branstad does the full tour every year, and he won 98 counties in his 2014 reelection. \"To win Iowa, youve got to go everywhere.\", Bush told reporters that he recognized he needed to differentiate himself from the 41st and 43rd presidents., \"There are people, including myself, that love my brother, love my dad,\" he said. \"But Im going to have to get this on my own.\", seema.mehta@latimes.com, Twitter: @latseema]", "Date": "20150308", "Title": "[Jeb Bush's Iowa visit hints at hurdles he could face in key state]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-jeb-bush-iowa-20150308-story.html", "Author": "[Seema Mehta]"}
{"Content": "[[, Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa announced Tuesday that he would not enter the race for Barbara Boxers seat in the U.S. Senate, leaving state Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris as the only major candidate., \"I am humbled by the encouragement Ive received from so many to serve in the United States Senate,\" Villaraigosa said in a written statement. \"But as I think about how best to serve the people of this great state, I know that my heart and my family are here in California, not Washington, D.C.\", Villaraigosas surprise decision followed weeks of meetings and phone conversations with Democratic luminaries, campaign consultants, fundraisers and potential supporters. Close allies had expected him to run., The June 2016 Senate primary would have been Villaraigosas first tough campaign since he unseated Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn in 2005. Win or lose, it would have put Villaraigosa back in the public spotlight after 19 months of keeping a low profile in the private sector., When he left office, Villaraigosa, a Democrat, told reporters he wanted to run for governor in 2018. But Boxers announcement in early January that she would not seek reelection provided an opening for a quicker return to public office, albeit as one of 100 senators in Washington., Some Villaraigosa advisors suggested he had a better shot at the Senate in 2016 than at governor in 2018., Voter turnout in Los Angeles County -- a crucial source of support for Villaraigosa -- can be dismal in years when theres no presidential contest on the ballot, so the relatively high turnout expected in 2016 made a Senate campaign particularly appealing., By 2018, it will have been five years since Villaraigosa held elected office, so his reentry into elective politics after such a long absence from regular news coverage could prove challenging., Villaraigosa, 62, hinted in his statement that a run for governor was still possible., \"I have decided not to run for the U.S. Senate and instead continue my efforts to make California a better place to live, work and raise a family,\" he said. \"We have come a long way, but our work is not done, and neither am I.\", Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a former San Francisco mayor, has already opened a committee to start raising money for the 2018 governors race., In the Senate contest, Harris is the only major candidate, at least for now. Candidates have more than a year to file papers declaring they are running., For weeks, Harris supporters have tried to clear the field of potential competitors. Former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, who was romantically involved with Harris in the 1990s, told the Sacramento Bee that Villaraigosa should forgo the Senate race in deference to the attorney general., Villaraigosa allies suggested Democratic leaders in San Francisco were trying to anoint one of their own at the expense of Southern California Latinos. Harris is a former San Francisco district attorney., Villaraigosa, the first Latino mayor of modern Los Angeles, has 16 years of experience in elected office. He represented Los Angeles in the Assembly from 1994 to 2000, including two years as speaker, one of state governments most powerful positions., In 2001, he ran for mayor but lost to Hahn after a brutal campaign. Hahn attacked Villaraigosa for writing a letter to the Clinton White House on behalf of a convicted drug trafficker., After his defeat, Villaraigosa sought a platform to launch another campaign for mayor: He won an Eastside seat on the City Council in 2003. In his rematch with Hahn two years later, Villaraigosa benefited from the collapse of Hahns coalition of black voters in South Los Angeles and white voters in the San Fernando Valley., Twitter: @finneganLAT]", "Date": "20150224", "Title": "[Former L.A.

{"Content": "[[, Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa emerged as the most formidable potential rival of state Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris for Barbara Boxers Senate seat Thursday after billionaire Tom Steyer announced that he would not run., Steyer, a former hedge fund manager who gave $74 million last year to candidates who vowed to fight global warming, said he thought he could do more as a private citizen than as a senator to promote justice in education, the economy and the environment., \"This was a very hard decision,\" he wrote on the Huffington Post website. \"The U.S. Senate offers a unique opportunity to serve, but I also know that we will have excellent candidates.\", After Boxers announcement two weeks ago that she would not seek reelection, Steyer said he was seriously considering a run  a daunting prospect for opponents who could not match the personal fortune at his disposal for advertising., For now, Harris, 50, remains the lone major candidate in the June 2016 primary. But Villaraigosa, who turns 62 on Friday, has spent two weeks seeking advice and trying to build support in private meetings and phone conversations with elected officials, party luminaries, fundraisers and campaign consultants., He joked about the race Thursday at an awards dinner in Washington., \"I have an important announcement to make,\" he told the crowd, pausing. \"Dessert will be served in a moment.\", Villaraigosa could still opt to run instead for governor in 2018  or give up hope of returning to elected office. But if he enters the Senate race, as associates expect he will, Villaraigosas maiden run for statewide office could be tough., His candidacy would set up a political clash between Los Angeles and San Francisco, where fellow Democrat Harris was district attorney from 2004 to 2010. A key question is whether he could mobilize broad enough support in Southern California to offset Harris strength in the Bay Area, a bastion of liberal Democrats., He would need to inspire heavy turnout of Latinos, as he did in his mayoral campaigns. Turnout can be dismal in the Los Angeles area, but its normally highest in a presidential election, increasing the allure of a 2016 race., Villaraigosas 2005 election as the first Latino mayor of modern Los Angeles symbolized the ascendancy of Latinos as a major political force in California. If he captured Boxers seat, Villaraigosa would be Californias first Latino in the Senate., Some of Villaraigosas Latino allies in L.A. have suggested that Harris was anointed by the San Francisco Democrats who have long dominated the party in California. Fabian Nuez, like Villaraigosa a former state Assembly speaker, described her as part of an entrenched Bay Area \"machine\" that included Boxer, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and state party Chairman John Burton., Boxer and Feinstein have been a \"very strong collective political force\" for the Bay Area since they won their Senate seats 22 years ago, Nuez said, but Latinos now make up a much larger share of the California vote., \"The dynamics have changed since 1992,\" said Nuez, who named Villaraigosa and Reps. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles) and Loretta Sanchez (D-Garden Grove) as viable contenders in a race against Harris. \"We have a role to play.\", Becerra and Sanchez are still weighing whether to run for Senate., For Villaraigosa, Steyers exit Thursday was a mixed blessing. The San Francisco billionaire could have eroded Harris Bay Areasupport. But with his money, Steyer also could have blocked Villaraigosa from advancing to the November runoff., Villaraigosa said he called Steyer as soon as he heard of his decision. \"I have a lot of respect for him,\" Villaraigosa said., A key task for Villaraigosa would be image rebuilding. His turbulent personal life  his marriage ended after an affair with a local TV newscaster  harmed his public standing while he was mayor., And his frequent travels, which raised his national profile, set off grumbling at City Hall that he was more focused on personal ambition than the day-to-day job of running the city., Still, Villaraigosas record as mayor would probably serve as the foundation for his campaign., During his tenure, he secured billions of dollars in public transit money, much of it for rail-line expansion, and the city made a big shift from coal-fired power plants to solar and wind energy. His plan to win mayoral control of the L.A. Unified School District failed, but Villaraigosa used his clout to influence its leadership and oversee a small group of low-performing schools that made academic gains., His schools agenda turned powerful teacher unions against him, which could pose serious trouble in a Senate race., Since leaving office, Villaraigosa has worked as an advisor to nutritional products company Herbalife Ltd., the Banc of California and the global public relations firm Edelman. He has also been a part-time professor at the USC Price School of Public Policy., The Herbalife job could be another liability. Brent Wilkes, national executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens, a civil rights group, has criticized Villaraigosa for advising the company, which has battled allegations that it runs an illegal pyramid scheme and preys on Latino entrepreneurs., Villaraigosa has defended Herbalife, saying it was \"a solid member of the Los Angeles business community and a strong presence within the Latino community.\", Another uncertainty is who else might get into the race. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Burbank) said Thursday that he was seriously considering it. Among the House members weighing whether to run, Schiff is one of the strongest fundraisers, with more than $2.1 million in the bank, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks campaign money., But it is unclear how he could frame a candidacy with enough statewide appeal to compete with Harris, who hopes to run especially strongly among women, or Villaraigosa.

I think both parties kind of are married to their constituencies and their powerful interests, and theyre unwilling to challenge them in the way I did as mayor., Villaraigosa, who as mayor clashed with teachers unions, did not elaborate on what he meant by stuck in last year., But the context  answering an audience members question on the 2016 presidential race  suggested his focus was more on Clinton than on President Obama or Congress. Villaraigosa campaigned extensively for Clinton in her losing battle for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination., Ultimately, he suggested, Clinton will prevail, even if she endures a lot of noise in a contested race for the party nomination. Democrats who might brave the long odds and challenge Clinton include former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley and former Sen.

{"Content": "[[, Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney announced Friday that he will not run for president in 2016, catching even some of his closest supporters by surprise and scrambling the race for the Republican Party nomination., Two weeks after he publicly announced his interest in a third run at the White House, Romney told donors, former staffers and other supporters in a conference call that he believed he had the fundraising and political base to win the nomination, and cited positive recent polls. But he conceded that it would be a tough fight, and said that one of the next generation of GOP leaders could be more capable of defeating the Democratic nominee in 2016., After putting considerable thought into making another run for president, Ive decided it is best to give other leaders in the party the opportunity to become our next nominee, said Romney., I feel that it is critical that America elect a conservative leader to become our next president. You know that I have wanted to be that president, he said. But I do not want to make it more difficult for someone else to emerge who may have a better chance of becoming that president., There was an air of passing the torch in Romneys departure, which opens up the race for the nomination to more establishment-oriented candidates such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie., More conservative contenders, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, have also been positioning themselves, as have lesser-known figures such as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker., I believe that one of our next generation of Republican leaders, one who may not be as well-known as I am today, one who has not yet taken their message across the country, one who is just getting started, may well emerge as being better able to defeat the Democrat nominee, Romney said. In fact, I expect and hope that to be the case., Romneys comments about generational change seemed to imply that Jeb Bush might not be the best choice for the GOP. The son of one president and the brother of another, Jeb Bush is the candidate carrying the weight of a dynasty in his race for the GOP nomination., After Romney told donors that he was thinking about mounting a third presidential bid, he really spent time studying whether to do it, said one longtime close advisor who had urged him to run again., Thats what hes been doing the last three weeks  making a lot of phone calls to people he respects and admires. Not only people in the campaign  grass-roots leaders, trying to take everyones sense of this thing., Romney and his wife, Ann, decided over the weekend not to mount a campaign, but delayed an announcement to see how comfortable they were with that decision, the advisor said., Mitt said both he and Ann struggled with the decision. It was not an easy decision. It was a hard decision. I think thats simply because he would have started off with some obvious advantages and he was passing this opportunity to other leaders in the party. Thats hard to do. As I said, he has a strong sense of duty and obligation to his party and thats what ultimately prevailed, the advisor said., Recently, some of Romneys donors and campaign staffers had begun to make public their commitments to other candidates, but insiders minimized the impact of those changes on the current campaign., Among Romney staffers, including those who questioned the wisdom of a third run, there was a palpable sadness, a feeling that maybe a chapter is over, one source said., Even for people who felt like it wasnt the right thing or felt like it wouldnt be in his interest or in the interest of the party, its bittersweet., Rich Beeson, Romney 2012 political director, said the senior staff would have been solidly behind Romney had he chosen to run., While others expressed sadness, Beeson said there was also a sense of relief that Romney and his wife and family would not go through the grueling process of another presidential campaign., There is such a sense of respect and admiration for him and Ann. As much as people might have wanted to do another campaign, the thought of them not getting dragged through it again  theres a little bit of a sense of relief, Beeson said., Craig Robinson, a former Iowa GOP official and founder of the influential Iowa Republican website, said he was completely surprised, in part because Romney had been making moves in that state indicating he was serious about a third run. He said Romneys decision dramatically changes the race in Iowa and in other early states, by easing the path for establishment candidates while making it tougher for the hard-right conservatives., I think for the last month, month and a half, conservatives were kind of licking their chops at the prospect of Mitt, Bush and Christie all running and slicing up that establishment pie. Its funny because you would think that taking out someone as formidable as Mitt Romney would make it easier for them. It makes it much harder for them, and it will be interesting to see how they approach it., This kind of upsets the apple cart. Had Romney run, it would have been almost impossible for Jeb Bush to create a foothold in Iowa and now, I think with Romney out it allows Bush and Chris Christie and Scott Walker a little more room to operate., Romneys decision also set off a scramble among the donors and bundlers who began shifting their plays., Bobbie Kilberg, a major GOP donor and bundler who with her husband has raised millions for Romney in the past, said they were going for Christie., It is clear to me that people are working the phones furiously today with donors, and even more importantly, with bundlers, she said. The group of bundlers who get money and raise money is finite so there will be a lot of competition for those people., Bush and Romney had been competing for commitments from the same donors and campaign strategists. Friday morning, Bush lauded Romney in a statement posted on Facebook., Though Im sure todays decision was not easy, I know that Mitt Romney will never stop advocating for renewing Americas promise through upward mobility, encouraging free enterprise and strengthening our national defense, Bush said. Mitt is a patriot and I join many in hoping his days of serving our nation and our party are not over., Rubio also praised Romney., Over the past two years, there hasnt been a day when I didnt think that Mitt Romney would have been a better president than Barack Obama, Rubio said in a prepared statement., I know what a difficult decision this must be given his love of our country. He certainly earned the right to consider running, so I deeply respect his decision to give the next generation a chance to lead. I wish him, Ann and his entire family the best and hope he will continue to serve our country and his community as hes done throughout his life, Rubio said., In a post on Facebook, Cruz praised Romney: His announcement today that he will not be not running in 2016 surely came after much prayer, and it cannot have been easy. Regardless of whether he is a candidate, Gov. Romney will continue to be a respected leader having a positive impact on our national discourse., House Democrats holding a retreat in Philadelphia greeted the news with a touch of sadness that a candidate who had lost twice before would not be trying again., I think Republicans are happier that hes not running, said Rep. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, the new chairman of the House Democrats campaign committee., Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said Romney probably concluded the prospect of success was not there., Look, theyre a lovely family, hes a wonderful American. Hes been a governor. Hes served our country in many ways, Pelosi said. I dont want to make a joke about his candidacy, but ... I said he was the preferred candidate, so that tells you how much strength I thought he would have in the general election., Romneys first public comments about a possible third race came Jan. 16 during a gathering of Republican National Committee members on the aircraft carrier Midway exhibit in San Diego Harbor., He said then that if he ran again he would change his focus to poverty, income inequality and foreign policy. He took after Obama and likely 2016 Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton. He also alluded to the 10 years he spent as a Mormon bishop, an experience he rarely discussed in his two earlier campaigns., On Wednesday night, Romney spoke at Mississippi State University, where he again criticized the president and Clinton. After Obama made an oblique reference Thursday to Romneys new poverty focus, Romney tweeted out a response: Mr. Obama, wonder why my concern about poverty? The record number of poor in your term, and your record of failure to remedy., But even some former aides said the new focus was a difficult one for Romney, whose 2012 campaign was riddled with comments seen as less than supportive of the needy., seema.mehta@latimes.com, mark.barabak@latimes.com,  Times staff writer Michael Muskal contributed to this story from Los Angeles; Lisa Mascaro from Washington, D.C., 1:26 p.m.: This article was updated with more comments from politicians and poltical advisors., 12:30 p.m.: This article was updated throughout and republished., 9:57 a.m: This article was updated with comments from Marco Rubio and a campaign insider., 9:30 a.m.: This article was updated with additional information about Romneys decision and comments by Jeb Bush., 8:33 a.m.: This article was updated with additional comments from Romneys call to supporters., 8:25 a.m. This artice was updated with comments from Mitt Romney., This article was originally published at 8:07 a.m.]", "Date": "20150130", "Title": "[Romney a no-go in 2016; GOP newcomer 'may have a better chance' ]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-romney-president-20150130-story.html", "Author": "[Seema Mehta, Mark Z.

{"Content": "[[, Forty-five years after her first UCLA teaching gig attracted the wrath of Gov. Ronald Reagan, Angela Y. Davis is back on campus this semester, as regents lecturer in the gender studies department. Her Thursday address in Royce Hall, about feminism and prison abolition, sums up some but not all of her work  a long academic career paralleled by radical activism. President Nixon called her a \"dangerous terrorist\" when she was charged with murder and conspiracy after a deadly 1970 courthouse shootout. She was acquitted, and since then, the woman born in the Jim Crow minefield of Birmingham, Ala., has written, taught and lectured around the world. Her iconic Afro has morphed from its 1970s silhouette; her intensity has not., Congress is working on prison-sentence reform. Many states have banned capital punishment. Isnt this encouraging?, Ive associated myself with the prison abolition movement; that does not mean I refuse to endorse reforms. There is a very important campaign against solitary confinement, a reform that is absolutely necessary. The difference resides in whether the reforms help to make life more habitable for people in prison, or whether they further entrench the prison-industrial complex itself. So its not an either-or situation., What would a just prison system look like to you?, Its complicated. Most of us in the 21st century abolitionist movement look to W.E.B. Du Bois critique about the abolition of slavery  that it was not enough simply to throw away the chains. The real goal was to re-create a democratic society that would allow for the incorporation of former slaves. [Prison abolition] would be about building a new democracy: substantive rights to economic sustenance, to healthcare; more emphasis on education than incarceration; creating new institutions that would tend to make prisons obsolete., You think prisons wont be necessary one day?, It is possible, but even [if it doesnt happen], we can move to a very different kind of justice that does not require a retributive impulse when someone does something terrible., Do you watch the prison-themed comedy-drama \"Orange Is the New Black\"?, I not only saw the series but I read [Piper Kermans] memoir. She has a much deeper analysis than one sees in the series, but as a person who has looked at the role of womens prisons in visual culture, primarily films, I think [the series] isnt bad. There are so many aspects that often dont [appear in] depictions of people in those oppressive circumstances. \"12 Years a Slave,\" for example  one thing I missed in that film was some sense of joy, some sense of pleasure, some sense of humanity., You are back this semester at UCLA, the campus from which Gov. Ronald Reagan had you fired., This was an offer I could not refuse. The students are very different from the students of 1969, 1970. Theyre so much more sophisticated, in the sense of having more complicated questions., When you consider feminism today, do you think women have retreated, except maybe when it comes to boardroom feminism?, One can talk about multiple feminisms; it is not a unitary phenomenon. There are those who assume feminism is about moving up the hierarchy into positions of power, and thats OK, but thats not what feminism does best. If the women at the bottom move up, the whole structure moves up., The kind of feminism I identify with is a method for research but also for activism., Stokely Carmichael sort of joked that the position for women in the civil rights movements Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee was \"prone.\" Are women full partners in politics today?, Perhaps not completely, but we have made a lot of progress. In the way we think about past movements, I encourage people to look beyond heroic male figures. While Martin Luther King is someone I revere, I dont like to allow his representation to erase the contributions of ordinary people. The 1955 Montgomery bus boycott was successful because black women, domestic workers, refused to ride the bus. Had they not, where would we be today?, You support free birth control and abortion, which is denounced in some quarters as genocidal., Sometimes [in] what might appear to be outlandish statements, we discover there may be a kernel of truth. While I would never argue that birth control or abortion rights constitute genocide, I have to take into consideration how sterilization has been imposed on poor people, especially people of color, and that someone like Margaret Sanger argued [birth control] was a privilege for affluent women but a duty for poorer women., What do you think of the nations first black president?, There are moments of enormous possibility, and the election was such a moment. People all over the world felt as if we were moving toward a new world. However brief that sense of euphoria was, we should not forget that. That allows us to understand what possibilities might reside in the future. [But] many people tended to deposit so many aspirations in this single individual that they failed  we failed  to do the work [to take] better advantage of that moment. People went to the polls and said, \"Weve done our job,\" and left it up to Obama., Is democracy a good chassis on which to build a political system?, I believe profoundly in the possibilities of democracy, but democracy needs to be emancipated from capitalism. As long as we inhabit a capitalist democracy, a future of racial equality, gender equality, economic equality will elude us., You ran for vice president on the Communist Party ticket in 1980 and 1984; was that about faith in the democratic process?, It was about suggesting that there are alternatives. No one believed it was possible to win, but the 80s [saw] the rise of the globalization of capital, the prison-industrial complex, and it was important to provide some alternative political analyses., Whats your thinking on communism now?, I still have a relationship, [but] Im not a member. I left the party because I didnt feel it was open to the kind of democratization that we needed. I still believe that capitalism is the most dangerous kind of future we can imagine., Why did communism fail where it did?, That would require a long conversation. There may have been economic democracy, which we lack in the West, but without political and social democracy, it just doesnt work. I dont think we should throw the baby out with the bathwater; it would be important to look at what really worked and what didnt., Like no free speech?, Yes., 2016 will be the 50th anniversary of the Black Panther Party; you were a member for a time., The civil rights movement tended to be focused on integration, but there were those who said, \"We dont want to assimilate into a sinking ship, so lets change the ship altogether.\" The emergence of the Black Panther Party marked a moment of rupture, and we are still in that moment., The party had two different kinds of activism: grass-roots activism that helped to create institutions that are still working  for example, the Agriculture Department now runs free breakfast programs. On the other hand, the posture of self-defense and monitoring the police., If one looks at the party 10-point program, every single point is as relevant or more relevant 50 years later. The 10th point includes community control of technology. That was very prescient. Its about using technologies rather than allowing them to use us., Some people must still see in you the young woman who endorsed violence against police, violence in political movements., Its important to understand the differences between that era and this era. Our relationship with guns was very different, largely revolving around self-defense. Today, when theres something like 300 million guns in the country, and weve experienced these horrendous shootings, we cant take the same position. I am totally in favor of gun control, of removing guns not only from civilians but also from police., Guns you owned were used in the 1970 kidnapping and shootout at the Marin County Civic Center. You were acquitted of all charges. I read you purchased the guns for self-defense., Yes, and I talked about the fact that my father had guns when I was growing up; our families needed to protect themselves from the Ku Klux Klan. We have laws against hate crimes [now]; I am ambivalent about [them] because oftentimes they end up being used against people who were initially the victims. Anti-lynching legislation is issued more against black kids and so-called gangs. Oftentimes the tools against racism are being used in the service of a kind of structural racism., The documentary \"Free Angela and All Political Prisoners\" makes much of your relationship with George Jackson, the prison activist killed in Soledad Prison. Too much?, I would have placed the emphasis elsewhere. If you talk to [director Shola Lynch], youll see she was working with conventional genres; she sees the film as a political drama, a crime thriller and a love story. Even so, the research she did was quite amazing. She found archival material I had never seen before. She interviewed one of the FBI agents who arrested me, and in that interview, I discovered how they caught me. Im impressed by the way the film has affected young people. It can help intergenerational conversations that teach me something and teach younger people something., What became of the radical, personal, confrontational writing of the 1960s and 70s?, Its an interesting question. In many ways we were on our own. We were experimenting. Those experiments are important because without moving into realms about which one knows nothing, there will never be any change., I expect people say to you, \"If you dont like it in America, why are you here?\", I have lived in other places but this is my home, and I feel committed to transforming this country. I have felt that way since I was a child. My mother was an activist believing in the possibilities of transforming the world. I still have not given that up., This interview was edited and excerpted from a transcription. ]", "Date": "20140506", "Title": "[Angela Y.

The network is scheduled to host a debate from Cleveland in mid-August., According to a statement by the network, first reported by the Washington Post, participation in the debate will be determined by an average of the five most recent nationwide public polls., \"We support and respect the decision Fox has made, which will match the greatest number of candidates we have ever had on a debate stage,\" saidRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus., Later in the day, CNN, which is scheduled to host a debate in September at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, released its criteria, which added another twist. Its debate will have two segments: a main forum amongthe 10 candidates with the highest average poll ratings, and an earlier session with second-tier candidates., Neither approach is quite as straightforward as it might seem. With candidates bunched close together, polling averages easily can produce different results, depending on which surveys are counted. Moreover, not all polls include the same list of candidates. Some recent ones, for example, have included Donald Trump among the options., After Fox released its statement, a spokesperson added a caveat: If a couple of candidates are tied in the polls, the number on stage could go higher than 10., CNN spelled out an elaborate tie-breaker procedure to avoid that situation in its debate, employing the most recent polls to determine the winner or, if that fails, turning to polls of the four earliest voting states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina., If the criteria were applied today, the candidates for the first debate would probably be Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Ben Carson, Chris Christie, Rick Perry and John Kasich., That would leave out the only woman in the field, Carly Fiorina, a result that many Republican officials have hoped to avoid. Former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who won Iowas caucus voting in 2012, but who has drawn much less support so far this year, would also not make the cut. Nor would Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal., Fiorinas \"super PAC\" issued a statement late Wednesday saying it was \"confident that Carlys growing momentum and support will meet and exceed\" the debate criteria., But since only a few percentage points separate the bottom several candidates on the list, the lineup could easily change by August., For more on politics and policy, follow@DavidLauter on Twitter., 5:20 p.m.: This story was updated with a statement from Carly Fiorinas super-PAC., 4:54 p.m.: This story was updated with information about the CNN debate., 3:51 p.m.: Thestory was updated with additional information about how Fox would handle the situation if candidates were tied in polling., The story was first published at 3:08 p.m.]", "Date": "20150520", "Title": "[Fox, CNN to pick top 10 in polls for GOP presidential debates]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-gop-debate-20150520-story.html", "Author": "[David Lauter]"}

{"Content": "[[, From his new perch in Washington, Ted Lieu has suffered through an East Coast winter and other confounding indignities of life as a freshman member of the House from the party out of power. No matter, he says; he learned from his predecessor, the 40-year member Henry Waxman, that influence will be marked in years and decades, not the three months Lieu has spent in the capital., For one of Lieus bases of support, however, a far swifter assertion of power is underway. The Torrance Democrats victory in Novembers election was only one sign of the surge in importance of Asian American voters and Asian American politicians., On the same night Lieu won Waxmans seat, John Chiang claimed the job of state treasurer after two terms as controller. Betty Yee, a member of the state Board of Equalization, took over as controller. Fiona Ma, a former member of the Assembly, won a seat on the tax board., Two months later in Orange County, the Board of Supervisors became majority Asian American after a special election. In San Francisco, state Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris is mounting her campaign for a U.S. Senate seat that will be open in 2016. Harris, the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father, would be the first woman of Asian heritage  and the first African American  to serve as a senator from California., \"Weve steadily been making gains,\" Lieu said with a laugh about the growing numbers of Asian American representatives. \"Were not going backwards.\", Some of the power of Asian American voters stems from their growth spurt  they were the fastest-growing ethnic group in the last U.S. census. Like Latinos before them, they are rapidly diversifying the electorate in a state where the divisions used to be binary, between black and white. And their growth in California presages growth elsewhere in the nation., But they present a tantalizing prospect for both parties, because so far they have shown less tendency to formalize their political alliances than other racial or ethnic groups. A USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll taken last month showed that 40% of Asian Americans were nonpartisan voters, 35% were Democrats and 17% Republicans. Among Latinos, by contrast, only 24% were registered as nonpartisans, while the majority were Democrats. (Only 21% of white voters were nonpartisan.), The rise of Asian American voters has spurred the same arguments that Republicans have long made about Latinos  that they are culturally conservative, share business-oriented values and should be our voters. But theyre not., In the 2012 election, exit polls showed 73% of Asian Americans nationally backed President Obama, a click higher than the 71% of Latinos who sided with him and more than double the percentage of Asian Americans who backed a Democrat for president 20 years earlier., Certainly there are differences within the complicated mix. Voters of Vietnamese heritage  like Cubans in the Latino mix  are more likely to be Republican. But the voters share far more similarities, according to Karthick Ramakrishnan, a UC Riverside professor of public policy who has researched and conducted polls about them., \"Theres language diversity, religious diversity. There are elements in which they are distinct from one another, but in terms of political orientation theres more commonality than you might think,\" he said., Asian American voters, for example, support the presidents healthcare plan and actions meant to protect immigrants in the country illegally  two issues that, as with Latino voters, distance them from many Republicans., Another element driving Asian American voters from the GOP is the partys vocal embrace of Christianity  which strikes the ears of some Hindus and others as exclusionary., \"All of this Christian conservative talk and morality politics alienates them,\" Ramakrishnan said., Neel Kashkari, the 2014 Republican gubernatorial nominee, who is of Indian heritage, served as an example that the party is trying to diversify. But he found a place on the ballot only because the party had no other establishment candidates to sacrifice to the expected reelection of Democrat Jerry Brown., To the extent that optimism breeds alliances, Browns tenure in Sacramento could prove a boon to Democrats. The USC Dornsife/ Los Angeles Times poll found that 71% of Asian American voters approved of Brown, higher than both Latinos and whites. (There were not enough black voters to separate out.), Asian American voters were also far more optimistic about the economy and about the odds facing their own generation and the next  providing grist for Democrats who will contend that gains under a Democratic president and governor would be extended under successors from the same party. (Hillary Rodham Clinton, like her husband, Bill, is widely popular among Asian Americans.), Lieu has already endorsed Clintons unannounced campaign. He is proud of the role that Asian American voters are playing: \"Diversity is what has made our country strong, and it will continue to make our country strong.\" But he also makes clear that he represents everyone in his district., \"The issues to me are not very different,\" he said. \"I believe when you move the American family forward, you also move the Asian American family forward. Issues such as job growth, education, healthcare  they are all very similar issues across the board.\", Twitter: @cathleendecker]", "Date": "20150329", "Title": "[Recent election gains show Asian American voters' power surge]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-pol-california-politics-20150329-story.html", "Author": "[Cathleen Decker]"}
{"Content": "[[, Fueled by derision for politics as usual, Donald Trump has vaulted to the top of the Republican race for president among California voters, a new USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll has found., Trump won the support of 24% of California Republicans surveyed, while Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon and lesser-known conservative favorite, was backed by 18%. More than a dozen other candidates, most of them elected politicians, resided in the single digits, far behind the leaders., The anti-establishment flavor of the Republican race contrasted with the predictability of the Democratic primary, in which longtime national front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton held an expansive lead in California over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and others., Get more national political newsand the latest from Campaign 2016 >>, California voters are reflecting national trends: Trump and Carson lead the GOP field; Clinton leads strongly among Democrats., California voters are reflecting national trends: Trump and Carson lead the GOP field; Clinton leads strongly among Democrats., The potential entrance of Vice President Joe Biden, who is considering a 2016 bid, did little to diminish Clintons dominance, the poll found. In California, as elsewhere, the path forward for Biden remains difficult barring an utter collapse of Clintons candidacy, the results suggested., Trumps support rested on his blunt and often excoriating approach to the race  an approach that has confounded political insiders  and particularly on his tough talk about illegal immigration, a subject that has ricocheted through California politics for more than two decades and helped weaken the state Republican Party. The poll indicated Trumps supporters were highly motivated by the issue., \"This is the first time I have heard a presidential candidate speak about something that is really important and has gotten out of control,\" said Mario DiPasquale. \"That is, illegal aliens, and nobody is doing anything about it.\", The 57-year-old Hawthorne Republican and Trump supporter said hed had to \"reinvent\" himself professionally twice as earlier jobs became dominated by Latinos. He blamed Latinos for taking jobs and for engaging in crime., \"I grew up with blacks; Im cool with them,\" he said. \"What Im not OK with is everywhere you go its brown people, everywhere you go.\", With nearly nine months to go before Californias presidential primary closes out the nominating season, both contests remain fluid, with the GOP race particularly open to change. Among Republicans, 1 in 5 voters polled in the state was undecided about which candidate to back, and many candidates were unknown to a quarter or more of voters interviewed. Among those planning to cast ballots in the Democratic primary, about 1 in 6 was undecided., Trumps lead over Carson was within the margin of error for the polls sample of Republicans  5.3 points in either direction. Among Democrats, who have many more voters eligible to participate in the primary, the margin was 3.6 points in either direction., The poll questioned 1,500 registered voters by telephone from Aug. 29 through Sept. 8. It was conducted by the Democratic firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Researchand the Republican firm American Viewpoint on behalf of the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Los Angeles Times., California Republicans have opted for the safe and predictable candidate in most presidential elections, so their embrace of Trump  even if it proves temporary  is notable., Yet if Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor and an archetype of a candidate successful in California, is hoping that blue-state Republicans can rescue his campaign, the poll offers little comfort. He was in a tie for a distant third place with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, each getting 6% support. Bushs father and brother won a total of four presidential primaries here  and George H.W. Bush was the last Republican to win the state in a general election, in 1988., Bush, Cruz and the other conventional politicians in the GOP race are all falling to the strong outsider tide: 47% of voters in the poll sided with three candidates who have not held elective office: Trump, Carson and Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive who lost a Senate race in California in 2010. Leaving aside the one-fifth of respondents who were undecided, well over half of those who had a favorite candidate chose a person who had never served in office., Candidates competing against Trump have hoped that the New York real estate tycoon will find himself eclipsed as the gargantuan field of 16 GOP candidates inevitably narrows. For now, the poll indicated, that is wishful thinking., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, When California Republicans were asked how they would vote if they were choosing among Trump, Carson, Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio  the four candidates who led nationally when the poll was conducted  Trump strengthened his standing, with 27% of the vote. Carson added 7 percentage points for a near-tie with Trump at 25%. Rubio and Bush eked their way into double digits, at 13% and 11% respectively., In individual head-to-head competitions, Trump clocked Bush, 47% to 32%. But outsider Carson defeated Trump, 43% to 32%., \"Right now we are all clearly watching the Donald Trump show,\" said Dave Kanevsky of American Viewpoint, the Republican polling firm. But, he noted, even popular shows can find themselves canceled., \"Trump has a high floor,\" Kanevsky said. \"But he could potentially have a low ceiling against a non-Jeb Bush candidate.\", Indeed, 35% of Republican voters polled said they would never consider voting for Trump  three times the percentage that felt that way about Carson. That would normally prove daunting, but in this years factionalized race, Trump was only fifth-highest on the list of GOP candidates shunned by their own party members in California., Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has hoped that his opposition to government spying and advocacy of changes in the criminal justice system would attract young and minority voters, was dismissed by half of Republicans surveyed., Also highly unpopular were New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Bush, all of whom had alienated more than a third of GOP respondents. Lesser-known, and thus less polarizing, were Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich., The voters early verdict was perhaps most humbling for Fiorina. Just four years after she spent tens of millions to impress them, fewer than half of California Republicans surveyed would consider voting for her, and 23% said they would never consider it., As they do nationally, Trumps California supporters represent something of a caucus of the aggrieved. They are younger and more male  he received support from 30% of male Republicans but just 18% of GOP women. His largest level of support came from men who did not attend college, 32% of whom sided with him. Generally speaking, they are among those hit the hardest by the shaky economy and opposed to immigrants in the country illegally., But Trumps current support is not limited to those voters: He won among whites, minority voters (a small and conservative slice of the GOP in California), men, nonconservatives, the young, older voters, college graduates, the married and the unmarried., Carson and Trump divided the partys conservatives and women, and the retired doctor was narrowly behind in other categories. Some voters interested in Carsons campaign described him as Trump without the bluster  an outsider lacking Trumps downsides if also his fiery appeal., Supporters of Trump and Carson had a far bleaker notion of California than other Republicans; only 5% of Trump backers and 8% of Carson voters said the state was headed in the right direction. Among supporters of other candidates, 18% said the state was going in the right direction., See the most-read stories this hour >>, Roland Lizott, a Navy veteran who works in real estate management, said Trump was \"talking a good game. ... Hes saying things a lot of people want to say.\", \"Is he going to become president? I dont believe so  we already have enough nuts running the country,\" Lizott said, laughing. He, too, said he was attracted to Trumps stance on immigration, which includes deportation of immigrants here illegally and the construction of a southern border wall., \"They just need to start enforcing the laws in this state. Any time you say anything about immigration youre a bigot, and thats not the case,\" he said. \"Theres a lot of people out here stressed about their jobs.\", Lizott, a resident of Roseville, northeast of Sacramento, said he was looking at a few candidates but liked Carson., \"Think about it: Hes a brain surgeon,\" he said. \"Hes got to think of all the possibilities before he does something. Hes not going to go off half-cocked.\", If the Republican race presented a blizzard of possibilities, the Democratic presidential contest oozed clarity., Clinton, who with husband and former President Bill Clinton has cultivated California politically for more than two decades, led her nearest active competitor, Sanders, a political independent, 42% to 26%. Other Democrats were in the low single digits  if they registered at all., Clintons victory in the 2008 presidential primary was driven by turnout among women and Latinos, and the poll indicated those groups remained bulwarks of support. She beat Sanders by 24 points among women and 37 points among Latinos. Asian voters in the survey sided with her 41% to 20%, and pluralities of liberals, moderates and conservatives also were in Clintons camp., Sanders strength in polls elsewhere has been driven by whites and liberals, and those were his strongest backers in California as well. He earned 38% of liberals to 44% for Clinton and 33% of white voters to 36% for Clinton. He came closest to toppling her among independent voters who indicated they would vote in the Democratic primary: 29% sided with Clinton and 28% with Sanders. (Democratic Party members went for Clinton 46% to 26%.), \"She has a very solid coalition of moderate-type Democrats and nonwhites that someone like Sanders or anyone from the left flank would have to overcome,\" said Drew Lieberman of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, the Democratic polling firm. \"I dont see a sign that theres enough of a protest vote out there to beat her in a head-to-head battle.\", Even when Biden was added to the candidate mix, Clinton remained relatively strong at 39%, compared with 23% for Sanders and 11% for Biden. Biden pulled votes equally from the two top candidates. The vice president was in the low double digits in almost every demographic category except for independent voters, where he won 14%, mostly at Sanders expense., Some of Clintons voters have hurried to batten down the hatches, an approach common to tumultuous campaigns waged by both Clintons. Debra Sexton, a Democrat from Corona, supported Clinton in 2008 and believes she was a good secretary of State. She dismissed the furor over Clintons use of a private server for government email as \"stupid political fodder.\", \"The more they complain about her, the more that Im going to support her,\" said Sexton, a retired photography printer. \"In all honesty, I dont see them treating the other candidates the way they do her.\" She attributed that to Clintons gender and name., But even Sexton expressed some worry about Clintons early, and rocky, efforts in the 2016 campaign., \"I wish she would relax a little more,\" Sexton said., cathleen.decker@latimes.com, Twitter: @cathleendecker. , For more on politics, go to latimes.com/decker and latimes.com/politics]", "Date": "20150913", "Title": "[California Republicans echo U.S. trends, favoring outsiders Donald Trump and Ben Carson]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-pol-prez-poll-president-20150913-story.html", "Author": "[Cathleen Decker]"}

Conservatives must come out to the polls in the upcoming elections in overwhelming numbers and make sure that our elected officials, and the next president of the United States, respect and appreciate the right of the people to define marriage as it has always been throughout our history -- the union between one man and one woman., Language like that serves to turn up the heat not only on 2014 Republicans but also on the would-becandidates who are beginning their courtship of voters. Every cycle, candidates spend a significant amount of time attempting to curry favor with influential social conservative leaders -- making stops at Bob Jones University in South Carolina, for example -- to affirm their faith in traditionalparty principles. With same-sex marriage back on the agenda, some potential candidates are likely to face a rougher road than others., Ohio Sen. Rob Portman could face a backlash from conservative groups for speaking publicly about his personal evolution on the issue after learning his son was gay. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who opposes gay marriage, has already faced criticism from social conservatives after he chose to not pursue a legal fight to block same-sex marriages in his state in 2013., On Monday, Christie declined to give an opinion on the Supreme Court ruling, according to the Star-Ledger, because he said he was not familiar with the details. That will not hold for long., They are going to have to talk about it, said Bob Vander Plaats, president and chief executive of Iowa-based Family Leader. Vander Plaats said his group and others would press the contenders on whether children deserve to be raised by a mom and a dad, and what they will do if a court oversteps its authority., This is a time to double down, Vander Plaats said after the Supreme Court decision. Americans, and for sure Iowans, are fed up with the courts injecting themselves in making marriage law., Those who did express their views were generally those who stand firmly in the anti-gay-marriage camp and who are not immediately on the ballot., Potential 2016 candidate Ted Cruz, the Texas senator and tea party darling who is trying to galvanize conservatives,called the Supreme Court decision tragic and indefensible and said itamounted to judicial activism at its worst., Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who also is seriously considering a run for president, said in a statement that marriage laws should be left to the states to determine., The Supreme Courts refusal to address these cases further places a courts judgment above the judgment of people who live in states like Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin and Indiana, who have made their collective voices heard on this issue, Perry said. This is, unfortunately, another instance of overreach by the federal government., , Contrast that with the reaction inmore narrowly divided states such as Florida and Georgia, two states with increasing numbers of younger voters. Several political analysts noted that gay marriage has hardly come up at all in the Florida governors race, where Republican incumbent Rick Scott is fending off a challenge from Democrat Charlie Crist, or in the race for U.S. Senate in Georgia, where Republican David Perdue is running against Democrat Michelle Nunn., Gay marriage in Georgia is so far on the back burner that its probably out in the pantry. It just hasnt been mentioned this year, said University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock., You have a generational divide now within the Republican Party -- for young Republicans, and even some activists out there working for candidates -- its not a big issue anymore for them, Bullock said., In Florida, much sought after in presidential years, 48% of registered voters are younger than 50, said Susan MacManus, a politics and government professor at the University of South Florida. And an additional 26% of voters declined to register either as Democrats or Republicans., Facing those numbers, there are a lot of Republicans who are looking ahead, and not looking back, and so the whole attitude about [about gay marriage] has changed considerably just in the last four or five years, she said. Young Republicans have made it very clear that [the party] needs to move away from these social issues., Florida Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi, a Republican, has been far more outspoken than Scott on the issue as she seeks reelection, MacManus said, but even she has backed away somewhat as the general election has drawn closer., In this final stretch of the midterm elections in those states, staying quiet on the issue simply may be smart politics, as Republicans put off a debate likely to escalate as 2016 nears., Twitter: @MaeveReston]", "Date": "20141007", "Title": "[Gay marriage poses a dilemma for many Republican candidates]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-gay-marriage-supreme-court-republicans-20141007-story.html", "Author": "[Maeve Reston]"}

And now hes a geezer., Anyway, his chief advisor, wife Anne Gust Brown, would kill him., So its not worth asking about., But thats too bad, in a way. Because, age aside, he never has been in better position to run., Brown has a record he can crow about as governor of the most populous, most diverse state, with the worlds eighth-largest economy. He has steered the state budget from a crippling deficit to a healthy surplus. Hes still a Washington outsider. Hes usually articulate and interesting., And hes driven, more than any presidential contender, by a cause thats far bigger than any one state: saving the planet by turning down the heat on global warming., The presidential field is in flux and flimsy. Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton is limping badly. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is a circus barker., \"In the current context, especially when you look at the Republican field, it cries out for someone who can be the grown-up in the room and has some gravitas,\" says veteran Democratic consultant Bill Carrick., Maybe  probably  Brown couldnt get elected president in 2016. But there has never been a wider opening for him. Its the opportunity of his lifetime. If only., If only he hadnt foolishly run those other times., In 1976, for crying out loud, he had been governor for only a year, repeating Ronald Reagans mistake of 1968. Moreover, Brown entered the Democratic primaries very late. He still carried three states and attracted 14% of the total popular vote. But Jimmy Carter won easily., \"When he first got in and won in Maryland, he was the most exciting candidate Id ever seen,\" says Carrick, who was working then in Washington. \"He was hot as a firecracker.\", It was a careless waste of potential., In 1980, Brown challenged Carter again. Only this time Carter was the incumbent president. And Sen. Ted Kennedy  Democratic royalty  also was competing. Brown bombed and dropped out early., Brown was asked by a reporter earlier this year whether there had been anything in his career hed like to change. \"There are a lot of things I could second-guess,\" he replied., \"The only thing that seems pretty clear was continuing to run for president in 1980 after Kennedy got in against Carter. That was a very dumb move on my part.\", And in 1992, what was that about? Brown had been out of office nine years. He ran like a crazy man  no discipline, poor planning, dumb moves., \"We are not disorganized. Our campaign transcends understanding,\" Jacques Barzaghi, Browns \"field director\" and longtime aide-de-camp, said then., One stupid move: Brown naming the Rev. Jesse Jackson as his potential running mate  the man who had angered New Yorks many Jewish voters by calling their city \"Hymietown.\", Brown ran as a populist, the \"voice for the voiceless,\" refusing to accept campaign contributions that exceeded $100. He later abandoned that notion while rebooting his political career in California., In 1992, however, he also campaigned as a Wall Streeter, advocating the \"flat tax\"  everyone pay the same income tax rate. As governor in 2012, he turned in the extreme opposite direction, selling voters a \"soak-the-rich\" tax hike that hit only Californias wealthiest., The \"prince of sleaze\"  Browns name for Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton  walloped the Californian in the decisive New York primary. Still, Brown won six states., If Brown hadnt been so politically antsy in 1976 and 1980, he just might already have been president., California voters wouldnt have been so sick of him in 1982. They probably would have elected him U.S. senator over the San Diego mayor, Pete Wilson. Then he would have been in great position to whip the Arkansas governor in 1992., You know that Brown would love to be back running again, especially with the \"princes\" wife stumbling., If he were 10 years younger, Brown told reporters a few months ago, \"yes\" he would be back on the presidential trail. But he quickly added: \"If I could go back in a time machine  I might jump in. But thats counterfactual, so you dont need to speculate.\", Brown is 77. If he ran and won, hed be older entering the White House than Reagan was leaving it. Thats not a selling point., But also like Reagan and Trump  excuse this one comparison  Brown has an appealing ring of authenticity., Hes pretty healthy and not that much older than the leading Democratic contenders. Hillary Clinton is 67. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is 73. And Vice President Joe Biden, whos edging toward the race, is 72., \"Never count Jerry out,\" Carrick says. \"Many people have written his political eulogy who no longer are involved in politics.\", Asked on NBCs \"Meet the Press\" Sunday why he didnt jump into the race, Brown replied: \"Ive got a lot to do in California.

{"Content": "[[, Gov. Jerry Brown, speaking at a conference hosted by Pope Francis, on Tuesday denounced climate change skeptics as well-financed troglodytes determined to bamboozle local leaders., Brown said he has no faith in Congress to act on global warming, and urged the 60 mayors from around the world attending the event to take action to cut greenhouse gas emissions., Its up to you guys, Brown said., Brown threw his weight behind Pope Franciss encyclical, Laudato Si, issued in May, in which the pope linked poverty to creeping climate change and urged action to alleviate both. Human trafficking also will be discussed at the two-day conference., Speaking at the conference, Pope Francis urged the United Nations to step up its campaign against climate change., I have great hopes for the Paris summit in December and hope a fundamental agreement is reached, Francis said, referring to a key meeting at which a new United Nations climate deal should be signed. ,  The U.N. needs to take a strong position on this, he added. ,  For their part, Brown and the other local leaders signed a declaration stating thathuman-induced climate change is a scientific reality, and its effective control is a moral imperative for humanity.\", Speakers at the event highlighted the role mayors can play fighting climate change, given that half the worlds population now lives in cities, which are in turn responsible for nearly three quarters of the planets greenhouse gas emissions., With mayors from San Francisco, San Jose and eight other U.S. cities in the audience, Brown gave a glowing review of his own achievements in cutting emissions in California, offering it as a template for mayors around the world to follow., California is now deriving 25% of its energy from renewable sources and has the most efficient buildings in the U.S., as well as 40% of the countrys electric cars, he said., But we are not stopping there, he said, adding he wanted renewable energy to reach 50% and gasoline use in cars and trucks to drop by 50% in 15 years., For Brown, a former Jesuit seminary student with a political career now in its fifth decade, has repeatedly said that California cannot fight global warming alone but that the state can set an example for the nation and the world. , Backing up his call to action, Brown quoted Saint Paul on man reaping what he sows, but sounded a positive note by citing Italian communist leader Antonio Gramsci, who described the pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will., He called for a campaign against the fierce opposition and blind inertia of well-financed climate change skeptics. , With national leaders proving unwilling to act, the governor called on mayors to light a fire, if I may use that metaphor  in terms of climate change, its probably the wrong one., We have very powerful opposition that, in at least my country, spends billions on trying to keep from office people such as yourselves and elect troglodytes and other deniers of the obvious science, Brown said at the conference. , New York Mayor Bill De Blasio, speaking after Brown, thanked the California governor for being the leading voice in the nation on climate change, and announced his intention to cut greenhouse gas emissions in New York by 40% by 2030, following Californias example., After flying to Rome at the weekend, ahead of the conference, Brown stayed at the Rome residence of the U.S. ambassador to Italy and met with Father Adolfo Nicols, superior general of the Jesuits., In an interview on Monday, Brown said he backed Pope Francis treatment of nature as part of Gods creation, to be safeguarded as carefully as humanity itself., He talks about the web of life and sums up the encyclical as stating everything in nature is an expression of the divine and therefore we have to take it seriously, Brown said. , The pope is dealing with the biggest threat of our time. If you discount nuclear annihilation, this is the next one. If we dont annihilate ourselves with nuclear bombs then its climate change. Its a big deal and hes on it., In the encyclical, the pope criticized the concept of buying the right to emit greenhouse gases, so-called cap-and-trade policy, which is a major component of Browns green policy for California., The strategy of buying and selling carbon credits can lead to a new form of speculation, which would not help reduce the emission of polluting gases worldwide, the pope wrote., Brown said he felt the criticism did not apply to California., California has a uniquely constructed cap and trade. It is very tightly regulated and it is not the only thing. I get the impression that [Pope Francis] thinks a market solution is not enough. We have a renewable energy standard, building standards, we have research and development, subsidized electric cars, he said., Cap and trade is designed to cut greenhouse emissions, but also to minimize any disturbances to our way of living, said Ann Carlson, a professor of environmental law at UCLA and co-director of its Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment., But in the encyclical, the pope is asking a fundamental question about whether people  specifically in the West, who on a per capita basis omit many more greenhouse emissions than those in developing countries  ought to be consuming as many resources as they do, Carlson said., Times Staff Writer Kurt Chirbas contributed to this report., ALSO, Ohios John Kasich brings heat, intrigue to 2016 GOP race, Bush and Clinton highlight sharp contrast in dueling policy speeches, Hillary Clintons political director brings key lessons from her own (losing) campaign, 9:11 a.m.: This article was updated to include comments from Pope Francis., This article was originally published at 7:11 a.m.]", "Date": "20150721", "Title": "[Gov.

{"Content": "[[, Gov. Jerry Browns inauguration speech this month was as green as the decor in the ornate Assembly chamber where he gave it. And it left Tom Steyer tickled pink. The philanthropist put millions into the 2014 elections, primarily through his NextGen Climate Action super PAC. His candidates mostly lost, but he has no regrets. Steyer has worked on political campaigns since the 1970s, including Democrat Walter Mondales 1984 presidential bid, but his formidable political voice comes from the billions he made as a hedge fund manager. Hes long invested in greener California politics, and making climate disaster a politically crucial national issue is his Cause One  like the TV spot NextGen ran during coverage of Tuesdays State of the Union speech., Your name has come up as a possible candidate for Barbara Boxers Senate seat. Are you going to run?, I havent made a decision yet. Either way, Ill be working full time to be part of the solution to the problems I care the most about., You spent nearly $75 million in the 2014 midterms. What did you get for that?, Our mission is to prevent climate disaster and preserve American prosperity. In the states we were in, we made climate a first-tier issue maybe for the first time ever. Candidates on both sides had to address the issue. It was in all the debates and all the papers. We believe turnout in places where we were on the ground was better than in 2010., Did you create single-issue climate voters?, We probably have 350,000 people across different states who said they would be climate voters. In addition we worked hard to explain why climate is a first-tier issue, both by going door to door and doing field work  presenting arguments in south Florida about why rising oceans affect people there. We tried to make it a local, human issue., Is an election campaign the best way to do that?, We believe the way social change occurs in the United States, over the last 200 years, is the democratic process. We want to be part of that process., This is the fifth anniversary of the Supreme Courts Citizens United ruling. Is outspending the other guy the sine qua non now? How do you reform money in politics if youre also a big part of it?, We agree that Citizens United is a very bad decision. We dont believe outspending your opponent is the way to go since we dont believe we will ever be outspending our opponents! If you see what the other side, the fossil fuel industry, spent to maintain the dirty energy status quo in Congress in the past two years, its a multiple of what we spent. We dont believe in hiding our heads in the sand. We have to figure out how to be effective within the process, even though there are parts of it we disagree with, Still, some critics call you a hypocrite about money in politics., What we are doing is very different from the so-called dark money groups. We are committed to using our resources openly and transparently. All of our electoral efforts are conducted through our super PAC, which discloses and reports its donors and expenditures, unlike some of the groups on the other side., Youre looked upon as the counter to the Koch brothers. Is that what you are?, We are very different from the Koch brothers. Were doing something we think is right and important. They may believe what theyre doing is right but it definitely redounds to their benefit. Second, were trying really hard to be transparent  theyre not transparent. We feel were going to win because we have the facts and right on our side. You dont have to outspend somebody if thats true., You want climate to be something every candidate has to address in the 2016 race. How do you do that?, Its important to show that it has resonance with voters they have to get. The people who care most about this statistically are the so-called rising American electorate and in particular young millennials. They have very low turnout patterns but care a lot about this issue. Other people in the so-called rising American electorate  people of color, single women  care disproportionately about this. To the extent you can reach those people, get them to be something that politicians need, thats really important., What did you learn in 2014 about making that happen?, The most powerful thing in politics is voter-to-voter contact. People take in ideas and formulate opinions by contact with other people they perceive to be trustworthy  other voters, people from their communities., Where does the public opinion battle stand?, Somewhere between two-thirds and 70% of the public agrees with us. I think the days of the climate deniers are over. To deny basic science is to risk the trust of the general public. People who used to be deniers are now what I call agnostics; theyre saying, \"Im not a scientist, Im not qualified to answer that question.\" However, that will be a very short-term answer because its kind of dopey., For example, youre not a doctor, but you have an opinion about the Affordable Care Act. Youre not a PhD in political science but you have an opinion about foreign affairs. The public is with us. The issue is not changing their minds, its making it important to them., So politicians minds have to be changed by the voters?, Yes. People can force them to move by voting, which is what I hope happens, or [climate change] events will change voting patterns and the behavior of elected officials. Im hoping we dont delay long enough that events happen that put us in a tough place., The Keystone XL pipeline is on Congress agenda. Wont someone extract the oil it would carry, regardless?, No. Whats really going on is a gigantic mining operation. They are trying to take that operation from the current 2 million barrels a day to 9 million a day. Keystone XL is 800,000 a day. Theyre trying to build five pipelines. There was never a point where they could go from 2 million to 9 million barrels without Keystone XL.

{"Content": "[[, Graphic details of the CIAs brutal interrogation program came to light Tuesday when the Senate Intelligence Committee released a 499-page executive summary of its report on the agencys practices. Weve gathered excerpts, reactions and fallout from the documents controversial release. , This marks our final update. Below, youll find compelling extracts from the Senate Intelligence Committees torture report summary, reaction to its release and context to give depth to our understanding of the governments practices after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. For more updates, go to our full coverage page. , The CIAs chief of interrogations got the job even though he had been \"orally admonished for inappropriate use of interrogation techniques\" while conducting training in Latin America during the 1980s, the Senate report says., But that interrogations chief, whose name was redacted, became so disillusioned at the treatment of detainees that he sent an email to CIA colleagues in January 2003, calling the program a train wreck waiting to happen. \"I intend to get the hell off the train,\" he wrote, adding that he was \"retiring shortly\" because he no longer wanted to be associated with the program \"in any way.\", --David S. Cloud, Read more, , Its particularly frustrating that the Senate report didnt quite succeed in settling the debate over whether torture is ever effective. In part, thats because some of the detainees were subjected to coercive interrogations before their questioners got a chance to find out what they would have said under less draconian treatment., The CIA doesnt know the answer, either. In his response to the report, CIA Director John Brennan notes, remarkably, that the agency \"failed to perform a comprehensive and independent analysis on the effectiveness of enhanced interrogation techniques.\" As a result, he says, \"The agency takes no position on whether intelligence obtained from detainees who were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques could have been obtained through other means or from other individuals. The answer to this question is and will forever remain unknowable.\", , \"I was hoping for an aha moment  that moment where wed get a definitive answer,\" said Zegart. \"That didnt happen.\", --Doyle McManus, Read more, Many things CIA Director Michael Hayden said while testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee were not true, the report found. A lengthy appendix gives examples, quoting a day of Haydens testimony from 2007 and rebutting it. , , In this snippet, Hayden says observers can call an immediate halt to any interrogation that uses enhanced techniques. The report cites a time that an objection was voiced, but CIA headquarters ordered that the enhanced interrogation continue and discouraged objections., , --Lauren Raab, Read more, David J. Phillip/AP, Ted Cruz, a potential 2016 presidential hopeful, issued a statement late on Tuesday, striking a similar tone to many Republican lawmakers who have spoken about the terror report:, , Within 48 hours, President Obama has set Guantanamo Bay detainees free, and Senate Democrats have endangered Americans all over the world by releasing classified tactics, which have since rightly been outlawed, used by the intelligence community in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The Democrats foreign policy  defined by a series of actions designed to appease our enemies and diminish the capability and morale of our military men and women  is profoundly dangerous. ,  , Every civilized nation agrees that torture is wrong. But todays partisan report will endanger lives, drive away our allies  who have never been more needed than now  and undermine the ability of our intelligence officers and soldiers to protect our national security. After six years, enough with saying everything is George W. Bushs fault. Its sad that, with all the threats we face across the globe, Senate Democrats are still more interested in scoring political points against the Bush Administration than in working together to keep America safe and our military strong. , , --Julie Westfall, Associated Press, One of the most spectacular stories that became public in the period after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks was the accusation that a Brooklyn, N.Y.-born convert to Islam named Jose Padilla had plotted to build a radioactive dirty bomb that would be detonated in the U.S., The charge was dropped long ago by the government, which successfully prosecuted Padilla on charges of conspiring to help foreign jihadist fighters. But vivid tales are hard to dispel, as even the CIA officers who helped pursue Padilla admitted in internal messages, according to the Senate report., The report quotes an October 2005 message from the head of the CIAs Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Group under the heading Dont Put All Your Uranium in One Bucket., , KSM refers to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the Al Qaeda operative who masterminded the Sept. 11 attacks., IND or RDD refers to nuclear devices. , --Bob Drogin, Associated Press, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has publicly accused both the Bush and Obama administrations of tramping on civil liberties in the name of national security, said he was reluctant to comment on the report until hed had time to read it, but initially he had mixed feelings., Its important to say were not going to do that [torture]. But the gruesomeness of the details may well inflame people, he said. Whether or not you have to go into all the gory details, whether thats good for the country, maybe not., , Read more, AFP / Getty Images, Did torturing detainees actually produce intelligence that U.S. officials didnt already have or that couldnt have been obtained otherwise? The Senate report concludes that it did not., , CIA officials say the evidence does not support such a sweeping conclusion, although they also no longer say that the interrogations clearly saved lives, as the agency routinely did during the Bush administration., , The report and the CIA differ most clearly on the question of whether torture helped uncover Osama bin Ladens hideout in Pakistan by leading U.S. agents to Bin Ladens courier, a man known as Abu Ahmed al Kuwaiti., , One of the main sources for Kuwaitis identity and importance was an Al Qaeda figure, Hassan Ghul, who was captured in Iraqs Kurdistan region. Ghul was initially interrogated with standard questioning techniques in January 2004. Later, he was transferred to a CIA prison where he was shaved, placed in a stress position and deprived of sleep for 59 hours until he began hallucinating and having irregular heartbeats., , The Senate report concludes that Ghuls useful statements, in which he referred to Kuwaiti as one of Bin Ladens closest associates, came before he was tortured. It quotes a CIA officer who said he sang like a Tweety Bird in those initial sessions., , The CIA says the later interrogations produced important information that corroborated Ghuls earlier statements and that was more concrete than what he had said earlier. The Senate report disputes that, citing CIA documents written at the time. -- David Lauter , The secretary of State might \"blow his stack if he were to be briefed on whats been going on,\" a CIA email said. , , --Lauren Raab, As Americans processed the details of the CIAs brutal interrogation of terrorism suspects, President Obama defended Senate Democrats decision to make the information public. , There was never going to be a perfect time to release this report, Obama said in an interview with Telemundo recorded Tuesday, according to a transcript. But, he said, one of the things that sets us apart from other countries is that when we make mistakes, we admit them., He said interrogation tactics the CIA used in the years following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks amounted to torture. While acknowledging that the disclosure of the CIA programs details now has potential ramifications overseas, that risk is outweighed by a need for accountability, Obama said. , It was important for us to release this so that we can account for it  and hopefully make sure that we dont make those mistakes again, Obama said. Whats clear is that the CIA set up something very fast without a lot of forethought to what the ramifications might be. Some of these techniques that were described were not only wrong, but also counterproductive because we know that often times when somebody is being subjected to these kinds of techniques, that theyre willing to say anything in order to alleviate the pain and the stress., Obama said he is confident that the CIA has reformed. , Anybody who was doing the kinds of things that are described in the report  would be directly violating the orders that Ive issued, he said. , --Evan Halper, The first detainee held in the old abandoned brick factory north of Kabul became the model for what would transpire in the cave-like halls of a CIA interrogation facility known as the Salt Pit., Ridha al-Najjar, an alleged former bodyguard for Osama bin Laden, often was left alone in the shadows, under a barrage of shrieking music, cold and shackled and hooded, handcuffed to an overhead bar for 22 hours a day, according to the Senate intelligence committee report released Tuesday., Later, another detainee, Gul Rahman, believed to have served in a security detail for an Afghan warlord, would die there. He was dragged through the dirt and grime of the corridors, his mouth taped, his clothes falling off. , Guards slammed and punched him, and left him shackled to a concrete floor in a sweatshirt but no pants. Officials said he probably died of hypothermia, though his face, legs, shoulders and waist were cut and bruised., A few months later in March 2003, with the outside world still unaware of the facility, a lead CIA officer at the secret site was presented a $2,500 cash award for his consistently superior work, the report states, For two years, about 64 detainees filled the factory floor, the darkened hallways and small side rooms. The doors swung open in September 2002, a year after the hijacked airplanes of Sept. 11. Inside, the Senate report concludes, the CIA fostered a culture of brutal interrogation tactics and torture, often led by untrained and unsupervised officers. -- Richard A. Serrano, , The CIAs justifications for the often-brutal interrogations of prisoners shifted depending on circumstances, the Senate report found. A prime example is the case of a Pakistani man named Janat Gul., Gul was captured in June 2004, based in part on statements by a CIA informant identifying him as a facilitator for Al Qaeda who had knowledge of plans to conduct attacks in the U.S. in the weeks before the 2004 elections., Some CIA officers doubted the informants reliability, but CIA Director George J. Tenet requested special permission to use enhanced interrogation techniques on Gul, saying it could yield intelligence necessary to save American lives by disrupting the pre-election plot., The interrogations stretched from July through September, even though the personnel at the detention site said Gul seemed to have little information. In the fall, the informant admitted to fabricating Guls connection to Al Qaeda, the report says. , In April 2005, the CIA justified interrogating Gul by saying it had enabled them to determine that the informant was unreliable. It still had Gul in custody., The CIA did not acknowledge that the assets fabricated reporting was the reason that Janat Gul was subjected to the techniques in the first place, the report notes. -- David Lauter, Read more, The CIA shaved the head and face of a detainee and exposed him to loud noise in a room while \"unclothed and subjected to uncomfortably cool temperatures.\" CIA officials have told Capitol Hill lawmakers that all detainees were offered the opportunity to cooperate before being subject to enhanced interrogation techniques. However, it was revealed that this detainee was subjected to the techniques prior to any sort of discussions. , , --Kurtis Lee , \"We would be very happy to sit down with Director Brennan and go over specific names\"--@SenFeinstein re Brennans stmt that torture worked., Alex Wong / Getty Images, Former CIA officials have launched www.ciasavedlives.com to rebut the conclusions reached in the report on the agency interrogation tactics released Tuesday by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. , , The website features a statement by former CIA Director George J. Tenet, who was head of the CIA during the time of most of the incidents detailed in the report by the committees Democratic majority staff. Tenet wrote that the report does damage to U.S. national security, to the men and women of the Central Intelligence Agency, and most of all to the truth., , Tenet argues the documents being released in conjunction with the report make clear that the CIA acted legally and never misled Congress. , At a time of grave threat to the United States the program was effective in saving American and allied lives and in preventing another mass casualty attack on American soil, he wrote. It is regrettable that the Committee consciously chose to denigrate the integrity and performance of men and women who gave their all to protect the country without interviewing any of them, or holding a single congressional hearing., , --Evan Halper, Abu Zubaydah, a prisoner at Guantanamo Bay, spent 266 hours  about 11 days over a span of 20 days  in a coffin-size box as part of a CIA interrogation technique. Interrogators told Zubaydah that the only way he would leave the facility was in a coffin.   , , --Kurtis Lee , In the facility, referred to as COBALT in the Senate report but code-named Salt Pit by the CIA, conditions were so dungeon-like that interrogators wore headlamps to navigate pitch-dark passageways., , Read more, CIA officials detained two former sources who spent 24 hours shackled in a standing sleep deprivation position. The two detainees had attempted to contact the CIA prior to their detention, but the message they sent was not translated by agency officials until after the detainees were subject to enhanced interrogation techniques.  , , --Kurtis Lee, Read more, Assoicated Press, Records indicate that President Bush was not briefed on interrogation techniques until April 2006. This briefing came nearly four years after the program began and Bush expressed discomfort from an image of a detainee chained to the ceiling and clothed in a diaper. , , --Kurtis Lee , Revelations about Central Intelligence Agency mistreatment of captive terrorism suspects spurred worldwide revulsion Tuesday and provided ammunition to foreign critics who accuse the United States of a double standard on human rights at home and abroad., \"Winning the crown for Most Appalling Human Rights Record in the Western World could be a tough tournament\" following the release of the CIA torture report, wrote Sydney Morning Herald columnist Andrew P. Street. The Senate report not only confirmed abusive techniques like waterboarding and prolonged \"stress positions\" but that torture garnered no useful information, Street added., , \"Now we know how bad things were, and how out of control the CIA was, as it leapt into action in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks,\" Britains Independent newspaper began its report on the details released on interrogation practices that it lamented \"the CIA still refuses to acknowledge as torture.\" --Carol J. Williams, Read more, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who disagreed with the release of the report, said on the Senate floor, \"What we are doing today is a not a sign of weakness. It is a sign of the ultimate strength. That you can self-correct, that you can reevaluate, and you can do some soul searching and you can come out with a better product.\", Another clue to political motive, partisan report offers zero recommendations for improving intelligence interrogation practices #dronesRus, The release of todays report will not make Americans safer. What it will do is almost certainly put our citizens... http://t.co/zcVZa8ZMkp, I regret that the Senate Intelligence Committee has publicly released this report: http://t.co/npRECnOSpY, The report released today contains no recommendations and offers only a partisan account of last decades counterterrorism efforts, Despite CIA officers voicing concerns over the interrogation program the report concludes that the agency failed to take action. Often times, the CIA allowed inaccurate information to remain as the CIAs official position, notes the report. , , --Kurtis Lee, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed clammed up after interrogators used techniques that included subjecting him to nudity, sleep deprivation and rectal rehydration. Only after agents adopted a softer Mr. Rogers persona  did he become more cooperative with agents. In the report, they describe future interrogations as some of the best sessions. , , --Kurtis Lee , ABC News, During interrogations of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, a Saudi Arab believed to be associated with the 2000 USS Cole bombing, a CIA agent pointed a pistol near his head in an effort to obtain information. This incident occurred in 2002 and according to the report released Tuesday, al-Nashiri did not provide any additional threat information during, or after, these interrogations,\" according to the report. , , --Kurtis Lee , In an op-ed published in The Times, Dianne Feinstein writes about the release of the report:, , \"In the wake of 9/11, we were desperate to bring those responsible for the brutal attacks to justice. But even that urgency did not justify torture. The United States must be held to a higher standard than our enemies, yet some of our actions did not clear that bar. It is time to publicly examine how that happened., , The administration has known for months that this document would become public and has been making every effort to safeguard U.S. personnel and interests abroad. But the bottom line is, torture occurred, and we must own up to our actions and move forward.\", Read more, The CIA faced pushback from several nations about housing clandestine operations facilities. For the United States, this was a persistent challenge. It had to transfer prisoners from every country, the report says, , --Kurtis Lee , Many Republicans have been sharply critical of releasing the report at this time, warning it could exacerbate threats to the U.S. and its allies. , , Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the incoming chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called its findings \"a fiction,\" and urged the public to carefully review the Republicans official response. , , Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), one of only three members of the committee who voted against releasing the report, said it was being published only for the \"partisan joy\" Democrats would feel \"trying to embarrass people in the Bush administration.\", , AFP/Getty Images, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said a new Senate report detailing abuses in the CIAs post-9/11 interrogation practices would strengthen Americas security and its standing in the world, breaking with others in his party who warned that its release put the U.S. at risk., , In a Senate floor speech immediately following Sen. Dianne Feinsteins (D-Calif.) presentation of the Intelligence Committees report, McCain said releasing it empowered the American people to reach their own conclusions about CIA tactics and whether they made the nation safer., , \"The truth is sometimes a hard pill to swallow,\" McCain said. \"It sometimes causes us difficulties at home and abroad. It is sometimes used by our enemies in attempts to hurt us. But the American people are entitled to it, nonetheless.\", , McCain made only passing reference to his own history as a prisoner of war in Vietnam as he condemned torture as inconsistent with U.S. values, saying he knew from \"personal experience that the abuse of prisoners will produce more bad than good intelligence.\" -- Michael A. Memoli, Associated Press, Virtually no one who has any familiarity with the Senate Intelligence Committees report on CIA interrogation practices is neutral, the Director of National Intelligence, James R. Clapper, said in a message to the staffs of the governments intelligence agencies., , Proponents of publication ardently believe that the report must be issued to cleanse a stain on the pages of our history, and to ensure that the practices it describes are never repeated.  Others, with equal conviction, believe that the report is unfair and biased; fails to account for the immediate impact of the attacks on 9/11on American citizens and on those in government charged with protecting the country; and will result in greater jeopardy to American citizens, facilities and interests overseas, Clapper wrote., , As President Obama has made clear, some things were done that should not have been done  and which transgressed our values, he said. We have since enacted laws, implemented Presidential orders and established internal policies to ensure that such things never happen again., At the same time, Clapper also sought to defend the CIA officials who were involved in the interrogations. The officers who participated in the program believed with certainty that they were engaged in a program devised by our government on behalf of the President that was necessary to protect the nation, that had appropriate legal authorization, and that was sanctioned by at least some in the Congress, Clapper wrote., , I dont believe that any other nation would go to the lengths the United States does to bare its soul, admit mistakes when they are made and learn from those mistakes.  Certainly, no one can imagine such an effort by any of the adversaries we face today. -- David Lauter, The Obama administration sought Tuesday to paint the release of the reports executive summary as in the interest of transparency, pointing to the fact that 93% of the summary, which runs nearly 500 pages, is declassified. , By being open about what happened, we resolve to never use these techniques again, a senior administration official said in a call with reporters. , The report itself, more than 6,700 pages, will not be released. And the administration has, as recently as last week, tried to delay the release of the summary. It also has for years declined to pursue criminal charges against anyone associated with the brutal techniques described in the report. Administration officials would not discuss why., \"The release of this type of information and this type of transparency helps cement the notion that we should not do these things, the official said.-- Christi Parsons, Some detainees were subject to rectal rehydration without any noted medical necessity. The rehydration was used as a form of enhanced interrogation along with sleep deprivation and water boarding, the report says., , --Kurtis Lee, Associated Press, The CIA quickly attacked the report, noting that the program was found to be legal by the Justice Department under the Bush administration, but acknowledging that the interrogations were ultimately flawed., The most serious problems occurred early on and stemmed from the fact that the agency was unprepared and lacked the core competencies required to carry out an unprecedented, worldwide program of detaining and interrogating suspected Al Qaeda and affiliated terrorists, CIA Director John Brennan, pictured, said in a statement.  In carrying out that program, we did not always live up to the high standards that we set for ourselves and that the American people expect of us. -- Christi Parsons , Read more, The CIA allowed individuals with histories of violence to become agents involved in the interrogation units, according to the report. , , Jakub Kaminski / EPA, The White House said Tuesday that President Obama placed a call to the prime minister of Poland, home to one of the black sites referred to in the Senate committee report. The names of the countries are blacked out in the unclassified report. , In their Monday call, Obama thanked Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz, pictured, for Polands \"significant contributions to the missions in Afghanistan and Iraq,\" according to a statement from the White House. The two leaders \"agreed on the need for continued international cooperation in support of these missions,\" the statement says. , --Christi Parsons, Interrogation techniques used by the CIA were far worse than officials represented to lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Abu Zubaydah, the CIAs first detainee, who is currently housed in Guantanamo Bay, was the first to endure the torture techniques, the report says., , But \"we fight also for an idea,\" & using torture undermines that  cause, McCain says. \"Our enemies fight without conscience, we must not.\", As many as 26 detainees were wrongly held and did not meet the detention standard in the Sept. 11 Memorandum of Notification, according to the report., , Saying that the CIA engaged in activities that were \"a stain on our values and our history,\" Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) defended the release of a Intelligence Committee report exposing abuses of its interrogation program as an essential step to show the world that the U.S. \"is big enough to admit when it is wrong.\", , In a speech on the Senate floor detailing the work of the committee she chairs, Feinstein said the report was not intended to be a condemnation of the CIA as a whole. The report actually finds that \"surprisingly few people\" designed, carried out and managed the program. But such behavior occurred in part because of ineffective oversight of the program, and a failure to fully and factually brief senior officials and lawmakers., , Feinsteins remarks on the Senate floor, which lasted nearly a full hour, injected added drama to the end of a congressional session otherwise devoted to a major spending package, and was a break from genial speeches of the past weeks bidding farewell to departing lawmakers. --Michael A.

Sign up for the free Essential California newsletter >>, On Friday, prominent black activists offered an answer that has been in the works for months,introducing a comprehensive policy platform to end killings by the police in the U.S. and said they will track and hold2016 candidates accountable for their stances., \"Campaign Zero,\" marks the most sweeping and detailed policy platform to emerge along withthe Black Lives Matter movement. On a slickly produced website, itproposes10 reform tenets, manybacked with specific policy proposals to end the hundreds of police killings that happen annually in the U.S., The campaignspillarsinclude limiting police use of force, beefing up oversight of police departments with civilian reviewboards and equipping officers withbody cameras. The activistscall for an end to aggressive police tactics and heavy fines when it comes to minor infractions thattend tofall disproportionatelyon black Americans., The group also adopted model police programs and proposals from around the country. A call to end police ticket quotas points toIllinois law as a reference. A proposal to restrict the use of SWAT teams except for crisis situations cites Cincinnati police policy. One proposal to strengthen oversight suggests supporting an existing congressional billthat would incentivizeindependent investigations of police misconduct., Campaign Zero was created by DeRay Mckesson, Johnetta Elzie, Brittany Packnett -- three of the most prominent activists to emerge during last yearsunrest in Ferguson, Mo. --andSamuel Sinyangwe, a San Francisco-based policy expert., Weve always had demands,\" said Mckesson, who shared the proposals with the hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers he has amassed since the protests in Ferguson. He said Campaign Zero has collected thosedemands made by various activists around the U.S. as police use of force has become a fixture of public debate., Now that theres this awareness,we have an opportunity to end police violence, and this is a blueprint for how we can do it,\" Mckesson said., Protesters associated with the national movement that emerged after the protests inFerguson have been criticizedin recent months for carrying out disruptive demonstrationsbut not engaging as much with the less dramatic processes of policymaking., Other modern, social-media driven movements in the U.S. and abroad have come under similar criticisms. There wereOccupy Wall Streets leaderless, often directionless protest encampments and the Tahrir Square activists in Egypt who proved influential on Twitter butpowerless at the ballot box., The term \"Black Lives Matter\" has alsodrawn some confusion because it is a decentralized organization that also serves as a rallying cry and a hashtag -- and now a quick media shorthand to collectively refer to the new generationof black activists., The founders of Campaign Zero, although they do not call themselves leaders and dont claim to speak for others, include activists who have accumulatedpower and influencein the form of large social media followings and I-was-there credibility., As a result, they have drawn the attention of presidential campaigns undoubtedly hoping to secure votes from African Americans in the next election., On Monday, Mckesson tweeted at U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders official account to ask, \"The first draft of your racial justice platform has promise. When will you be available to discuss enhancements w/ folks?\", Sanders account responded, \"Lets do it. We will [private message] you this week to arrange.\", \"Weve spoken to staffers on [former Maryland Gov. Martin] OMalleys campaign, on Hillarys campaign, and Sanders, maybe all within the last two weeks or so,\" said Elzie, who has 71,000 Twitter followers. The lines of communication are open for sure., The activists behind Campaign Zero were quick to say that they were not representative of the whole movement but that they had also solicitedsuggestions from other activists and would be open to changes in their platform., Elzie added, \"The four of us cant speak for every black person in America.\" However, she added, As clich as the phrase is, knowledge really is power in this case. I want people to make the best-informed decisions for themselvesand their community, and I think Campaign Zero definitely helps., For instance, Elzie said, she scrolled over the Campaign Zero tableshowing presidential candidatesand whether theyd taken a specific stand on the activists 10 core issues. The Democratic candidates had many boxes filled in with positions, but the Republicans were empty., It maps out plain as day who has spoken on what,\" Elzie said.

{"Content": "[[, Have you heard that Hillary Rodham Clinton is now a grandmother? Surely you have. But did you know that as a young girl she wanted to be an astronaut? Or that she played on a softball team called the Good & Plenties, with pink and white uniforms?, The source of all that information is Clinton herself. And actually, just call her by her first name. \"Hillary is fine by me,\" she recently told a New Hampshire voter who asked how he should address her., After more than two decades in the public eye, Clinton entered her second presidential race this spring with nearly universal name recognition. But her campaign staff viewed the situation differently, calling her the least-known famous person in the world; the public view is of the former first lady, senator and secretary of State, but not the woman herself. So as Clinton tours early primary states and holds intimate gatherings with voters, she seems to go out of her way to share the kinds of details voters may not have known., Her effort to be relatable has been mocked by \"Saturday Night Live,\" among others, but it is vital to her election chances: Polls have shown the public taking an ever-more-dim view of her since she left the State Department., \"Americans dont know the first 35 years of her life. And thats not what happens with most candidates,\" said Jennifer Palmieri, the campaigns communications director. \"They dont emerge on the national scene without you understanding where they came from. So we thought it was important: Lets go all the way back to what originally motivated her.\", In her campaign kickoff rally, she shared her mothers searing personal story  abandoned by her parents, shipped to California and forced to work difficult jobs to get by  to explain how she learned the importance of perseverance and hard work, and how \"everyone needs a chance and a champion.\" In an economic speech in New York on Friday, she recalled \"watching my father sweat over the printing table in his small fabric shop in Chicago.\", And yes, it means talking a lot about her first grandchild, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, as she explains her vision for the future. Insisting Sunday on the importance of acting on climate change, she told supporters at a campaign stop in western Iowa that \"Im just a grandmother with two eyes and a brain and I know that this is an issue that we have to address.\", TRAIL GUIDE: Daily tour through the wilds of the 2016 presidential campaign >>, Its often said that elections can boil down to a contest of who would a voter rather have a beer with  a cliche centered on the importance that campaigns and political press ascribe to a candidates approval ratings. And a string of recent polls has shown that Clintons standing among the public has tumbled since she reentered the political arena., Gallup published data Friday showing that more voters viewed her unfavorably than favorably for the first time since 2008. Her 43% favorable rating was down from a peak of 66% in 2012 when she still served as secretary of State. Quinnipiac polling from key swing states released earlier in the week found her standing was even worse in key potential general election battleground states, including Iowa., Campaign officials have minimized the importance of those poll numbers, while noting that Clinton had higher favorable ratings than any other presidential candidate. But they say one of the first hurdles they recognized in the early stage of this campaign was showing voters how the issues that Clinton says she is fighting for are grounded in her own experiences, many of which might still be unfamiliar to them., \"No matter what that [favorability] number is, we would be doing this effort now to explain what drives her and why shes doing this,\" Palmieri said. \"Thats just a fundamental question that I think is very revealing about the kind of president somebody is going to be.\", Clintons personal approach is a marked contrast from how she campaigned in 2008, when her focus at the outset was highlighting her experience, said Mo Elleithee, a Democratic strategist who now serves as executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service., \"She deserves a lot of the blame for that for not opening up and letting people see who she was as much as she should have over the years. Because when they do, they like her,\" said Elleithee, who was a spokesman for Clintons 2008 campaign., He said the candidate he sees now is more like the Clinton who emerged late in the 2008 campaign, when she won a string of late primaries even after then-Sen. Barack Obama had essentially locked up the Democratic nomination for president., \"She started to do it, but it was too late, mathematically. But when she did it, man, did she catch fire,\" he said. \"I think she understands this time that one, it helps people understand why she gets them, why she will fight for them, why they should trust her. And two, its who she is.\", The Clinton campaigns initial approach in 2008 was guided in part by the hurdle her team believed she needed to overcome as a female candidate. Clinton addressed that Thursday at an event in South Carolina., \"I really had a lot to prove because people had to think that a woman could be president,\" she said. \"This time it seems easier, that people are much more open.\", Amy Walter, a national political analyst for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said some of the concern about Clintons likability is overstated at this early phase of the campaign., \"It could be a problem or could not be a problem depending on who her opponent is. And we dont know what voters are going to be emphasizing in the fall of 2016,\" she said., But there is value in Clinton sharing more about her personal story., \"I dont think you can be reintroduced to someone that youve met before and youve known for 25 years. But if I find out something about someone I didnt know, that maybe helps me get greater insight about who they are, then I would be willing to put that into consideration,\" Walter said. \"The real challenge for her, though, will be that it has to look honest and authentic and not staged. Thats always difficult to do in the midst of the campaign.\", Clinton appears most at ease in discussing Charlotte, sometimes in passing, but often in connection to policy, such as her focus on early childhood education., At one recent event she painted a picture of herself, a potential future president, and her former president husband sitting with their granddaughter, sometimes talking, sometimes reading, sometimes singing., \"She does have some Clinton genes,\" she said of Charlotte. Then she joked, \"Her problem is probably shes talking too much.\", michael.memoli@latimes.com, ALSO:, In Alhambra, an Asian market replaces a Ralphs and stirs cultural anxiety, Chinas stock market drops 8.5%, its biggest single-day fall since 2007, Mexico is cracking down on U.S. boaters who venture into its waters]", "Date": "20150727", "Title": "[Facing unfavorable ratings, Clinton shares personal details to be more relatable]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-clinton-likability-20150727-story.html", "Author": "[Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, He hasnt used it much. But President Obama says he suspects his veto pen will get far more use in the next two years with Republicans in control of Congress., Still, the president said in an interview released Monday, he remains hopeful that the goodwill shown by Republican leaders in the recent lame-duck session will carry over into the new year  optimism that doubles as a challenge., Youve got Republicans in a position where its not enough for them simply to grind the wheels of Congress to a halt and then blame me, Obama told National Public Radio in the interview, conducted before he left for Christmas vacation in Hawaii. They are going to be in a position in which they have to show that they can responsibly govern, given that they have significant majorities in both chambers., Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) have been plotting the course for a GOP-led Congress since before Novembers sweeping election wins for the party. Top Senate Republicans, in particular, have said how important it is for the partys eventual presidential nominee that Congress avoid self-inflicted wounds in 2015 as the primary process begins to unfold., But both Republicans and the president know that any serious work to find compromise will invite criticism from their respective bases that they have given in to the other side. So in the weeks since the midterm election, both sides have played a delicate game by promising to do business with the opposite party while also vowing to hold firm when necessary., Since the election, McConnell has vowed to show that the Senate can function and has ruled out new government shutdowns. But he also has promised a new effort to undercut the presidents healthcare law and to set a vote on the Keystone XL pipeline as the Senates first order of business in January., In the NPR interview, Obama said there were areas of agreement that would be priorities come January, particularly finding ways to further the economic recovery. But he acknowledged that the Democrats midterm losses would put him in more direct confrontation with congressional Republicans., I havent used the veto pen very often since Ive been in office, partly because legislation that I objected to was typically blocked in the Senate, which was in Democrats hands. Now I suspect there are going to be some times where Ive got to pull that pen out. And Im going to defend gains that weve made in healthcare; Im going to defend gains that weve made on environment and clean air and clean water., Michael Steel, a spokesman for Boehner, said the interview indicated that Obama was doubling down on his go-it-alone strategy, rather than listening to the American people, who want us to work together to get things done for the country., The president said immigration was an area in which Republicans might change their approach as they face a new political reality heading into 2016  even though many in the GOP want to roll back recent executive actions he took to defer deportation for as many as 5 million more immigrants in the U.S. illegally., Some Republicans voted for a comprehensive bill in the Senate that in many ways was more generous than I was able to offer through executive action, he said. So, the question then becomes, by me having taken these actions, does that spur those voices in the Republican Party who I think genuinely believe immigration is good for our country? Does it spur them to work once again with Democrats and my administration to get a reasonable piece of legislation done? Or does it simply solidify what I do think is ... a nativist trend in parts of the Republican Party?, Obama addressed a range of other topics in the interview, including Cuba, Iran and the renewed debate over race relations following the deaths of black men  Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and Eric Garner in New York  in confrontations with white police officers. Grand juries have declined to indict either officer, triggering protests and unrest., The president said he did not believe that the nation was more racially divided now than before he took office, but that the recent discussions about the relationship of minority communities and law enforcement is healthy., When its in the news and you see something like Ferguson or the Garner case in New York, then it attracts attention, he said. But I assure you, from the perspective of African Americans or Latinos in poor communities who have been dealing with this all their lives, they wouldnt suggest somehow that its worse now than it was 10, 15 or 20 years ago., The president said he was confident that his recently created task force on police practices would lead to tangible progress on the issue, as opposed to simply stewing in the hopelessness of race relations in this country., michael.memoli@latimes.com, Twitter: @mikememoli, , , 5:59 p.m.: The story was updated throughout with new information., The story was originally published at 2 a.m.]", "Date": "20141229", "Title": "[Obama hopes to work with Republicans, but he has his veto pen ready]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-obama-npr-interview-20141229-story.html", "Author": "[Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, Heeding the call of his own voice, celebrity developer Donald Trump announced Wednesday the formation of a presidential exploratory committee, flirting  again  with a contest he stands no chance of winning., His declaration, with a grandiosity that has become a Trump trademark, did nothing to change the dynamic of a quickening and increasingly competitive race for the 2016 Republican nomination., But in his loud, blunderbuss fashion, the attention-hungry Trump has underscored a growing phenomenon: Where long-shot candidates once ran to promote a cause  Eugene McCarthy, for instance, seeking to end the Vietnam War, or Steve Forbes pitching the flat tax  these days the pursuit of the White House has become a self-promotional ploy for some, exercised for fun and profit., Herman Cain, a pizza chain executive, parlayed his snappy performances in the 2012 debates into a national following and a syndicated radio program. Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor and diet guru, landed his own Fox News show after an unsuccessful 2008 bid; even as he mulls another presidential run in 2016, Huckabee has mined his support network for commercial prospects., Others in the current Republican field  Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, and Carly Fiorina, the fired Hewlett-Packard chief executive and 2010 California candidate for U.S. Senate  seem to have little chance of winning their partys nomination. Each has done extraordinarily well, however, raising their profile across the country, boosting lecture fees and raising the prospect of other lucrative opportunities., Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, and George E. Pataki, a former New York governor, have done nothing to discourage far-fetched talk of winning the White House; their trips to the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire have only drummed up attention., Trump, for his part, has publicly contemplated a presidential bid in each of the last four election cycles, presumably less for the financial benefit than for the satisfaction of his ego. In 1999, he formed an exploratory committee that went nowhere. In 2011, he spent weeks weighing a candidacy with extravagant fanfare before saying he would not run., In recent months, he began publicly musing once more about a possible run, wangling invitations to several candidate forums. Announcing his newly formed committee on Wednesday, Trump declared, \"I am the only one who can make America truly great again.\", The general response was a combination of eye-rolling and derision., \"If Donald Trump is a candidate, why not anyone who made it to the finals of The Bachelor?\" asked Marty Kaplan, a former Democratic speechwriter who now teaches at USCs Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism., Polls suggest there is little appetite for a Trump candidacy, his assertions notwithstanding. A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey found nearly three-quarters of Republican primary voters could not see themselves supporting the New York City real estate mogul and reality-TV personality, the worst showing of any GOP prospect., But the nature of presidential politics has changed drastically over the last several decades  especially in the last few years  giving people like Trump the incentive and wherewithal to run even if they cannot seriously compete, much less win the White House., Candidates once had to pass muster with party bosses, governors or other elected officials who decided which prospects had the combination of experience, savvy and potential to make them strong contenders. \"To be taken seriously,\" said Stuart Rothenberg, publisher of a nonpartisan campaign newsletter, \"you needed political credentials.\", But the parties have shriveled as power brokers, especially in light of recent court rulings that have given wealthy donors considerably more clout., The round-the-clock news cycle, perpetuated by cable TV and social media and their endless appetite for fresh material, have also made it easier to gain exposure and build a political following absent any political accomplishments., \"A candidate thinks, What the hell, Ill announce and get on Sean Hannity or Ed Schultz or some talk-radio program,\" Rothenberg said, referring to two of cables political show hosts. \"It seems to have diluted the importance of what would traditionally be thought of as markers for credible candidates.\", The result can be entertaining, for those who enjoy campaign theater, but damaging to the more serious presidential contenders., To gain notice, long-shot candidates have every incentive to stake flamboyant or extreme positions, forcing others in the field to respond. (In the 2012 campaign, Trump gave prominent voice to those who falsely claimed President Obama was born in Kenya and was therefore not a U.S. citizen.) That, in turn, can color broader perceptions of the party., There is also the matter of taking up space, both physically and in the minds of voters; the upcoming presidential debates are a particular concern, said Scott Reed, a veteran GOP strategist., \"Republicans learned a lesson in the last cycle about letting the debates get out of control,\" said Reed, who suggested the inclusion of several less-plausible candidates overshadowed \"the seriousness of the event\" and created \"a caricature that was negative for the party.\", The Republican Party has taken steps to exert greater control over the 2016 GOP debate regimen, limiting their number and giving conservative media a greater voice in questioning the candidates. But a decision on who will participate  and, specifically, whether Trump will be invited, should he run  will be left to others., Allison Moore, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, said \"the networks will announce the debate parameters well in advance of the first debate,\" tentatively set for August., Trump  and others angling for attention  will doubtless be heard from many times before then., mark.barabak@latimes.com, Twitter: @markzbarabak]", "Date": "20150319", "Title": "[Presidential long shots often win big after losing election]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-presidential-chaos-20150319-story.html", "Author": "[Mark Z.

{"Content": "[[, Heres an ironclad guarantee: Californias next state election will be tons more interesting than our just-concluded snoozer., Make that the next two elections  in 2016 and 2018., For starters, well be electing a new president in 2016. And Californians will be choosing another governor in 2018 when term limits finally nab Gov. Jerry Brown., Additionally, the odds are good that at least one coveted U.S. Senate seat will open up  and very possibly both of Californias. Democrats captured them in 1992 and have held on for nearly a quarter-century., Sen. Barbara Boxers term expires in 2016. And she is showing no sign of running for reelection. Shes mum publicly, but speaking loudly  many politicos believe  by not raising any money for a campaign. She has only about $150,000 banked for an effort that could cost tens of millions., In 2016, Boxer will be 75 and have suffered for two years as an oppressed member of the Senate minority., Sen. Dianne Feinstein will be up for reelection in 2018 at age 85. After many years exercising great influence, she also was relegated to minority party status last week. Will she really want to be traipsing all over California fighting for another term that would last into her 90s? Not likely., With both senators, it may depend on whether theres some impatient, ambitious Democrat out there bold enough to jump into the ring and challenge them. Would they face a grueling race or a cakewalk?, We can dismiss the notion of a Republican coming off the bench and running competitively for either governor or the Senate in this deep blue state. There isnt really a bench., So the next California governor and senators are likely again to be Democrats. But who? Heres the consensus list:,  State Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, 50, a former San Francisco district attorney., Harris gets rapped by Sacramento insiders for being overly cautious and not taking full advantage of her high-profile office  for not exhibiting more leadership., Examples: Shes an ardent death penalty opponent but took no position on a 2012 ballot initiative that would have abolished capital punishment. It failed. This year, she didnt speak up about a landmark measure to greatly reduce penalties for narcotics and property crimes. It passed., Harris explanation was that its the attorney generals duty to write the ballot summary for each proposition. Taking a position, she says, could lead to accusations of bias. But that seems lame. Shes the states top cop, after all, and should be advising voters on complex criminal justice issues., She has led on other matters, however, including gun control and relief for homeowners victimized by improper bank foreclosures. Harris record is basically positive., Her reelection was a breeze and she really didnt need to spend $1.5 million on Los Angeles TV ads. The fact Harris did told political pros that she was increasing her name ID in Southern California to prepare for a future gubernatorial or Senate bid., She would be Californias first female and first black governor., But the best bet: Boxer will retire and Harris will run for her Senate seat in 2016. She seems more suited for that collegial, broad-focused office.,  Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, 47, a former San Francisco mayor., Theres nothing shy about him. As mayor, he led the same-sex marriage movement, defying state law and issuing licenses. In the powerless job of lieutenant governor, Newsom angered Brown by writing his own sensible economic growth plan, but backed off promoting it when the governor kept casting dirty looks. He also has questioned the wisdom of Browns bullet train., Looking ahead, Newsom will be speaking out on two issues that should attract young voters. He favors marijuana legalization and strongly opposes the University of Californias plan to resume hefty tuition increases., Newsom tried to run for governor once, but got shoved aside by Brown. He clearly savors the job and, as a former mayor, prefers the executive branch to the legislative., He and Harris wont be running against each other. Bet on that. They share similar geographical, ideological and fundraising bases. Look for Newsom to run for governor in 2018.,  Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, 61, an ex-Assembly speaker. Hed love to be governor, but also would run for the Senate. Whatevers available. Hes charismatic. And if the only Latino in a race, hed have a shot.,  Mayor Eric Garcetti, 43. Hes a potential governor, depending on his mayoral performance. The timing is lousy, however. Hed have to win reelection in 2017, then immediately start running toward Sacramento. L.A. voters might not take kindly.,  Also add to the list state Controller John Chiang, 52, who was just elected treasurer. And State Sen. Alex Padilla, 41, the secretary of state-elect. Their noses are pressed against the window.,  And Brown. Would he run for Feinsteins seat as his term expired? He tried for the Senate once and lost. Hell be 80 in 2018, but with him anythings possible., Anything? How about running for president in 2016  for the fourth time  if Hillary Rodham Clinton doesnt?

{"Content": "[[, Hes been described as the \"Buddhist Bin Laden,\" but Ashin Wirathu thinks he has more in common with the worlds most famous fictional spy., \"James Bond is a nationalist,\" the cherub-faced monk said in a recent interview. Flashing a smile, he offered a vague recollection of a movie in which 007, in order to extract information from a woman, took her to bed., \"While he did not take much pleasure in the act,\" Wirathu said, \"he did it for his country.\", His questionable reading of Bond aside, the firebrand Wirathu firmly says he is defending Myanmar against the people he views as the countrys main enemy: its Muslims., Wirathu, 46, might bear as much responsibility as any individual for the desperate exodus of Muslims from Myanmar aboard overcrowded fishing boats bound for Thailand and Malaysia., In speeches and Facebook posts, he has warned of an impending \"jihad\" against the huge Buddhist majority, spread rumors of Muslims systematically raping Buddhist women and called for boycotts of Muslim-owned businesses. Good Buddhists, he argues, shouldnt mix socially with Muslims, who he says are \"snakes\" and \"mad dogs.\", \"Most Muslims destroy our country, our people and the Buddhist religion,\" Wirathu said., He represents the blunt edge of systematic religious discrimination in Myanmar that has driven about 1 million Rohingyas, a Muslim minority group, to the farthest margins of society., Human rights groups say Wirathu and the radical movement he leads, called 969, stoked sectarian riots that have killed scores since 2012. About 100,000 Rohingyas have been forced into internment camps ridden with disease and malnutrition in the western state of Rakhine, deprived of outside assistance since the government expelled foreign aid groups in 2014., Wirathus militant Buddhist nationalism is fed by official propaganda that portrays the Rohingya as people from Bangladesh who entered Myanmar illegally and have encroached on native lands, although many Rohingya families have lived in Myanmar for generations. Government policies deny the Rohingya citizenship or the right to vote and subject them to severe restrictions on movement, marriage and procreation., \"Wirathu plays a central role with his hate speech and the Islamophobia that it creates, given that the Rohingya are surrounded by a hostile community that can be whipped into violence very quickly,\" said Penny Green, director of the International State Crime Initiative at Queen Mary University of London and author of a forthcoming report on Myanmar., \"Why are these people leaving on boats? Why would people risk certain death on the high seas? Because the existence they have, and the lack of a future, is worse.\", This fall, Myanmar, also known as Burma, will hold its first nationwide elections since five decades of military rule ended in 2011. The Obama administration eased major economic sanctions in 2012 and has broadly viewed Myanmar as a diplomatic success story., But the Myanmar governments treatment of the Rohingya has cast a heavy shadow over the democratic transition., It is difficult to see how Muslims, or any group, could pose a threat to Myanmars dominant religion. In this country of 51 million, 9 of 10 people are Buddhist. The Rohingya are believed to account for barely 2%, though exact figures arent known because they were excluded from last years national census., Wirathu offers scant evidence for his claims, saying only that he reviews websites each morning and receives reports \"directly from the people.\" Yet his rhetoric has built support for government policies that critics compare to those of apartheid-era South Africa., The parliament is considering a package of laws that would regulate interfaith marriages and require government approval to change religions, thus feeding into Wirathus narrative that Muslims are trying to coerce Buddhist women into converting to Islam. He vocally supported a law that obliges women to wait three years between having children because it would \"stop the Bengalis,\" a derogatory term for the Rohingya., The Obama administration and human rights groups have called the law  which President Thein Sein approved last week, according to state-run media which parliament approved this month, an assault on womens rights and warned that it could be used to target minority groups., By the end of the month, the Rohingya must surrender the temporary \"white cards\" that constitute their only official identification, which will make it all but impossible for most to move between villages, start a small business or attend school., \"Freedom of movement is very important,\" said Shwe Maung, one of only two ethnic Rohingya members of parliament. \"No movement means no business, no chance for a better life, no money. People will become more and more vulnerable, and want to escape.\", Wirathus venomous tirades are at odds with the common Western conception of a Buddhist monk: a gentle, saffron-robed ascetic in the mold of the Dalai Lama., In a nearly two-hour meeting with three journalists from The Times at the home of one of his associates in Yangon, he was genial and relaxed, snacking on yogurt and fruit as young male aides orbited around him, but his demeanor soured when the subject turned to Islam., \"I read the Koran,\" he said, his eyes narrowing. \"To tell you the truth, I didnt find anything I liked.\", Wirathu served eight years in prison on charges of inciting religious violence, and was released in 2011 under a general amnesty. Since then, while the interim government cracks down on journalists and student protesters, Wirathu has been allowed to spread his message freely across the country, often with police officers sent in to clear the roads for his arrival., In July, after Wirathu wrote in a Facebook post that two Muslim brothers had raped their Buddhist maid in Mandalay, the second-largest city, an organized mob rampaged through Muslim neighborhoods. Two Muslims were killed. The maid later confessed to fabricating her story, but the swiftness of the violence and the fact that hundreds of riot police officers did not intervene led many to believe that it had been orchestrated., Justice Trust, a U.S.-based human rights group, said in a March report that \"almost every major outbreak of communal violence since October 2012  has been preceded by a 969-sponsored preaching tour in the area, usually by Wirathu himself.\", Powerful politicians frequently visit Wirathu at his monastery in Mandalay, leading to speculation that hard-liners from the former military government are backing him secretly. As ex-military leaders try to remodel themselves into a political party  and fend off an opposition led by democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi in the upcoming elections  analysts say Wirathus message serves conservative forces well., \"Nothing is better for them than to get the country focused not on the failures of the government to move toward democracy, but on the threat to the countrys dominant religion,\" said Roger Normand, founder of Justice Trust., Wirathu denies links to the government or advocating mob violence, saying the attacks in Mandalay were \"a setup by the Muslims so the world would see me as a terrorist.\", \"I dont work based on grudges.

{"Content": "[[, High school students have their hands full worrying about passing core math, science and English classes to graduate. In Arizona, a new requirement has been added to their load, a civics test with questions like this one: Who was president during the Great Depression and World War II?, Beginning in the 2016-17 school year, students must pass the equivalent of the U.S. citizenship test to achieve their high school diploma under a new law the Republican-controlled state Legislature approved. The first such law in the nation was supported by all 53 Republicans in the state House and Senate and 10 of 27 Democrats. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, who had called for the bill to be the first measure to hit his desk, signed it into law Thursday., To pass, high school students must correctly answer at least 60% of the 100 questions from the civics portion of the exam that new immigrants take. The test includes questions about basic U.S. history matters such as the Revolutionary War and the Founding Fathers, powers and rights as defined by the Constitution, and American political figures., QUIZ: Questions from Arizonas civics test for high school students, We are asserting and promoting the idea that our high school students should at a minimum be able to pass the test that immigrants must also pass, said Frank Riggs, president and chief executive of the Scottsdale-based Joe Foss Institute, which has been pushing for the testing requirement around the country., It is a common-sense thing to have a base line for everyone, the former congressman from California and unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate in Arizona said Friday., The institute  which is named for the former governor of South Dakota who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his service as a World War II pilot  is hoping to persuade all states to adopt the same requirement by 2017, the 230th anniversary of the U.S. Constitution. It said 15 states were expected to consider the measure this year, including North Dakota, Utah and Louisiana., Riggs, who ran a sharply conservative campaign in his governors bid last year, said the testing campaign is part of the institutes long-standing mission to spread education and freedom., We have strong conservative backing, there is no question about that, Riggs said of the testing initiative. But he pointed to the bipartisan coalition that helped pass the measure in Arizona, including prominent Democrats., He said he didnt see how anyone could possibly assert that young people should not have a basic knowledge of government., There is no higher priority for secondary education than fundamental knowledge, no greater responsibility of the taxpayer-funded system than to insure there are informed, active and engaged citizens leaving our high schools, Riggs said., Some Democrats did not quite agree, said state Sen. Steve Farley (D-Tucson), the assistant minority leader., For those opponents the issue isnt so much the content of what is being taught, but other factors such as the rush by Republicans to get the measure passed even in the face of other educational needs., The biggest problem with this thing is that nothing is said about dealing with our educational funding crisis, Farley told The Times. It was brought up as an emergency measure and was pushed through in one day. Thats not how a bill becomes a law. Bills take a longer time so they can be carefully studied and not be half-baked., Farley also said it was ironic that conservative lawmakers, who generally oppose federal testing, embraced a civics testing program that is based on questions used by the federal government for determining immigrants qualifications., This was rushed to the governor to be more of a political talking point than a policy, he said., Ducey strongly backed the bill., These are our children, and not long from now, it will be for them to vote on who sits in your chairs and who stands at this podium, Ducey said in his State of the State address Monday. How can we expect them to protect the principles on which this country was founded, if we are not preparing them for that task right now?, The academic argument for civics education also holds that a better-informed electorate will eventually be better for democracy., A 2010 Harvard study by Jennifer Bachner found that students who completed a year of course work in American government/civics are 3 to 6 percentage points more likely to vote in an election following high school than those without exposure to civics education., Farley said that during the debate over the testing bill, he had pushed for an amendment requiring lawmakers to take the same test they were requiring high school students to pass., That amendment failed, he said., michael.muskal@latimes.com, Twitter: @latimesmuskal, , , 4:32 p.m.: This report has been revised throughout for additional details and updates., This was orginally posted at1:21 p.m.]", "Date": "20150116", "Title": "[Arizona swiftly adopts law mandating high school civics test ]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-arizona-civics-test-citizenship-20150116-story.html", "Author": "[Michael Muskal]"}
{"Content": "[[, Hillary Rodham Clinton cast herself as a fighter for Americans who have yet to share in the nations economic recovery, drawing inspiration from a Democratic icon as well as her own roots in public service Saturday as she launched a new phase of her second bid for the White House., Speaking in a park dedicated to Franklin D. Roosevelt, on an island in New Yorks East River that offered sweeping views of the Manhattan skyline, Clinton said that FDRs legacy had inspired both President Obamas and her husband Bill Clintons administrations, and generations of families, including her own., Today, while the nation is \"standing again\" after the Great Recession, \"we all know were not yet running the way America should,\" she said, blaming the problems on Republicans \"trickle-down\" approach., Hilllary Rodham Clinton hails new era of prosperity., Hilllary Rodham Clinton hails new era of prosperity., Clinton sought to tap into the countrys still-nagging economic anxieties and the rising populism within her own party, declaring that the \"time has come\" for middle-class Americans who have wondered when their hard work would pay off., \"Prosperity cant be just for CEOs and hedge fund managers. Democracy cant be just for billionaires and corporations,\" she said. \"You brought our country back. Now its time, your time, to secure our gains and move ahead. And you know what? America cant succeed unless you succeed.\", The Republican \"choir,\" she said, had some \"new voices,\" but all of them were \"singing the same old song: a song called Yesterday.\", The line served both as an accusation that Republicans would return to the policies that Democrats blame for bringing about the financial crisis of 2008 and as a rejoinder to those in the GOP who have dubbed her a candidate of the past, seeking to run for a third Obama term., On issues such as climate change, economic fairness, immigration and equal rights for gays and lesbians, Clinton said it was Republicans who were out of step with the public., \"Fundamentally they reject what it takes to build an inclusive economy,\" she said. \"It takes an inclusive society -- what I once called a village -- that has a place for everyone,\" she said., She also offered a personal qualification, drawing loud applause when she reminded the crowd that while she might not be the youngest candidate in the race, she would be \"the youngest woman president in the history of the United States.\", Clinton used the high-profile speech to highlight other biographical details her campaign advisors believe many Americans continue to be unfamiliar with., Her vision of America was not one she learned from politics, she said, but from her family, specifically her late mother, Dorothy Rodham. Abandoned as a young child, her mother survived and was an example of the importance ofperseverance and hard work in the face of adversity, Clinton said., My mother taught me that everyone needs a chance and a champion. She knew what it was like not to have either one, she said., But, she added, her mothers life story also was a lesson in how simple acts of kindness -- a teacher bringing in extra food for lunch after seeing she had none, or an employer giving her time to pursue her education -- could make a difference in others lives., Because some people believed in her, she believed in me, she said., Clinton did not shy away from those characteristics that Americans are far more familiar with, including her status as a longtime target of Republican attacks., She vowed to seek partners in both parties to advance her vision, but emphasized her reputation for tenacity., \"Ill also stand my ground when I must, she said. \"Ive been called many things by many people. Quitter is not one of them., Republicans jabbed back. Clintons speech was \"chock full of hypocritical attacks, partisan rhetoric and ideas from the past,\" said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Allison Moore., Clinton launched her candidacy with an online video in April, as she had done when she began her first campaign in 2007. But she never did then what she did Saturday: hold a formal public campaign rally in which she could offer a more expansive rationale for a second Clinton presidency., Her new campaign team is largely composed of people who were not part of the last effort, but who have closely studied the mistakes that cost Clinton the nomination then, at a time when she was also the partys presumed front-runner., Thats not to say her new campaign has completely avoided pitfalls. Shes drawn criticism for taking only a handful of questions from reporters at tightly managed events in early nominating states. Questions about donations to the Clinton Foundation and her use of a private email server while secretary of State also competed for attention in the first weeks after she first announced her candidacy., While she remains the overwhelming favorite to win the Democratic nomination, enthusiasm for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders among progressive activists has illustrated the unease some of the partys core supporters have over her candidacy., Advisors bristle at the notion that Saturdays rally was part of an effort to reboot the still-young campaign, but said it was the start of a new phase of the campaign where shell begin to offer more details on the kind of presidency she envisions. Aides say that in coming weeks, shell continue to hold small-scale events, but mix in more public rallies and weekly policy addresses., Campaign officials said that Saturdays event was also a key moment in building the massive infrastructure needed to turn out Clinton supporters in the primaries and ultimately in the general election. The campaign says it is now organized in each of the nations 435 congressional districts, and Clinton will address her grass-roots team at a meeting in Iowa on Saturday night that will be simulcast at similar gatherings across the country., The campaign also launched its text-messaging program, offering those who signed up a reply with the viral photo of Clinton screening her BlackBerry messages., The Obama team excelled at building this type of infrastructure in 2008, a key to his success in amassing the delegates needed to defeat Clinton. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said Friday that this type of engagement is all the more important as voters tune out paid advertising on the ever-more-crowded airwaves, saying this election would be the \"cycle of the activist.\", Follow @mikememoli on Twitter for more 2016 campaign news., 11:24 a.m.: This post has been updated with additional remarks from the candidate and Republican response., This post was originally published at 10:50 a.m., , ]", "Date": "20150613", "Title": "[Hillary Clinton portrays herself as a fighter at kickoff rally]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-pn-hillary-clinton-rally-20150613-story.html", "Author": "[Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, Hillary Rodham Clinton does not look as if she is having fun. No matter what message she wants to deliver, reporters insist on peppering her with questions about her email server and, if not her email, then what she thinks of Donald Trump., David Horsey / Los Angeles Times, David Horsey / Los Angeles Times, With congressional investigations droning on and the conservative media chewing on the issue like a pack of pit bulls, the brouhaha inspired by Clintons handling of her public and private email during her service as secretary of State threatens to be a nagging distraction throughout the presidential campaign. Not unlike the kerfuffle over the firing of a few White House travel office employees in the opening months of Bill Clintons first term as president  Travelgate!  the email controversy falls far short of high crimes and misdemeanors once you dig into the details, but the murk of tedious technical issues and bureaucratic rules and regulations just enables those on the right who have built themselves lucrative careers by concocting lurid conspiracy theories about the Clintons. They do not have to prove anything, they only have to raise doubts in the minds of voters who do not take the time to separate facts from aggressively partisan gasbaggery., The latest to join this game is Meghan McCain, Arizona Sen. John McCains daughter. Using her dads fame and the lovely blond hair she inherited from her mother, the young McCain has turned herself into what is vaguely described as a media personality. McCain is a more zaftig version of the many interchangeable blond hotties that Fox News impresario Roger Ailes has assembled to deliver the Republican spin on his cable channel. No surprise then that McCain appeared on Fox last Wednesday to opine that the Clinton email server problem could be our generations Watergate. McCain also offered a harsh assessment of the attire the former first lady chose to wear at her most recent news conference. \"She looks like shes in a prison jumpsuit, McCain said. Its all orange., Hillary Clinton knows something about Watergate; she was a junior member of the House Judiciary Committees legal staff that conducted the impeachment probe of President Richard Nixon. She also knows that she will forever be the target of enemies who want to ensnare her and Bill in a Watergate-level scandal. The closest these Clinton antagonists have come to success was when they uncoveredMonica Lewinskys semen-stained blue dress. That led to Bill Clintons impeachment, but also to the voters pummeling Republican congressional candidates for their overreach., The majority of voters have never bought into the scandalmongering. Like Bill, Hillary can get the best of her foes simply by winning an election, even if she cannot get rid of them., One plus for the Clinton campaign, so far, is that Bill has not created any problems for his wife. The revelation of a phone call between him and Donald Trump was the only recent event that got him into the headlines. In the call, supposedly, Bill encouraged Donald to run for the Republican presidential nomination. If that is true, he did Hillary a favor. The GOP contest has been wildly disrupted ever since Trump entered the race and shot to frontrunner status., And, although comedians and cartoonists cannot resist making suggestive jokes about Bills randy past  as I have done with todays cartoon  it is likely that the Clintonian bimbo eruptions have gone dormant. These days, the ex-president appears not to have the energy for chasing skirts, even if the interest is still there. The guy looks distinctly older and, in interviews, comes across as less sharp and quick than in 2008 when he made what was, arguably, the best speech at the Democratic National Convention., The biggest challenge Hillary may face in the 2016 campaign may not be explaining her email habits nor tolerating catty comments about her colorful wardrobe. The biggest task may be to fight off the perception that, far from being the young couple who took the country by storm in 1992, the Clintons are starting to show their age.]", "Date": "20150824", "Title": "[After 23 years, scandalmongers still torment Hillary Clinton]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/topoftheticket/la-na-tt-scandalmongers-torment-hillary-20150823-story.html", "Author": "[David Horsey]"}
{"Content": "[[, Hillary Rodham Clinton had been to town the night before to energize voters, and just that morning another good report on the economy had been released in Washington. But as Jay Johnson emptied cardboard boxes into a trash bin outside Ace Hardware  hes the guy you see about tools  he had little to say about either one., Hell vote Tuesday. Probably. But if he does, this two-time Obama voter, a Democrat, says hes leaning toward Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst, not her Democratic opponent, Bruce Braley, because \"being from here, you can kind of relate to Joni.\" Beyond that, he doesnt think that anything that occurs Tuesday in the national midterm elections will affect what still matters most to him, six years after the crash: the economy., \"They say its good  that it has turned around,\" Johnson said, as he shifted one flattened box after another from a shopping cart into the bin. \"I guess most people just dont feel it.\", Johnson, 37, recently lost his second job as a carpenter at a nonprofit that helps rehabilitate houses for first-time buyers. Things were good for a while; they were doing 10 to 15 houses a month, but then the groups money dried up. His wife, a foreclosure counselor, is swamped: \"She has a lot of job security.\", Continuing unease about the economy and disappointment in the president remain the strongest head winds for Democrats across the country in Tuesdays election. Sentiments like Johnsons are why Republicans are within reach of taking over the Senate, possibly even picking up a seat here in the state with an increasingly blue tinge that launched Barack Obama on his path to the White House in 2008, and voted to elect him twice., Voters in Iowa and other closely contested states like Colorado and Louisiana say trauma from the nations economic decline is foremost in mind as the election nears. Prosperity has returned for some, but not all, and many live in fear that any gains they achieve will vanish. Undergirding their uncertainty is the discomfiting sense that no one  not the president nor members of Congress  has much control over events around the world., Each week leading up to the election seemed to bring a new crisis: Islamic militants beheading Americans, a dreaded virus finding its way to American shores, a troubled man scrambling into the White House before being stopped. And there is a palpable distrust of governments ability to handle those situations and keep Americans secure., But that unease is playing out differently among different groups of voters. Some plan to sit out the election despite the get-out-the-vote armies from the two parties and outside groups deploying across the swing states to coax sporadic voters to the polls., Yet among hard partisans on the right and left, it seems to be having the opposite affect driving them to cast ballots early, most often for what amounts to an up-or-down vote on Obama., Here in Iowa, Suzanne Ortiz, 54, said she voted early for Braley because she fears Republican control of the Senate would lead to a stripping-away of the safety net and evisceration of the new healthcare law., \"We lost everything,\" said Ortiz, a former 911 operator who said she and her engineer husband were forced to rely on Medicaid and food stamps after the economic collapse. When her husbands work picked up after two years of unemployment, they found their income was too high to qualify for help, but because of health problems, Ortiz said, \"no insurance company would touch\" her. Now they are both covered by Obamacare, and their sons are moving beyond minimum-wage jobs to a place \"where they finally can keep their head above water.\", If Republicans control both houses of Congress, Ortiz said, shes afraid \"that everything goes back to where we were.\", \"At least now we can pay the bills,\" she said. \"Maybe not on time, but we can pay them.\", Feeling that same uncertainty  but emerging on the other end of the electoral spectrum  were Wayne and Karen Gray, retired farmers who came to hear Ernst over breakfast at Big T Maid-Rite, a Toledo, Iowa, diner, during Ernsts recent swing through in an RV emblazoned with the encouragement to \"Honk if you think Washingtons broken.\", \"Its a disaster  this Ebola mess  we just dont have any leadership right now,\" said Karen Gray, 74, of Tama, who described the Obama administration as \"very reactive\" on issues from Ebola to terrorism., She and her husband both felt reassured by Ernsts promise to bring \"Iowa ways\" to Washington, and the part of her talk when she noted that she had served in Kuwait and southern Iraq with the Iowa Army National Guard. \"We could have kept ISIS from spreading,\" Ernst told the crowd at the Maid-Rite, chiding Obamas early description of Islamic State militants as a \"junior varsity\" force., \"We just want everything back to normal, for our grandchildren,\" Gray said. \"Everything she says is exactly how we feel inside about what is going on in our country.\", But the sharp partisan divide over who is to blame for those feelings of instability is driving away other voters, like 30-year-old Leo Yerington of Davenport. In his telling the fear-mongering  whether about threats to Social Security and abortion rights by the left or hysteria about Ebola patients and terrorists coming across the border from the right  has led him to tune out the election., \"You cant blame it all totally\" on the president, said Yerington, a crane operator who voted for Obama in 2008, but \"didnt like what he did.\" He is frustrated by the dearth of ideas from Ernst and Braley on how to handle those problems, adding that the Senate campaigns had amounted to \"more bashing than anything else.\", \"I cant stand that,\" he said, as he unloaded groceries while his children clambered inside the familys SUV. \"Neither one of them can hit me in the middle.\", Kelly Roth, a hairdresser who is also worried that America is losing its influence over events abroad, said she too was unlikely to turn out Tuesday because the Senate candidates had offered \"no clarity about what they would do\" to address unsettling events around the world., Roth, who was shopping the crafts aisle at a Wal-Mart in Delaware County  which split in 2012, with 49.4% for Obama and 49.6% for Mitt Romney  voted for Obama twice. \"He talked a really good talk,\" she said, but shes disappointed. While the economy has stabilized, she says many people she knows \"still want better-paying jobs.\" And she has been disgusted by candidates feeding on fears about terrorism and Ebola  helped along by \"media that likes to scare the crap out of people.\", Even at the Hamburg Inn No. 2 diner in Iowa City, a perennial stop of political candidates from Ronald Reagan to Bill Clinton in one of Iowas bluest counties, the relentless get-out-the-vote efforts here didnt motivate waitress Heather Molyneux to register (though she didnt admit that to Hillary Clinton when the potential 2016 candidate popped in for a chocolate bourbon pecan pie shake with Braley on Wednesday)., \"Really, theyre both so extreme,\" she said of the two major parties, \"that I just cant really thumb down one way or the other.\", \"Why cant I have a gun and get an abortion?\" she asked, adding that she would never want an abortion, but that people should \"make their own choices.\" As she sat at the counter during a break, she predicted that Tuesdays outcome would have little impact on her life., \"Im just getting by, by the seat of my pants. I live check to check, but the checks seem to be making do,\" said Molyneux, who has a 6-year-old son.

{"Content": "[[, Hillary Rodham Clinton has a third underdog challenger for the Democratic presidential nomination., Former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee entered the race Wednesday, casting himself as an antiwar candidate who opposed the invasion of Iraq back when Clinton supported it., We must deliberately and carefully extricate ourselves from expensive wars, Chafee told a half-full law school classroom at George Mason University in northern Virginia. We need to be very smart in these voluble times overseas., He said, Today Im formally entering the race for the Democratic nomination for president., With his announcement, Chafee became the biggest longshot among Clinton rivals who have a long way to go to avoid becoming historical footnotes in the 2016 campaign., Chafee, a former Republican turned independent who joined the Democratic Party two years ago, has made little effort to set up a competitive campaign operation, beyond a few visits and calls to activists in the early voting states of New Hampshire, Iowa and South Carolina., Longtime Chafee strategists and donors said they know little about his intentions  or even his rationale for running., Hes not done anything other than posture on some issues, said Mike Trainor, a former Chafee aide. The question hes going to have to answer is what credible indications can he give that he is at all ready to run a national campaign., Clinton has set a goal of raising $100 million for her primary bid. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who entered the race last week, has said hes already raised at least $4 million. And allies of former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley have established a super-PAC to support his efforts., All three have begun building robust campaign operations with staff across the country, a step Chafee has yet to take. He has, however, set up a campaign websitethat outlines his positions., In previous campaigns, Chafee has spent significant sums from his family fortune to further his political ambitions, for example dropping $1.8 million on his 2010 governors race. Running for president is significantly more expensive than seeking statewide office, with some pegging the estimated cost of a successful 2016 campaign at more than $1 billion., The other Democratic challengers have focused on pocketbook issues. Chafee says a strong middle class is vital, as is affordable healthcare and improved schools and public transportation., Chafee is underscoring his foreign policy stance. His opposition to Clinton, Chafee said, is driven by the belief that the next president should not be someone who supported the war in Iraq., Clinton, then a New York senator, voted to authorize the war, which became a major issue during her 2008 presidential primary campaign. Clinton now opposes putting U.S. soldiers on the ground in Iraq except as advisors to the Iraqi forces., In 2002, Chafee was a Republican and the lone GOP senator to vote against the invasion. In all, 23 of the 100 U.S. senators opposed the war then., \"I voted against the Iraq war. I knew it was based on lies,\" Chafee said in his presidential announcement. Now, he said, he is alarmed about international instability in the Middle East and in North Africa. \"Chaos ... threatens our collective future,\" he said., Chafee left the Republican Party in 2007 to become an independent and supported President Obama in both his presidential campaigns. After winning election as governor, Chafee became a Democrat in 2013 but opted against seeking reelection. His approval ratings were low., On Wednesday, he vowed to do what he believes to be right., \"I stand on my principles and I always fight for what I think is Americas long-term best interests,\" he said., Times staff writer Connie Stewart contributed to this report., ]", "Date": "20150603", "Title": "[Lincoln Chafee says he'll seek Democratic presidential nomination]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-lincoln-chafee-presidential-campaign-20150603-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, Hillary Rodham Clinton is the front-runner in the Democratic presidential primary, and Jeb Bush is a front-runner in the Republican one. And although there is a lifetime of politics between now and the next election, theres a good chance that, on Nov. 8, 2016, Americans will choose between a Bush and a Clinton for the second time in 25 years. We could have our third Bush presidency or another turn for the Clintons., To many Americans, this is troubling. Last year, former First Lady Barbara Bush said that \"there are more than two or three families that should run for high office in America.\" Sixty-nine percent of Americans agree with that statement, according to a 2014 poll from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal., This March, in another NBC News/WSJ survey, 39% of voters said they would think more or somewhat more favorably of a candidate whose last name was not Bush or Clinton. Similarly, a majority said that electing Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush would represent a return to the policies of the past., Theres no denying that the status quo  of a White House claimed by one or the other family  is unusual, and I wont criticize anyone disturbed by a pattern of \"Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama, Bush\" or \"Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama, Clinton.\", But I also dont think its as bad as it looks., Observers have called this a \"dynastic\" election. This headline from a January edition of the New York Times, is typical: \"Are Two Dynasties Our Destiny?\", \"Dynasty\" might apply to the Bush family. Indeed, Jeb Bush, in his announcement speech last Monday, described himself as \"a guy who met his first president on the day he was born and his second on the day he was brought home from the hospital,\" before declaring that \"not a one of us [presidential candidates] deserves the job by right of resume, party, seniority, family or family narrative. Its nobodys turn.\", But that term doesnt apply to the Clintons. Hillary Clinton neither came from a political family nor joined one. Instead, she entered politics as a partner to Bill, and after two decades as a political spouse, set out on her own career, first as a senator, then as a presidential candidate, then as a top diplomat, and now  again  as a presidential candidate., Given the degree to which shes built her career in tandem with her husbands, Clinton isnt a dynastic candidate as much as shes a tightly connected one., For some, of course, this is a distinction without a difference, which is why its important to note that national political dynasties are a recurring part of American life., The first father-son presidential duo, in the 19th century, was John Adams and his son, John Quincy Adams, the second and sixth presidents of the United States. The Harrison family also produced two presidents, William Henry and Benjamin. The Breckinridges dominated Kentucky politics and sent senators, House members, and a vice president to Washington. Two other antebellum presidents  John Tyler and Franklin Pierce  came from distinctly political families., The 20th century brings more familiar names: Theodore Roosevelt and his cousin Franklin Roosevelt; William Howard Taft, his son Sen. Robert A. Taft, his grandson Sen. Robert Taft Jr., and his great-grandson, former Ohio Gov. Robert Taft III. Most famously, theres the Kennedy clan., The fact that dynasties are normal  that Senate seats and governorships and presidencies have moved between and within families with ease  may be alarming (America isnt especially meritocratic) but its also mostly harmless., American democracy wasnt stronger after two Adams presidencies in quick succession, but it wasnt weaker, either. Besides, despite the frequency of dynasties, the vast majority of powerful positions in national politics go to people who arent connected to political families., One last point. George W. Bush was a very different president than his father, and if elected, Hillary Clinton will be a different president than her husband. Hillary faces a different Democratic Party than Bill did, and has to make different choices for different ends. The same is true for Jeb and the Republican Party. Their surnames aside, neither is \"more of the same.\", When you vote for president, youre voting for an administration of bureaucrats and assistants and a whole host of appointees. What matters most is the party and its network of operatives, activists, and policymakers, not the individual at the head of that party., If Clinton had won in 2008, her administration would have looked a lot like the one Obama put together. And on the same score, a Jeb Bush White House probably wouldnt look too different than a Scott Walker White House or a Marco Rubio White House., The aesthetics of another Clinton or Bush presidency dont look great. But optics have little bearing on what either candidate would do in office., Jamelle Bouie is a staff writer for Slate., Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion and Facebook]", "Date": "20150622", "Title": "[Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton: Neither would be 'more of the same']", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0622-bouie-bush-clinton-dynasties-20150622-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, Hillary Rodham Clinton knows her plan to stop big businesses from secretly funneling tranches of cash into politics may not fly with the Supreme Court and Congress, so she has a backup plan: publicly shame the companies., Clinton is embracing one of the few effective tactics for loosening the grip on big money in politics. The plan she announced Tuesday to force publicly traded companies to disclose all political giving comes as a growing chorus of academics and activists are finding new ways to expose companies that hide their political maneuvering., Many major companies are responding by coming clean. They are getting out of the game of giving so-called dark money, or funding from nonprofit groups that arent required to disclose the sources of their money. In many cases, the donations became a public relations nuisance and even a corporate liability., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, Leaks and inadvertent disclosure of how the secret money was spent already had firms rethinking the giving schemes., Companies like Google Inc.  and even Shell Oil  touting environmental awareness have been exposed supporting shadowy organizations skeptical of climate change. Insurance giant Aetna Inc., which embraced Obamacare, was discovered in an alliance with political committees seeking to sink it. And a group of major pharmaceutical companies was found to be giving big money to nonprofits trying to stop government healthcare programs from covering the contraceptives they make., These developments were arguably not good for business, and more are sure to come, regardless of whether Clinton succeeds with her plan, as advocates grow increasingly sophisticated at rooting out the political alliances that corporations are forging., \"The public has a right to know about where money comes from for campaigns, and investors have a right to know how company resources are being spent,\" said David Donnelly, president of the advocacy group Every Voice., Clintons announcement comes as the Securities and Exchange Commission is under pressure to do exactly what she is demanding., About 1.2 million individuals and groups have commented on a proposal much like Clintons. The commission has balked on acting for years amid intense opposition to the proposal from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other industry groups, which argue it is a ploy to intimidate companies from making their voices heard in government., The fight headlined a major all-day conference the chamber held in Washington in December. The organization, which spent about $35 million on political advertising in the 2014 election cycle and has taken a lead in resisting government efforts to fight climate change, does not disclose the names of its 3 million members., \"This orchestrated disclosure campaign by opponents of the business community is meant to intimidate corporations from participating in important policy debates, either directly or through trade associations and organizations such as the U.S. Chamber,\" chamber spokeswoman Blair Latoff Holmes said in an email., Those joining the chamber in pushing back against the proposal say at the very least, it is not a matter that should be decided by financial regulators., \"Supporters of this say they want what is best for shareholders, but there is lots of information at firms that shareholders do not have access to,\" said David Primo, a professor of political science and business administration at the University of Rochester in New York. \"Shareholders cannot micromanage every decision a CEO or their team makes.\", Some prominent figures in the worlds of investment and corporate governance disagree., \"The commissions inaction is inexplicable,\" said a recent comment filed by three former SEC commissioners, including Arthur Levitt, who was chairman of the agency while Bill Clinton was president. \"Its failure to act offends not only us, who are alumni of this agency struggling to retain our deep pride of association, but investors and the professionals who serve them.\", Vanguard Group founder John Bogle urged the commission to go even further than requiring disclosure of corporate giving to political nonprofits. He suggested a rule that would bar companies from giving without the approval of the owners of at least 75% of its stock., Clintons embrace of the disclosure effort highlights an approach to campaign finance reform more aggressive than that of President Obama, who has spoken out about the ills of money in politics but has not made it a focal point of his agenda., \"Clintons endorsement of this rule at the SEC is a game-changer,\" said Bruce Freed, president of the nonprofit Center for Political Accountability. \"It is now part of the conversation for 2016.\", While advocates wait for the SEC to take action, they are making headway without it. The Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at the University of Pennsylvania works with Freeds group to publish an extensive survey of corporate disclosure of political giving. It scores hundreds of companies on 24 categories, ranking them in an annual report., The survey reflects a trend in corporate America away from secret giving. The next one will be published in October., The mandatory disclosure provision may be among the most politically feasible on Clintons campaign finance reform agenda. But it is not the most ambitious. The centerpiece of her plan is rolling back the Supreme Courts Citizens United decision, which allowed corporations and unions to pour unlimited amounts into independent political committees., In a video released Tuesday, the Clinton campaign notes that the push is personal for the candidate. The conservative lobbying group at the center of the case had gone to court to gain permission to pay for the broadcast of a movie attacking Clinton., If elected president, Clintons best hope of reversing that decision would probably come through the retirement or death of one of the conservative justices on the court, whom Clinton vows she would replace with a nominee committed to overturning Citizens United., Clintons agenda also includes a new system in which the federal government would match small campaign donations. Under it, contributions made by small donors would be matched up to an unspecified, modest amount. Candidates would be eligible for such funds only if they agree to new limits on the amount they receive from any individual donor., evan.halper@latimes.com, Twitter:@evanhalper, TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>]", "Date": "20150908", "Title": "[Hillary Clinton's secret weapon in campaign finance reform: Shame]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-clinton-dark-money-20150909-story.html", "Author": "[Evan Halper]"}
{"Content": "[[, Hillary Rodham Clinton outlined a plan Monday to slash student loan interest rates while aiming to guarantee students could attend college without needing to take out loans in the first place, tapping into an issue that has risen in prominence among Democrats., Under Clintons plan, state governments, higher education institutions and students would play roles alongside the federal government in addressing the affordability of higher education and the debt that can come from it., We need to make a quality education affordable and available to everyone willing to work for it without saddling them with decades of debt, she said., The $350-billion plan Clinton outlined at a New Hampshire town hall meeting was the most expensive and expansive policy proposal of her campaign thus far. And as she tries to calibrate her approach to campaigning during a primary with a restive, liberal electorate while presenting herself as a pragmatic leader with an eye to the general election, Clinton won praise from both progressive groups and a centrist Democratic think tank that have been at odds at times., States that agree to increase spending on higher education would be eligible for federal grants to help reduce the gap between what families can afford to pay and full tuition. Families will also be required to meet what the campaign says would be a realistic contribution to tuition, and students would also be required to work 10 hours a week in return for being freed from borrowing money., We cant expect the federal government just to pay the bill for free. Thats not how America works, Clinton said., In addition, students from low-income families would also be eligible to use Pell grants to pay for room and board. The option would also be available to other students who commit to a form of public service, which could include a newly expanded AmeriCorps., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, The plan aims to give incentives to colleges and universities to control costs and assume a share of the responsibility for rising debt. A fact sheet points to a proposal co-sponsored by New Hampshires Democratic senator, Jeanne Shaheen, that would change the formula for determining eligibility for certain federal funds based on the proportion of students who are paying back loans, and require risk-sharing payments to the Department of Education for loans not being repaid., Clinton would also reduce the interest rate that the federal government charges for Stafford loans, to a point where the program would break even, rather than generate a profit to the Treasury. Students would also be able to refinance their outstanding loans at current lower rates, and future graduates would be eligible for an income-based repayment program, capping debt payments at 10% of their income., The campaign says the total cost of her proposal would be $350 billion over 10 years, with more than half of the cost going to grants for states and colleges to reduce tuition. It would be paid for by closing tax loopholes on higher earners., The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which promotes liberal policies, called the plan very big and ambitious and a sign of rising economic populist tide in American politics.\" Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank that has been a target of groups like the PCCC, also praised the plan while saying it opens up a whole new conversation on the Democratic side of the aisle, recognizing the problem goes beyond the amount of debt being accrued to the question of whether degrees are worth the cost., Sandy Baum, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who was consulted by the campaign as it drafted the plan, said there was reason to be optimistic some elements could be adopted, either as part of the debate over a new Higher Education Act reauthorization now underway in Congress, or through separate legislation., Baum cited a number of factors that have led to the explosion of student debt, starting with the severity of the Great Recession and the rise of for-profit colleges., Managing student debt is not a problem if you can get a job. But too many people havent been able to get jobs; they havent been able to get good jobs. So that makes the amount that students borrow look worse, Baum said. The most important thing we can do is strengthen the economy., Clintons leading Democratic rivals have already outlined proposals to make college more affordable., Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont has called for free tuition at public colleges and universities, at a cost of $70 billion a year., Former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley would provide for refinancing at lower interest rates and an income-based repayment plan, while requiring states to ramp up higher education spending and base tuition at a percentage of the states median income., Clintons solution to every pressing policy issue is to expand government and raise taxes, and this plan is no different, Republican spokeswoman Allison Moore said in a statement., For more campaigncoverage, follow@mikememoli, ALSO:, Trump sticks by his explanation of comment about Megyn Kelly, As GOP candidates debate, Clinton aides cheer Trump show, Bernie Sanders is drawing big crowds -- but how long will they stick around?, Aug. 10, 12:36 p.m.: This article has been updated with Clintons announcement., This article was originally published on Aug. 9 at 9 p.m.]", "Date": "20150810", "Title": "[Hillary Clinton unveils $350-billion plan to make college more affordable]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-clinton-college-affordability-20150809-story.html", "Author": "[Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, Hillary Rodham Clinton positioned herself as a crusader for voting rights Thursday, calling for an overhaul of election laws so that every citizen would automatically be registered to vote on their 18th birthday., In a speech at Texas Southern University in Houston, a historically black college, Clinton blistered Republicans, accusing them of \"systemically and deliberately\" seeking to disenfranchise voters throughout the nation with laws that make it harder to cast ballots., Calling out potential Republican rivals by name, she pointed to measures embraced by Govs. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Chris Christie of New Jersey and former Govs. Rick Perry of Texas and Jeb Bush of Florida that she said had made voting more difficult in their states., \"Republicans are systematically and deliberately trying to stop millions of Americans from voting. What part of democracy are they afraid of?\" Clinton said. The GOP, she said, needs to \"start explaining why theyre so scared of letting citizens have their say.\", Although systems similar to Clintons proposal are widely used in other countries, they would face formidable obstacles in the U.S., particularly in a Republican-controlled Congress. Republicans have long warned that Democratic-sponsored measures to expand the voting rolls would invite fraud., \"Hillary Clintons rhetoric is misleading and divisive,\" said Orlando Watson, a Republican National Committee spokesman. \"In reality, the vast majority of Americans  including minority voters  support common-sense measures to prevent voter fraud.\", Even if the measures never become law, they serve an important political purpose for the former secretary of State turned presidential candidate., Around the country, Democrats have been pushing back against Republican-sponsored state laws that they say are aimed at restricting voters. Democrats have countered with litigation in conservative states and laws in states they control that seek to expand the voter rolls., The effort to expand voting rights is particularly popular among minority voters, especially African Americans, a crucial part of the Democratic electoral coalition. If Clinton becomes the Democratic nominee, she will need a large minority turnout to win several key swing states., Clintons plan for universal voter registration is modeled after a new law in Oregon that automatically adds residents to voting rolls when they get a drivers license, unless they opt out. A law that would implement such a system in California was approved by the state Assembly in late April., Every citizen in every state in the union, everyone, every young man or young woman, should be automatically registered to vote when they turn 18, unless they choose to opt out, Clinton said after receiving the Barbara Jordan Public-Private Leadership Award, named for the late civil rights leader and congresswoman., I think this would have a profound impact on our elections and our democracy, she said., While Clinton is taking little risk politically in calling for expanded voting rights, her spotlight on the issue is notable., Democrats have pushed similar proposals before, but were unable to muster enough support in Congress, even when they controlled both houses in 2008. Some moderates in the party joined with conservatives, warning that such a system would be vulnerable to fraud., Since then, however, the issue of voting rights has become a rallying point for the Democratic Party. Republican victories in 2010 were followed by a wave of new voter restrictions in red states. Feelings about the issue have grown more intense after a Supreme Court decision two years ago struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act that had required states with a historic pattern of restricting minorities from voting to get federal approval before making changes in their election laws., Clinton ticked off new laws in some of those states that have rolled back programs to encourage voting. She suggested the Supreme Court decision made them possible and vowed to nominate justices to the court who share her view on voting rights., We should be clearing the way for more people to vote, not putting up every roadblock anyone can imagine, Clinton said., In addition to the automatic registration proposal, Clinton also called for requiring every state to provide at least 20 days of early in-person voting, saying doing so would reduce long lines at the polls and allow people who have other obligations on election day to cast ballots. About of a third of the states do not offer any early voting., If families coming out of church on Sunday are inspired to go vote, they should be free to do just that, Clinton said., Voting law experts noted that universal registration would not be considered radical in most major democracies., It is the way most elections are run in other countries, said Rick Hasen, a law professor at UC Irvine. Everyone is automatically registered by the government. It is not so crazy, if you are outside the United States., But there is little bipartisan support for such a system here, where more than a quarter of people eligible to vote are not registered. While many Democrats see expanded voting as a moral issue, practical politics are involved, too: laws that make voting difficult tend to disproportionately affect groups that typically vote for Democrats, especially low-income Americans., Experts caution, however, that the impact of changes in voting laws can be hard to gauge. In some cases, new restrictions that appear targeted at suppressing minority turnout may have the opposite effect, galvanizing voters in protest., But looking at whether turnout goes up or down immediately after voting laws are made more restrictive misses the point, said Myrna Perez, who directs the voting rights and elections program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School., \"Just because some people were upset and galvanized to go out to vote doesnt mean other people who would have voted were not blocked,\" she said., For more on the Clinton campaign, follow @EvanHalper., 3:22 p.m.: The story was updated with reaction from the Republican National Committee and comment from experts., The story was first published at 2:48 p.m.]", "Date": "20150604", "Title": "[Hillary Clinton attacks Republicans over voting restrictions]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-clinton-voting-rights-20150604-story.html", "Author": "[Evan Halper]"}
{"Content": "[[, Hillary Rodham Clinton put early childhood education at the front of her agenda Monday, pledging that as president she would work to make preschool available and affordable for every American child., Clinton, who started her career as an advocate for the Childrens Defense Fund, has long lobbied for expanding the availability of child care and preschool. At a day-care center here, she outlined proposals, including a substantial boost in federal spending to help cover the cost of schooling for 4-year-olds from low-income families., In backing expanded preschool, Clinton is advocating a policy that is popular with liberal Democrats even though some experts warn that the benefits have been oversold. President Obama rolled out a similar proposal in 2013, and Clinton said she would build on that plan if voters sent her to the White House., \"Its time we realize once and for all that investing in our children is one of the best investments our country can make,\" Clinton said, according to a transcript of her remarks released by the campaign. The event was partially closed to reporters. \"Its hard enough to pay for any preschool or child care at all, let alone the quality programs that help kids develop and flourish. Funding for these opportunities has not kept up with changing times and rising demand.\", In addition to its attraction to the liberal voters Clinton is wooing in the Democratic primaries, expanding preschool potentially has bipartisan appeal. Many states that have taken the lead in funding universal preschool have Republican governors, with Oklahoma being one of the most cited nationally., That state is \"about as red a state as you can get,\" Clinton said. \"But they have figured it out, the government and business leaders and families  that this is a smart investment for them.\", As she praised GOP governors who have expanded such programs, Clinton took a swipe at congressional Republicans who have defeated proposals for expanding federal support., \"Republicans arent just missing the boat on early childhood education, theyre trying to sink it,\" she said. \"Their budget puts at risk one of the most effective investments for our youngest children, Early Head Start.\", In their budget, \"the Republicans took care of those at the top and went after the kids,\" she said., Like Obama, Clinton pointed to research she says concludes preschool has long-enduring benefits., \"Most of us kind of intuitively have known that, but now research is telling us how much early learning in the first five years of life can impact lifelong success,\" she said., Experts are divided on how much such programs really give children a lasting jump-start in learning. Obamas claim, for example, that every dollar spent on high-quality early education would \"save more than $7 later on\" was dismissed by Russ Whitehurst, director of the Brown Center for Education Policy at Washingtons Brookings Institution. During a congressional hearing last year, he advised lawmakers when they hear that number to \"swallow with a grain of salt, or not at all.\", Whitehurst, a former Head Start official who generally supports preschool, said in a blog post that supporters of the Obama program, \"including some academics who are way out in front of what the evidence says and know it, have turned a blind eye to the mixed and conflicting nature of research findings on the impact of pre-K for 4-year-olds.\", Studies that have shown a positive effect from the publicly funded efforts generally involve intensive, committed programs that are hard to duplicate on a mass scale, skeptics say. Studies of recent efforts to expand preschool more broadly have shown some results that disappointed advocates. In some cases, the programs are simply too new to substantiate supporters claims that graduates are more likely to finish high school and be employed later in life. In other cases, the benefits of preschool appear to wear off quickly., Clinton frames the issue as one of common sense. She talks frequently on the campaign trail about working parents she meets who dont have access to high-quality programs for their children. On Monday, the parents she cited as an example were the nurses who helped deliver her granddaughter, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky. In some cases, she noted, a nurturing early childhood program can cost more than college., evan.halper@latimes.com]", "Date": "20150615", "Title": "[Hillary Clinton calls for preschool for all children]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-clinton-preschool-20150616-story.html", "Author": "[Evan Halper]"}
{"Content": "[[, Hillary Rodham Clinton stepped away from the carefully scripted stagecraft of her nascent presidential campaign Monday to engage with the press  and the questions were immediately unpleasant., The first questions asked by reporters who attended a round tablewith Clinton at a company here that manufactures furniture for small children were not about her economic policy or what she learned from talking with the factory workers. They were about the latest allegations surrounding her familys foundation., After a series of recent media reports detailing large contributions to the foundation from foreign governments seeking favor with the United States, Clinton now faces fresh allegations in a new book about the foundations connections., The candidate was dismissive of the publication, characterizing it as a hit job., We will be subjected to all kinds of distraction and attacks, she said. I am ready for that. That comes unfortunately with the territory., Clinton presided over a round tablewith workers at the company, called Whitney Bros., with the confidence of a front-runner. A newlyreleased CNN poll shows she is some 60 points ahead of the next closest likely Democratic challenger, Vermont socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders. But with a carefully honed humility,Clintonis also making good on the assurances of her campaign staff that she is taking nothing for granted., This is exactly what I want to do, hear from New Hampshire about what is on their minds, she told reporters after a discussion with company employees that touched on vocational education, child care, social security, drug abuse and other issues. I want people to know I am listening. I am accessible and I am running a campaign about them., New Hampshire has long been fond of the Clintons., It was here in 1992 that Bill Clinton coined himself the comeback kid. In the run-upto the New Hampshire primary, his campaign was flailing amid allegations of an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers. Clinton, though, endeared himself to New Hampshire voters by traveling tirelessly throughout the state, refusing to let a case of laryngitis get in the way of his nonstop talk-a-thon and charm offensive. He finished a strong second, a catalyst for Clinton to go on to capture the nomination., And it was here in New Hampshire, too, that Hillary Clinton found her footing after a very rough start in Iowa to her 2008 presidential run. The candidates political history in the state stretches back to 1968, when as student at Wellesley College she campaigned for Wisconsin Sen. Eugene McCarthy. McCarthys strong showing upended the race and factored into incumbent Lyndon Johnsons decision to later withdraw from the race altogether. By 2008, Clintons own surprise showing here revived a campaign in desperate need of a jolt., The win came after an emotional primary eve, when the polls showed Hillary Clinton down by double digits and the candidate famously impressed New Hampshire by the way she responded to a voter question about the rigors of the campaign. Seeming to choke back tears, she talked about what inspired her and showed voters a vulnerable, more human side to her personality, which resonated., Clinton is seeking to recreate some of her New Hampshire magic, built on personal interactions and the empathy the Clintons conveyed for their anxieties about the economy. But it is proving more of a challenge this time., As Clinton kicked off her New Hampshire effort Monday, the candidate could not go anywhere without being trailed by the media hordes. The lack of any serious Democratic challengers so far gives her little incentive to go off script, which means authentic moments on the campaign trail are proving infrequent., Clinton, of course, may not need them., Her arrival here was in stark contrast to visits over the weekend by the major GOP candidates, who made their pitches at a political summit. As Clinton limits her interaction with the media and carefully calibrates her time in the spotlight, Republican candidates aremaneuvering for attention. Most of them are garnering at least some by directing attacks at her., It is worth noting that Republicans seem to be talking only about me, Clinton said.

{"Content": "[[, Hillary Rodham Clinton used an economic policy speech Monday to make an early contrast with her potential Republican opponents, promising to \"rely on evidence more than ideology\" in an effort to restore financial security for Americans left behind in the recent economic recovery., Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, said that boosting middle-class wages was the \"defining economic issue of our time\" and proposed to overhaul the tax code, promote corporate profit-sharing and advance paid family leave to build what she called a \"growth and fairness economy.\", \"I want to see our economy work for the struggling, the striving and the successful,\" Clinton said in her address at the New School in New York. \"Were not going to find all the answers we need today in the playbooks of the past, we cant go back to the old policies that failed us before, nor can we just replay the successes.\", Corporate profit-sharing was an example of the \"new ideas\" Clinton said shed promote as president, saying it would give workers a stake in the success of their employer as a way to \"boost productivity and put money directly in employees pockets.\", The emphasis on profit-sharing comes amid concerns by Clinton and the many economists advising her that too much of the American economy has become focused on fast earnings for those in top income brackets, to the detriment of rank-and-file workers., Clintons speech represented the first look at what aides say will be a detailed agenda, to be rolled out in the coming weeks, that seeks to push capital toward more durable growth, creating incentives forinvestments in infrastructure and research, for example, while closing what her advisors say are tax loopholes that promote excessive risk-taking in the markets., She also promoted familiar Democratic priorities such as pay equity for women, paid family leave and affordable childcare, something she said was not a \"luxury\" but a \"growth strategy.\", Her proposals take aim at a problem vexing economists: how to pull America out of a prolonged period of stagnant middle-class wages, even at a time when productivity is on the rise., Income disparity has become a central issue in the race for the White House, and Republican candidates have ideas that differ from Clintons. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is building his economic agenda around a plan to boost growth of the countrys gross domestic product to a sustained 4% a year., Calling inequality a \"drag\" on the entire economy, Clinton targeted Bush directly for saying last week that Americans needed to \"work longer hours\" -- a portion of the former Florida governors discussion of economic solutions that his campaign said critics have taken out of context. Clinton said Bush \"must not have met very many American workers,\" and challenged him to repeat the claim to nurses, teachers and others who she said \"do not need a lecture. They need a raise.\", Discussing tax reform, Clinton called a plan from Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida that would slash taxes on top incomes a \"budget-busting giveaway to the super wealthy,\" the kind of plan that was typical of the \"bad economics\" Republicans would propose., And she attacked the newest GOP contender, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, for \"stomping on workers rights\" by seeking to undermine the strength of public employee unions., \"I will fight back against these mean-spirited, misguided attacks,\" she vowed, saying the decline of unions was responsible for a third of the increase in income inequality. \"If we want to get serious about raising incomes, we have to get serious about supporting union workers.\", The attacks on potential general election foes mirrored a recent effort by President Obama to frame the general election debate on the economy on favorable terms for the party. But Clinton also went a step further as she seeks to boost her standing with liberal Democrats animated by the economic fairness debate, promising to go beyond the Dodd-Frank financial reforms to hold Wall Street accountable for abuses that have hurt the working class., \"While institutions have paid large fines and in some cases admitted guilt, too often it has seemed that the human beings responsible get off with limited consequences or none at all, even when they have already pocketed the gains,\" she said. \"This is wrong, and on my watch it will change.\", Bushs campaign responded that Clintons speech was just a collection of \"antiquated proposals\" to \"protect the special interests that want to stifle American ingenuity.\" The campaign of one of Clintons Democratic challengers, former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley, argued that she didnt go far enough and cited his specific plans to target Wall Street in particular as an example of the \"fearless and progressive new leadership\" needed to fix Americas problems., @evanhalper, 9:24 a.m.: This story was updated with details and quotes from Clintons speech., This story was originally published at 3 a.m.]", "Date": "20150713", "Title": "[Hillary Clinton draws contrast with Republicans as she lays out economic plan]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-hillary-clinton-economy-20150713-story.html", "Author": "[Evan Halper, Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, Hillary Rodham Clinton warned Friday in her first major foreign policy speech of the 2016 presidential campaign that her potential Republican opponents would return to cowboy diplomacy and reckless warmongering, while she embraced President Obamas policy of engagement and vowed to advance normalization of ties with Cuba by ending the decades-old embargo., Though she served four years as secretary of State, Clinton has focused her campaign so far on domestic issues, primarily the economy. Her first lengthy remarks on foreign policy centered on a pivotal Obama administration decision realized only after she left the Cabinet: the reestablishment of ties with Cuba after a half-century freeze., Though it was not a decision she is closely associated with, the change in Cuba policy is one she had championed for years in the administration and now offers her a chance to embrace a policy that not only enjoys broad support among the public, but also offers a clear political contrast with Republicans., Clinton delivered the speech in Miami, home turf for Sen. Marco Rubio and just hours after sharing a stage with Floridas former governor, Jeb Bush. She acknowledged the issue of Cuba has stirred passionate debate in the city for decades, but said it was entering a new phase., Americas approach to Cuba is at a crossroads, and the upcoming presidential election will determine whether we chart a new path forward or turn back to the old ways of the past, she said. We must decide between engagement and embargo, between embracing fresh thinking and returning to Cold War deadlock., In a major shift, Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro announced in December that they would work to restore full diplomatic relations after five decades of animosity that had its roots in the Cold War. In the months since, the U.S. has removed Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism, and each country opened an embassy in the others capital this month., Many Republican lawmakers, and some Democrats, opposed the change, accusing the president of naively strengthening the hand of a regime that continues to oppress its people. But Clinton said Friday that such thinking was backwards and sided with Obamas view that direct engagement and enhanced ties ultimately best serves the Cuban people., We cant go back to cowboy diplomacy and reckless warmongering, she said. We cant go back to a go-it-alone foreign policy that views American boots on the ground as a first choice, rather than a last resort., In a statement, Bush countered that it was insulting for Clinton to come to Miami and endorse a retreat in the struggle for democracy in Cuba., Secretary Clintons call to abandon the embargo  and the principles of democracy and freedom for the Cuban people  in exchange for nothing in return from the regime in Havana adds insult to the pain they and their families feel, he said. The American people deserve principled leaders who will stand up to our adversaries and stand up for our values. Secretary Clintons politically expedient embrace of President Obamas unilateral concessions to Cuba makes clear she will do neither., A Gallup survey from February found that 59% of respondents favored ending the trade embargo against Cuba while 29% opposed it., Doing so requires the support of Congress, which appears a heavy lift, particularly with Republicans in control of both chambers. But Clinton called on House Speaker John A. Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to step up and answer the pleas of the Cuban people by bringing it to a vote., Obamas openness in the 2008 campaign to engage directly with foreign leaders without preconditions was a flash pointin the debate not only with Clinton but Republican rivals. Clinton criticized Obama at the time for saying he was open to meeting with Castro after he assumed the Cuban presidency in 2008 from his brother, Fidel., Clintons opponents, in both parties, also noted that she had supported continuing the embargo as a candidate in 2000 (for Senate) and 2008 and said she her shift was one of political expediency rather than principle. But Clinton framed the change as a pragmatic one, while for her rivals, ideology trumps evidence., I understand the skepticism in this community about any policy of engagement toward Cuba. As many of you know Ive been skeptical too, Clinton acknowledged Friday. But youve been promised progress for 50 years and we cant wait any longer for a failed policy to bear fruit., Clinton said maintaining an unfriendly policy toward Cuba was a barrier to improved relations in the hemisphere, which she said would be a major strategic advantage to the U.S. as China seeks to grow its influence around the world. She accused Republicans of having an outdated view toward Latin America, which she said was now home to vibrant democracies, expanding democracies, abundant energy supplies, and that the U.S. should use what she called the power of proximity to deepen ties., Republicans have already tied Clinton to Obamas foreign policy record, particularly on Iran. But Clinton largely embraced the shift Obama made, saying that under his leadership we learned to lead in new ways for a complex and changing age, and America is safer and stronger as a result., We cannot afford to let out-of-touch, out-of-date, partisan ideas and candidates rip away all the progress weve made, she said., For more presidential campaigncoverage, follow mikememoli]", "Date": "20150731", "Title": "[Clinton warns of 'cowboy diplomacy' if Republicans retake White House]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-fg-clinton-cuba-20150731-story.html", "Author": "[Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, Hillary Rodham Clinton was mobbed by fans when she spoke this week before a big crowd of Latino government officials from across the country. When another Democratic presidential hopeful, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, took the same stage here Friday, the room was about half-empty., \"I havent heard of him, to be honest,\" said Luciana Corrales, a school board member from San Ysidro, Calif. And anyway, she added, \"Im a Hillary supporter.\", Talk of a Sanders surge has enlivened the campaign in recent weeks, as bigger-than-expected crowds turned out for his fiery speeches about taking on the \"billionaire class\" amid promising polling in the early-primary state of New Hampshire. But the enthusiasm gap on display at the nations largest gathering of Latino policymakers highlights the reality of the major demographic challenges Sanders faces as he wages his long-shot bid for the presidency., \"His name recognition in the Latino community is somewhere in between zero and extremely low,\" said Matt Barreto, a pollster who focuses on Latino voters. \"And youre not going to win an election without Latino support.\", Nonwhite voters make up a third or more of the turnout in Democratic primaries in most states, according to exit polls. Sanders, who represents a state that is 94% white, has little experience campaigning for minority votes. That will pose a challenge as he travels to more-diverse early-voting states like Nevada, home to a large Latino population, and South Carolina, where African Americans make up roughly half of Democratic primary voters., \"If your only significant constituency is older white voters, thatll be good in Iowa and New Hampshire, but when you hit Nevada and South Carolina youre in another world,\" said Democratic strategist Bill Carrick. \"If youre going to be the nominee, youre going to have to do pretty well among Latino, African American voters, women, single women and millennials. Thats the challenge for Bernie Sanders  to become more than a niche candidate and become a candidate with a broad coalition of support.\", Sanders campaign advisors say his platform, which includes free college tuition and Medicare for all, has appeal across racial and ethnic lines. His speech Friday at the annual conference of the National Assn. of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials  his first to a Latino audience  was well-received. His pledges to raise the national minimum wage and reduce spending on jails and prisons drew standing ovations., After drawing heat from some Latino pundits in recent weeks for not talking enough about immigration, Sanders addressed the issue head-on Friday, matching Clintons pledge to go further than President Obama in shielding from deportation immigrants who are in the country illegally., A self-described socialist who has made growing class inequality the theme of his campaign, Sanders described immigration as an economic issue., \"We cannot continue to run an economy where millions are made so vulnerable because of their undocumented status,\" Sanders said, asking: \"Who benefits from this exploitation?\", In a departure for Sanders, who typically forgoes personal anecdotes for numbers-driven analysis, he paused for a moment to talk about his own experience as the son of an immigrant., \"My dad came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket,\" said Sanders., Immigration \"is the story of America, and we should be proud of that story,\" he said., His message appeared to resonate with listeners, including Andrew Rodriguez, a city councilman from Eloy, Ariz., who said he liked that Sanders \"spoke his mind.\", Still, Sanders has considerable ground to make up if he wants to be known to Latinos. In a recent CNN poll, just 5% of nonwhite Democratic voters said they were likely to support Sanders compared with 65% who backed Clinton., Clinton, who beat Obama 2 to 1 among Latino voters in the 2008 Democratic primary, has made an early and spirited pitch for Latino support this campaign cycle, laying out her immigration plan last month during a round-table discussion with young immigrant activists at a Las Vegas high school., Clinton, a former senator from New York and secretary of State, has named Latinos to top positions in her campaign. Last month she hired Lorella Praeli, a well-known \"Dreamer\" who was brought to the country illegally as a child. The campaigns political director, Amanda Renteria, arrived at the conference a day ahead of Clinton to talk up her candidate with officials gathered for several days of workshops and other events., Former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley, another candidate seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, has also emphasized Latino outreach. His second interview after he announced his candidacy last month was with the Spanish-language news channel Univision, and he has promised to act on immigration reform within the first 100 days of his presidency., Tad Devine, Sanders campaign strategist, said the candidate would be talking more to Latinos in the coming months, highlighting his record in Congress on immigration issues. The campaign is also hiring people to focus on Latino outreach and communications., Garrison Nelson, a professor of political science at the University of Vermont, said it is not Sanders natural instinct to tailor his message to different audiences., \"Bernies not an identity politics candidate,\" said Nelson, who has been following Sanders political career for decades., \"Bernies is an economic message,\" Nelson said. \"He believes the underclass is not defined by their demography; theyre defined by their income. He finds this kind of demographic politics somewhat  well, he doesnt like it.\", Sanders had a different message at an earlier campaign stop Friday morning. At a boisterous rally at Treasure Island Casino, he brought an overwhelmingly white crowd of several hundred to their feet several times with calls for a \"political revolution\" that includes limiting the money that private companies can spend in elections., He didnt mention his support for a pathway to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally until 45 minutes into his speech  and even then he only spoke a few lines., That didnt matter to 20-year-old Christian Herrera, who sat excitedly with his parents in the second row. The family had driven five hours that morning from Mexicali, Calif., to see Sanders speak., Herrera, who said he was drawn to Sanders support for free college tuition, said Latinos care about much more than just immigration. Latino issues are American issues, he said., \"Hes for the people,\" Herrera said of Sanders. \"Hes for the middle class.\", kate.linthicum@latimes.com]", "Date": "20150621", "Title": "[Bernie Sanders strives to sell his message to Latino voters in Nevada]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/immigration/la-na-democrats-latinos-20150620-story.html", "Author": "[Kate Linthicum]"}
{"Content": "[[, Hillary Rodham Clinton will enter the 2016 Democratic presidential race  finally, officially  as the most commanding front-runner in generations. Yet her path to the White House will not be easy, much less assured., For every advantage she carries an offsetting burden, along with the weight of exceedingly high expectations., Clinton is beloved and widely admired. She is also loathed and widely criticized., She boasts an unprecedented resume  former first lady, New York senator, secretary of State  and enjoys universal name recognition after more than two decades of near-constant presence on the national stage. That familiarity, however, will make it exceedingly difficult for Clinton to present herself as someone fresh and different  qualities voters often crave, especially at the tail end of a two-term presidency., After more than a year of speculation and anticipation, Clinton is expected to formally launch her campaign Sunday with a video announcement, followed by a trip to Iowa, which is set to begin the presidential balloting next winter., She is running, as yet, with little serious opposition for the Democratic nomination, which gives Clinton the chance to hew toward the political center and reach from the start for the independent and less-ideological voters needed to win a general election., But it also denies her the competition that could toughen a candidate who, nearly eight years removed from her 2008 presidential bid, seems nowhere near top fighting trim., And there are those expectations, which afford a Democratic challenger, however viable, the opportunity to show up Clinton by performing even halfway decently in an early contest; 16.5% of the Iowa vote was enough to launch Gary Hart into a serious contest against former Vice President Walter Mondale, who started 1984 as a formidable front-runner., That would present a significant heap of challenges for even a candidate as supple as Clintons husband, Bill. He was, however, a rare talent. Hillary Clinton, by contrast, has proved a much better author, celebrity, role model and discussant of public policy than political campaigner., She can be warm and engaging in small settings but dull and distant before large crowds. Her speeches are more workmanlike than uplifting. Her relations with the political press corps have been brittle even on the best days and that, in turn, has helped perpetuate a reputation for coldness and calculation., Still, one thing Clinton has repeatedly demonstrated in a long public life is tenacity and resilience., For that reason, many Democrats are convinced Clinton will be a better candidate than in 2008, when she also started as an overwhelming favorite but lost the partys nomination to President Obama, in no small part because of the air of entitlement that suffused her campaign., \"She seems ready to run for this not like a front-runner but like someone interested in earning every vote because of what she stands for and where she wants to take the country, as opposed to who she is,\" said Steve McMahon, a Democrat strategist who is supporting Clinton but not working for her campaign., It is impossible, of course, to introduce Clinton to voters as though for the first time. But in the days after her announcement, campaign strategists will place her in surroundings they hope will start to refashion some less-than-flattering perceptions., There will be no splashy rallies, arena-size appearances or major policy speeches, at least to start. Rather, Clinton will be sitting down to talk issues with voters in more intimate settings, telegraphing a message, it is hoped, of humility, empathy and approachability., It is a technique that worked when Clinton, still living in the White House and facing the inevitable charge of carpet-bagging opportunism, conducted a \"listening tour\" of New York as a prelude to her successful 2000 U.S. Senate run., \"Those are the kinds of settings where shes best,\" in good part because she enjoys herself the most in smaller, more casual encounters, said Paul Begala, who has been close to both Clintons for decades. \"Its also a good antidote to, Im rich. Im famous. Im powerful.\", (Begala, a top strategist in Bill Clintons 1992 presidential campaign and a veteran of his White House, has an advisory role with a pro-Hillary Clinton political action committee, which forbids him from direct conversations with the candidate or her campaign about strategy.), The slow ramping-up will also give Clintons fledging campaign team, currently a thrown-together mix of volunteers, staffers-in-waiting and longtime family friends, associates and retainers, a chance to impose a more formal and disciplined structure. Fundraising will be an early and important priority., That said, no election takes places in a vacuum. Matters involving the candidates personality, her presentation and the campaign process are all within the jurisdiction of Clinton and her strategists, at least to some degree. What cannot be controlled are some of the larger forces she  or any Democrat, for that matter  will face as the partys 2016 standard-bearer., Only one time in the last 65-plus years has a political party managed to string together three consecutive White House victories; the candidate who achieved that, Republican Vice President George H.W. Bush, did so in 1988 under a president, Ronald Reagan, who was more popular than Obama is today., The bias toward stability that often helps incumbents win reelection seems to yield to a hunger for change by the time a party has spent eight years in the White House., In Clintons case, it helps that she is bidding to make history as the countrys first woman president. For all her familiarity, that alone argues against the business-as-usual, more-of-the-same case that Republicans are prepared to make against her for the next many months., But there again Clinton must be careful, lest her candidacy becomes too much about her and history rather than voters more pressing and personal concerns., Clinton has enjoyed a brilliant career and her sterling past helped place her in the strong position she boasts on the brink of her announcement. But elections are inevitably about the future and Clinton will have to face resolutely forward if she hopes to move ahead and, after November 2016, into the White House., Follow  @markzbarabak fornational & California politics]", "Date": "20150410", "Title": "[Hillary Clinton will be a commanding front-runner facing high expectations]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-hillary-clinton-2016-analysis-20150410-story.html", "Author": "[Mark Z.

The two-minute production notes that the Supreme Courts decision to allow corporations and unions to pour unlimited amounts into independent political committees came in a case involving her., Citizens United, the conservative lobbying group at the center of the Supreme Court case, went to court to gain permission to pay for the broadcast of a movie attacking Clinton. It was called \"Hillary: The Movie.\", One of the things that people dont really realize is that Citizens United was actually started from a conservative organization that wanted to bring down Hillary Clintons candidacy, Kristin Schake, Clintons deputy communications director, says in the video. They didnt like who she is. They dont like what she stands for., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, Still, Clinton is in an awkward position on campaign finance. She is calling for a reversal of the courts decision, vowing to nominate justices who would uphold limits on campaign spending. She has also said she would push for a constitutional amendment if the court will not bend., We have to end the flood of secret, unaccountable money that is distorting our elections, corrupting our political system, and drowning out the voices of too many everyday Americans,\" Clinton said in a statement. \"Our democracy should be about expanding the franchise, not charging an entrance fee.\", But the candidate herself is taking advantage of the openings the court created as well as the laxity of the Federal Election Commission to raise eye-popping amounts of cash., Clinton supporters say they have no choice. Unilateral disarmament, they often say, would only assure self-destruction., The candidates proposals for changing the system are unlikely to get much traction if Republicans maintain control of at least one house of Congress, as is widely expected. The GOP has shown no interest in rolling back Citizens United., Republican officials, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, argue that the high court was right when it held that the ability to spend money in support of a candidate is a key element of free speech, protected by the Constitutions 1st Amendment., NEWSLETTER:Get the days top headlines from Times Editor Davan Maharaj >>, Republicans also have little fondness for other items on Clintons campaign finance agenda, including a new system in which the federal government would match small campaign donations., Under that plan, contributions made by small donors would be matched up to an unspecified, modest amount. Candidates would only be eligible for such funds if they agree to new limits on the amount they receive from any individual donor., Clinton also is proposing new federal rules that would require publicly traded companies to disclose to shareholders any political contributions they make. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been urging companies to resist such disclosure amid several years of pressure from shareholder activists and academics., An annual report called theCPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability ranks companies for their transparency in disclosing political donations.

{"Content": "[[, Hillary Rodham Clinton wound down her political operation in 2008 with 2.5 million email addresses in her campaign database. Seven years later, when campaign officials turned on the lights in April, they were stunned to find fewer than 100,000 still worked., Campaign aides learned the bad news in much the same way a reunion organizer trying to reconnect with old friends might, albeit on a much larger scale: an inbox clogged with bounce-back messages on the day Clinton announced her campaign and sent messages to supporters., The huge attrition of valuable data is not unique to Clinton -- a typical email list will lose 1 in 5 subscribers each year, said Jordan Cohen, chief marketing officer for Fluent, which specializes in email list acquisition. But it created one of the first big challenges for the campaigns growing digital team, has played a role in limiting Clintons fundraising so far and sparked a response that illustrates the high priority campaigns now place on acquiring digital data., It wasnt like we all had time to retreat to a local bar and drown our sorrows, said Teddy Goff, the Clinton campaigns digital director  a role he also filled for President Obamas reelection campaign. It was an instantaneous recognition on the part of a lot of us that we had a bigger challenge ahead of us than we realized., The email problems helped account for a relative paucity of small donors to Clintons campaign so far. Finance reports filed Wednesday night with the Federal Election Commission showed that fewer than one-fifth of Clintons donors had contributed $200 or less, a significantly smaller level than President Obama achieved in his two campaigns., Having a large number of small donors is crucial to Democratic campaigns to offset the significant advantage the Republicans are likely to have with big-money donors., Because Clinton so far faces only limited challenges in the Democratic primaries, her campaign still has ample time to catch up. But rebuilding the digital infrastructure has become one of the most critical goals that campaign officials set this year, prompting what became known as the Hillbuilder program., During the campaigns first all-staff meeting, on the day before Clintons public campaign launch on Roosevelt Island in June, campaign manager Robby Mook identified building the email list as one of the top three goals in the years third quarter. On the cubicle walls of the offices used by the digital staff, a sign asks: What are you doing to grow the list today?, In 2012, Obamas reelection campaign, which boasted 30 million addresses at its peak, raised $485 million  more than 40% of its total haul  through its endless, and often parodied, email appeals, according to a former campaign official who provided the internal fundraising data on condition of anonymity. The rest of the fundraising total was split equally between major donors and direct marketing through traditional mail and phone contacts., Increasingly sophisticated methods for analyzing large amounts of data have made emails more and more valuable to campaigns, and not just as a vehicle for direct communication. The ability to track a users online experience helps the campaign develop a profile that is then used to send more-targeted communications., The campaigns are looking at not just are they going to contribute $1, $10 when I send them an email, but are they opening, are they clicking, are they forwarding this email to their friends. Are they taking the email and posting it onto social, Cohen said. There is just inherent value in having engagement that will lead, hopefully, into votes., The Clinton campaigns digital handicap wasnt limited to its email lists. The former secretary of State had no Facebook page, no Instagram account and only 3.3 million Twitter followers at her launch date (President Obamas campaign-run account has more than 60 million today, by comparison)., The campaign would not disclose how much its list has grown since April. But it has reached 5 million followers across its accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Spotify and Pinterest, officials said., The campaign launched each of those platforms over the last few months, with a goal of reaching would-be supporters where they normally spend time online and creating a ripple effect that would expand their contact lists., One early, successful tactic was to create a daily, rapid-response-style newsletter that supporters could subscribe to called The Briefing, launched to coincide with a new book critical of the Clinton Foundation., The campaign also sought to build suspense around the Roosevelt Island rally by promising exclusive details about the event to those who signed up on Clintons website. And last week, Clinton emailed supporters inviting them to tell her when their birthdays are, so she  or her digital avatar, at least -- can send a note when the day arrives., Were part of a team together, the email read. Were going to work hard and have a lot of fun through it all. Part of that is taking some time to celebrate and appreciate each other, and thats what Id like to do on your birthday., The idea, Goff said, grew out of the fact  attested to by her own, now public, emails  that Clinton has always gone out of her way to offer birthday wishes to those around her. A successful digital effort, he noted, depends on the authenticity of each communication., Thats a true thing about her that reflects something that we think people are going to enjoy that can also be turned into an online program thats going to help us build our community, he said., Expanding the digital infrastructure isnt just happening organically, of course. The campaign also engaged in more transactional efforts, including exchanging active contacts with the Ready for Hillary organization. They have also already spent $2 million on an online advertising campaign that has helped add names to the list., The core of what were trying to do is serve people with an experience that theyre going to enjoy, thats going to enlighten them and hopefully inspire them to get more deeply involved in the campaign, Goff said., For more on Campaign 2016, follow @MikeMemoli, , 8:50 a.m.: This story was updated to add information from Clintons campaign donation reports., The story was originally published at 3 a.m.]", "Date": "20150716", "Title": "[Hillary Clinton's other email problem]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-hillary-clinton-digital-20150715-story.html", "Author": "[Michael A.

We cant ignore the inequalities that persist in our justice system that undermine our most deeply held values of fairness and equality., She expressed horror at the TV images of heavily armed police officers confronting protesters in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb. Nobody wants to see our streets like a war zone, Clinton said. Not in America. We are better than that., But she leavened the criticism with praise for the many decent and respectful law enforcement officers who showed what quality law enforcement looks like and lauded President Obama for dispatching Atty. Gen. Eric Holder to Ferguson as part of a thorough and speedy investigation., Clinton, the overwhelming frontrunner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, had been criticized for failing to weigh in on the events in Ferguson, where the shooting of the unarmed Brown sparked days of violent protests., The still-disputed circumstances of Browns death and the heavily armed police response to the subsequent demonstrations have sparked a nationwide debate on race and the use of police force., Most of the prospective 2016 presidential contenders have avoided comment on the events in Ferguson, or been circumspect., A notable exception was Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who broke with Republicans traditional hard line on law and order by publishing a Time magazine essay  while protesters were still in the street  mixing a condemnation of heavy-handed policing with criticism of how the justice system treats minorities., Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention, Paul wrote., More typical was the response of Republican Rep. Paul Ryan, who counseled caution before making any judgments., We should take a deep breath, sit back and let law enforcement do their job, the Wisconsin Republican said in an interview on SiriusXM during a tour to promote his new book. Let the investigation take place so that the facts can be taken as the facts, and let justice be done appropriately., In her remarks Thursday, Clinton echoed many of the sentiments that Paul expressed., \"Imagine what we would feel and what we would do if white drivers were three times as likely to be searched by police during a traffic stop as black drivers, instead of the other way around,\" she said. If white offenders received prison sentences 10 times longer than black offenders for the same crime., She urged members of the audience to look around and, considering the high rate of incarceration for black males, imagine that one-third of those attending were locked away. That is the reality, she said, of so many of our fellow Americans and so many of the communities in which they live., Clinton did not address the controversy surrounding the police release of a videotape showing Brown apparently shoplifting cigarillos before his confrontation with Officer Darren Wilson. Rather, she spoke of the emotions she felt as a mother and a human being watching Browns funeral earlier this week., My heart just broke for his family, she said, because losing a child is every parents greatest fear and an unimaginable loss., mark.barabak@latimes.com, Follow @markzbarabak for more political news and analysis]", "Date": "20140828", "Title": "[Clinton breaks silence on Ferguson, calls for fixing justice system]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-clinton-breaks-silence-on-ferguson-20140828-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, Hillary Rodham Clintonis on track to raise a record $45 million in contributions during her first quarter as a 2016 presidential candidate, building a formidable campaign fund that further solidifies her position as the prohibitive Democratic front-runner, according to numbers released by her campaign Wednesday morning., In a sign of the growing dominance of money in politics, the staggering amount of cash far exceeds what Clinton raised during her first quarter as a candidate eight years ago, when officials from her campaign reported they were ecstatic with her $26-million haul. It also dwarfs the amount her next-closest rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, is likely to raise., The fundraising quarter that ended Tuesday is traditionally used as a barometer to gauge the strength of campaigns. Clinton officials boasted that they bested the previous record for a first-quarter candidate, which was set by President Obama in 2011 as he embarked on his reelection campaign. Obama raised $41.9 million during that period., But the large bank account by no means clears the field for Clinton. Sanders, who has not yet released his fundraising figures, has enough in the bank to mount a competitive challenge in at least the early states. Earlier in the quarter, he had already raised $8 million from more than 200,000 donors. At this stage in the campaign, the number of donors can be as important as the total amount raised, as it reflects grass-roots support and enthusiasm., The Clinton campaign did not reveal how many people contributed in a background memo sent to reporters. But it noted that 91% of the contributions were $100 or less. In the final days of the quarter, the campaign had blitzed supporters with emails, imploring them to give as little as $1  a clear sign of Clintons eagerness to show broad-based interest. The pitches set a goal of 50,000 contributions., Campaign officials have said they need $100 million to win the primary. They are clearly well on their way. Should Clinton win, however, she will need ramp up her fundraising substantially. A successful general election campaign fund would likely exceed $1 billion., Much of that money wont be directed to the official campaign account, which cannot accept contributions exceeding $2,700 per donor. The funds will be sent to Clintons super PAC, which evades federal fundraising rules by operating independent of the campaign.

{"Content": "[[, Hopes for a broad overhaul of the corporate tax system are fading as the 2016 elections draw closer, but momentum is building for one key change  the U.S. tax that companies would pay on overseas profits., A bipartisan proposal, to be introduced soon in Congress, would tax the estimated $2 trillion in foreign profits held by U.S. corporations in overseas accounts, but at a much lower rate than the current 35% levy., The tax would generate tens of billions of dollars for the federal Highway Trust Fund, which will run out of money at the end of the month. Lawmakers have been in a desperate scramble to replenish the fund, which helps pay for new roads, bridges and other transportation infrastructure., The trade-off that makes the proposal attractive to business groups is that multinational corporations would end up paying little to no U.S. taxes on future foreign profits., Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who unveiled the set of international tax principles last week, didnt specify a new tax rate yet, but it is likely to be lower than the 14% that President Obama had proposed early this year., Supporters said the plan would reduce incentives for companies to reincorporate overseas, a controversial tax-reducing tactic known as inversion that has drawn the ire of Democrats., \"Our international tax system is upside down and inside out. It creates incentives to send jobs and stash profits overseas, rather than creating jobs and economic growth here in the United States,\" Schumer said., \"These proposals would right the ship, provide a potential funding source for transportation reauthorization and allow the United States to compete on a level playing field,\" he said., For companies to bring home overseas profits, they must pay corporate taxes at the U.S. rate of 35%  the highest among advanced economies  minus whatever tax was paid in the country where the money was earned., Most other advanced economies simply require companies to pay the taxes due wherever the money was earned, with little or no additional taxes levied to bring the money home., And as part of the U.S. transition from its current worldwide taxing system to a so-called international system, Portman and Schumer have proposed a \"one-time transition toll charge\" on existing foreign earnings., The tax would be levied regardless of whether the money is brought back to the U.S., a process known as repatriation. All foreign earnings now sitting offshore would be deemed to be repatriated even if they remained overseas., Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he welcomed the plan from Portman and Schumer., \"These ideas could serve as the basis for a bipartisan package to stem the tide of inversions and takeovers ... and potentially unlock a solution to our Highway Trust Fund shortfall,\" he said., The funds primary funding source is a federal tax on gasoline and diesel fuel. But the amount, 18.4 cents a gallon, hasnt been increased since 1993. And as vehicles have become more fuel efficient, the fund has developed shortfalls. Spending is expected to exceed revenue by about $167 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office., Many Democrats want to raise the gas tax to pay for the fund. But congressional Republican leaders oppose a tax increase., With bipartisan support for continued highway and infrastructure spending, anything that could provide the funding becomes attractive., \"In a perfect world, you wouldnt tie tax reform to the Highway Trust Fund,\" said Curtis S. Dubay, a tax expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation. But lawmakers see the need to find highway funding \"as a forcing mechanism to get something done\" on international taxes., The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and National Assn. of Manufacturers have said they opposed a forced repatriation of foreign earnings simply to replenish the Highway Trust Fund., But including it as part of a shift from the current international tax system  a move that would reduce corporate tax bills over the long term  changes the equation, said Dorothy Coleman, who handles tax policy for the manufacturers group., \"We understand that weve got a lot of assets overseas that have not been taxed and that some kind of transition from one system to another will be part of a tax reform effort,\" she said. \"The details are going to be very important to us.\", One crucial detail is the tax rate on foreign earnings. Obama wants a 14% rate, and Portman would like to see a much lower rate. Business groups also would like to see money they use for factories and other fixed assets taxed at a lower rate than uninvested profits, Coleman said., \"Some of our members have earned money overseas and have reinvested it in facilities and factories  to service local customers so they would have to come up with cash to pay a tax bill they had not anticipated,\" she said., Those details might not come until the fall, because Portman and Schumer still must draft legislation. Lawmakers could find a short-term source for highway money, as theyve done twice since last summer, that would keep the trust fund afloat for a few months to provide time for a detailed tax plan., Still, business groups want changes to the international tax system to be made as part of a broader overhaul that includes lowering the corporate tax rate for domestic earnings as well. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has indicated that he prefers a comprehensive tax overhaul., Some key lawmakers, however, have been trying to push broad business tax changes for a few years with no success., So an international tax shift, spurred by the need for highway funding money, has \"a real shot at potential enactment at year-end as the foundation of any large highway bill,\" said Chris Krueger, a policy analyst at financial services firm Guggenheim Partners., jim.puzzanghera@latimes.com]", "Date": "20150714", "Title": "[Bipartisan support grows for corporate tax change tied to Highway Trust Fund ]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-corporate-tax-plan-20150714-story.html", "Author": "[Jim Puzzanghera]"}

The GOP was also expected to bolster its numbers in the House by a small number of seats., President Obama, who has been of little utility to fellow Democrats owing to his weak standing in polls, stayed largely out of sight Monday, though he was heard in a new radio spot for North Carolina Sen.

Other contests among Tuesdays 36 gubernatorial elections were far more competitive, including Wisconsin, where Republican Scott Walker hoped reelection to a second term would help launch him into a 2016 presidential run., The man who stands to benefit most from a Republican Senate takeover, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, spent the day barreling across his home state of Kentucky, accompanied by Rand Paul, the states junior Republican senator and another likely White House contestant in 2016., \"I dont believe our state has ever had two senators in a better position to influence the course of events in our country than we have right now,\" McConnell told supporters at an event at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \"Were counting on you not to give that up.\", McConnells middling popularity after decades in Washington presented Democrats with a rare chance to gain a seat that would offset expected losses elsewhere. But after a costly and close-fought race against Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, McConnell appeared to have gained a bit of breathing room and glanced ahead to serving in the majority., \"Look, we need to get the Senate back to normal and we need to pass bills,\" said McConnell, blaming Obama for the Washington gridlock that Grimes sought to tie around his neck. \"We need to put them on his desk. We dont know whether hell sign them or not, but by golly were going to start functioning again.\", Grimes, staging her own last-minute statewide blitz, said she was poised to shock the presumed political experts. \"Were on our way to making history,\" she said at an outdoor rally in Newport, with the Cincinnati skyline behind her across the Ohio River. \"This will be a photo finish.\", In Colorado, scene of one of the nations hottest Senate races, the two contestants were among an untold army of candidates, political operatives and volunteers across the country focused on their No. 1 priority in the next 24 hours: getting voters to the polls., Democratic Sen. Mark Udall, battling for a second term, visited Metropolitan State University of Denver, where he made his pitch to Latino voters, a key party constituency that has shown signs of apathy this election season. Joined by former Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, a onetime Colorado senator, Udall called for an overhaul of the nations immigration laws and vowed to pressure Obama the day after the election to take executive action to keep families together., \"Your vote matters. Your vote is your voice. Su voto es su voz,\" Udall said., While the embattled incumbent rode his sky-blue campaign bus to multiple stops across the Denver region, his challenger, Republican Rep. Cory Gardner, made just one public appearance, rallying volunteers in the suburbs south of Denver. \"We have always said Colorado will be the tip of the spear,\" Gardner said. \"The fulcrum of power, the opportunity to change this direction around.\", In Iowa, another state key to control of the Senate, a final-day flap arose over comments retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin made comparing the Republican nominee, state Sen. Joni Ernst, to ingenue singer Taylor Swift., \"Ive been watching some of these ads,\" Harkin said at a Story County barbecue, according to video posted Sunday night by Buzzfeed. \"And theres sort of this sense that, Well, I hear so much about Joni Ernst. She is really attractive, and she sounds nice., \"Well I got to thinking about that. I dont care if shes as good looking as Taylor Swift or as nice as Mr. Rogers ... if she votes like Michele Bachmann, shes wrong for the state of Iowa,\" Harkin said, referring to the fiercely conservative Minnesota congresswoman., Ernst, facing Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley in a closely fought contest, has campaigned as \"a southwest Iowa farm girl,\" citing her experience castrating pigs and promising to apply the same sharpened blade to Washington spending. After initially taking offense at Harkins remarks in a Fox News interview, Ernst later brushed aside the comments. \"You know what,\" Ernst said on KCCI TV in Des Moines, \"just as Taylor Swift would say: Shake it off.\", Later, Harkin issued a statement apologizing. \"I am only human and I can make mistakes sometimes in how I say something,\" he said., michael.memoli@latimes.com, kurtis.lee@latimes.com, Twitter: @mikememoli, @kurtisalee, Memoli reported from Kentucky and Lee from Colorado.

{"Content": "[[, House Republicans on Friday conducted a series of largely symbolic votes against the nuclear deal with Iran, following the collapse of their effort to send a congressional resolution of disapproval to President Obamas desk., Instead the GOP-led House called up a resolution to approve the deal, defeating it 162-269., No Republicans voted in favor of the deal, though one voted present. Twenty-five Democrats joined the Republican majority against it, showing the influence of Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) in holding her partys support for President Obama., The House also voted 247-186 to suspend the lifting of economic sanctions until Jan. 21, 2017, after the next president is seated in the White House. That bill is unlikely to pass the Senate., The boisterous House debate unfolded on an otherwise somber day in Washington and nationwide as lawmakers incorporatedremembrances of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks., NEWSLETTER:Get the days top headlines from Times Editor Davan Maharaj >>, After Democrats in the Senate delivered a decisive victory to the White House earlier this week by blocking the Republican-led resolution of disapproval against the deal, the GOP majority in the House was left with few options for stopping it., Without congressional roadblocks, the U.S. and its partners can proceed with implementing the accord, reached with Iran and five leading nations: Britain, Germany, France, Russia and China. The deal aims to halt Irans nuclear program in exchange for a lifting of international economic sanctions., \"I know the president may have already lined up enough support to save his deal,\" said Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.), the partys former vice presidential nominee. \"But with this vote we need to send a message to both Iran and the world. The regime might have bamboozled this administration, but the American people know this is a rotten deal.\", Foreshadowing the expected campaign attacks that lie ahead in the 2016 election, lawmakers spoke in partisan, and at times deeply personal, terms about what for many became a painstaking decision., While many Republicans argued that the White House should have negotiated a better deal, Democrats largely saw the accord as the best alternative to military action to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb., \"I dont think any of us have any idea if this agreement is going to hold,\" said Rep. Charles E. Rangel (D-N.Y.), an Army veteran of the Korean War. \"I know the horrors of war. We should always give diplomacy a chance before we put any Americans into harms way.\", Republican leaders, including House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), have promised the fight is not over. More votes are expected next week., But with most Democrats in both the House and Senate forming a line of defense backing Obama, Congress has almost no ability to change the outcome before its self-imposed Sept. 17 deadline., Instead, Republicans are expected to try to chisel away at the deal in both legislative action and in public opinion during the campaigns ahead. , For the latest from Congress and 2016 campaign follow @LisaMascaro, ALSO:, Uproar among House GOP conservatives forces new strategy on Iran vote, Secure in Iran deal victory, White House is gently mocking its opponents, Hillary Clinton makes case for Iran deal, and a more hawkish approach in Middle East]", "Date": "20150911", "Title": "[After failing to block Iran deal, GOP conducts symbolic votes against it]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-house-iran-vote-20150911-story.html", "Author": "[Lisa Mascaro]"}
{"Content": "[[, House Republicans pushed past their internal divisions to approve a budget blueprint Wednesday, putting the new Congress on track to notch a significant achievement once Senate Republicans pass their version by the end of the week., The ambitious but largely symbolic spending proposals adhere to Republican ideas for slashing social safety-net programs and lowering tax rates., But they have drawn criticism for dramatically boosting defense spending in a way that breaks with the Republican pledge to stick to deficit-lowering limits imposed at their own behest just a few years ago., Overcoming those differences between the partys defense and deficit hawks posed a daunting challenge for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and his leadership team. Rather than take sides, Boehner took the unusual step of allowing competing proposals to come to the floor, letting the top vote-getter win., Both budget versions would boost Pentagon spending, but one would make part of the money contingent on finding spending cuts elsewhere, an uncertain prospect. The other version  backed by military supporters  would provide the extra money regardless., In a win for defense hawks, the House voted 219 to 208 for the amendment that guaranteed the money. The final budget was approved 228 to 199. All Democrats opposed., Budgets arent easy things, clearly, said House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price (R-Ga.) as voting began. Weve navigated some interesting times., The Senate, meanwhile, continued working through amendments to its plan, with passage expected late Thursday or early Friday in an all-night session., Once both chambers finish their work this week, new challenges await when they return from a spring break next month., The House and Senate must reconcile their different versions, which could prove difficult. The House plan overhauls Medicare by creating a voucher-like option for seniors to purchase private health insurance. Senate Republicans have distanced themselves from that approach and did not include it in their budget., But they will have to resolve those discrepancies if they hope to achieve one of their top goals  passage of a bill to repeal President Obamas healthcare law., Though the House has voted more than 50 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act, legislation has never been sent to the president because it could not overcome opposition in the Senate., The budget process offers a special opportunity that would allow Republicans to pass a bill to repeal the healthcare law with only a simple majority, averting a Democratic filibuster in the Senate., Obama would certainly veto such legislation, but getting the measure to the presidents desk would give Republicans boasting rights in future election campaigns., Passage of the budget proposals also fulfill a GOP promise to break the gridlock in Congress and govern more effectively. Republicans frequently criticized Democrats for failing to pass a budget in recent years when they held the majority in the Senate., Republicans say their 2016 blueprint would balance the budget within a decade, unlike a rival plan offered this year by Obama., But critics note that the GOP budget balances by making several assumptions about economic growth and future spending cuts that may not come to fruition. Republicans also count on the tax revenue collected through Obamas healthcare law, even as they vow to repeal it., In crafting their budgets, Republicans struggled to cope with spending caps mandated in the 2011 Budget Control Act, also know as the sequester. It requires steep cuts for domestic and defense budgets., Obamas plan simply did away with the sequester cuts, relying on tax hikes for the rich and allowing an increase in the deficit., GOP budget drafters instead found a creative way to get around the sequester cap on the main defense account, which sets the Pentagon budget at $523 billion for fiscal 2016., To add money, the GOP budgets rely on a separate account that has usually been used for overseas contingency operations  most recently the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. That account also has the advantage of not being covered under the sequester., The overseas contingency account will grow to $96 billion under the House and Senate proposals --- $20 billion over this years level and $38 billion beyond what Obama requested in his 2016 budget., Steve Ellis, a budget watcher at the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, noted the new level is about half what it was in fiscal 2008, when the Pentagon was fighting the war in Afghanistan and sending more soldiers to Iraq., They decided instead of busting the budget caps, they would just evade the budget caps, Ellis said., It really is an insult to the intelligence of the American taxpayers, he said. Theyre going to have this whole extra slush fund  now slushier than ever  for Pentagon spending., For the latest from Congress follow @LisaMascaro.]", "Date": "20150325", "Title": "[House GOP approves budget to hike defense, slash safety-net programs]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-house-budget-deal-20150325-story.html", "Author": "[Lisa Mascaro]"}
{"Content": "[[, House Republicans won the opening round in a lawsuit against President Obama over their claim that his administration spent money for health insurers under the Affordable Care Act without receivingneeded approval by Congress., U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer ruled Wednesday that the lawmakers have the legal standing to sue., The Constitution could not be more clear: No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of Appropriations made by Law, she said, quoting a key provision. Neither the president nor his officers can authorize appropriations; the assent of the House of Representatives is required before any public monies are spent., The judge rejected pleas by Obamas lawyers to dismiss the House lawsuit on the grounds it involved a political dispute, not a legal one. Collyer noted that the House claimed it would suffer an institutional injury if the president and his aides could spend money on their own authority., Her ruling is only the first step, however. She told lawyers she wouldhear arguments in the fall on whether the administrations action violated the Constitution., If Collyer, a judicial appointee of President George W. Bush, were to decide in favor of the House on the merits, Obamas lawyers would appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where Democratic appointees are in the majority., From there, the case could move to the Supreme Court. Unless the dispute moves with unusual speed, a final decision might not come until after Obama has left office., Nonetheless, Collyers initial ruling is a victory for House Speaker John A. Boehner, and it is likely to be seen as endorsing the GOPs view that Obama overstepped his authority., In a statement, Boehner said he was grateful to the court for ruling that this historic overreach can be challenged by the coequal branch of government with the sole power to create or change the law. The presidents unilateral change to Obamacare was unprecedented and outside the powers granted to his office under our Constitution., The White House said it would seek an immediate appeal., The law is clear that Congress cannot try to settle garden variety disputes with the executive branch in court, said Deputy Press Secretary Jen Friedman. This case is just another partisan attack  this one, paid for by the taxpayers  and we believe the courts will ultimately dismiss it., Many lawyers saw the House suit as unprecedented. In the past, courts have regularly said lawmakers do not have standing to turn their political fights into legal battles., Last summer, when the House voted to sue Obama, many legal experts predicted the suit would be tossed at the first stage. Boehner had first alleged that Obamas aides had violated the law when they waived several deadlines under the Affordable Care Act., But more recently, the lawyers for the House focused on a little-known dispute over how to reimburse health insurers who take on more low-income policyholders., The Affordable Care Act said these insurers would be reimbursed for waiving copayments and other costs for these new policyholders, but it did not make clear whether this money would be provided automatically or instead would require an annual appropriation from Congress., So far, the administration has spent $4 billion, and the total spending is expected to reach $175 billion over a decade., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, After the Republican-led House refused to appropriate money, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell decided the reimbursements were mandatory under the law and could be provided despite the lack of an appropriation., Law professor Jonathan Turley, the lead counsel for the House, said the judges ruling means the court will decide an issue that drives to the very heart of our constitutional system: the control of the legislative branch over the power of the purse., Despite the setback, health law experts do not see this case as posing a major challenge to the future of Obamas healthcare law. If spending for the reimbursements were cut off, insurers might have to raise premiums somewhat. Other experts say the insurance companies could turn to a federal claims court to seek reimbursements., MORE POLITICALNEWS, For some Republicans, Ben Carson is Trump minus bluster plus faith, Secure in Iran deal victory, White House is gently mocking its opponents, Hillary Clinton makes case for Iran deal, and a more hawkish approach in Middle East]", "Date": "20150909", "Title": "[Judge allows unusual House GOP lawsuit against president to proceed]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-obamacare-gop-lawsuit-20150909-story.html", "Author": "[David G.

He said his action was not a precursor to impeachment., \"The Constitution makes it clear that the presidents job is to faithfully execute the laws.

They also passed a raft of bills aimed at winning back public trust in an election year (though the ruling Democrats, tarnished by criminal charges against several party legislators, failed to regain a supermajority in the Capitol)., Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown, who meanwhile rode a wave of popularity to a historic fourth and final term, vetoed 143 bills the Legislature sent him, saying they cost too much money, did not improve the state or created unnecessary regulations. He signed 930 others into law., Most of those take effect Jan. 1. Others dont kick in until July, including a ban on single-use plastic grocery bags. Opponents have submitted petitions for a referendum on the law; if the referendum qualifies for the November 2016 ballot, the ban will be delayed until that vote., Also taking effect in July are a minimum of three days paid sick leave each year for workers and a $300-million annual tax break for Hollywood., One law being implemented now allows police or family members to seek a restraining order that bars a person deemed dangerous from possessing firearms for 21 days.

In April, a record $2.5-million fine was levied by the National Basketball Assn. against then-Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, whose disparaging comments about African Americans caused public outrage., Other new state laws include:, BABIES, Breast feeding: Large airports in California must provide, behind the security screening and separate from restrooms, a room where women can express breast milk., Maternity leave: State universities may not require female graduate students to take leaves of absence for pregnancies and must allow those who do take leaves to return in good standing., BUSINESS, Bitcoin: Digital currencies including bitcoin are legal for transactions in California., Online reviews: Nondisparagement clauses in consumer contracts for goods or services in the state of California are now unenforceable; therefore, businesses cannot use them for civil lawsuits against Californians offering opinions or reviews on Internet sites such as Yelp., CIVIL RIGHTS, Confederate flag: State entities are barred from displaying or selling copies of the Confederate flag or objects marked with it, unless the image appears in a book, digital medium or state museum for educational or historical purposes., CRIME, Badges: Those convicted of using a badge to impersonate a peace officer will pay a higher fine: $2,000 rather than $1,000., Drugs: Those convicted of possessing crack cocaine for sale, who previously could be sentenced to three to five years in jail, now face two to four years  the same penalty applied to offenses involving powder cocaine., Juvenile records: Juveniles convicted of crimes will have their records automatically sealed if they complete all court-imposed orders., Sex offenders: Paroled sex offenders who fail to report for fitting with a GPS monitoring device, or who willfully render such a device inoperable, face a mandatory 180 days in jail., EDUCATION, Allergies: Public schools must stock epinephrine injectors so medicine can be administered quickly to students who suffer serious allergic reactions., Bad behavior: Schools can no longer expel students who \"willfully defy\" teachers or administrators at any grade level and cannot suspend students for that misbehavior through third grade., Consent: Colleges and universities must adopt a standard of clear consent for students engaging in sexual activity. \"Affirmative consent\" is required by both participants., Equality: Public schools must publish the number of girls and boys participating in each sport to show whether the sexes have the required equal access to athletic programs., Genocide lessons: State education officials must consider incorporating lessons about the Armenian genocide and other mass killings, such as those in Rwanda and Darfur, into curriculum standards that will be updated in 2015.

{"Content": "[[, Hundreds of Taiwanese students were locked in a standoff with authorities in Taipei on Friday after storming the national legislature and surrounding the Education Ministry in a protest over new curriculum guidelines., Anguished by the apparent suicide of one student protest group member on Thursday, the demonstrators were demanding the resignation of Education Minister Wu Se-hwa and the shelving of the guidelines. They also want authorities to drop all legal charges against a group of activists who stormed into Wus offices last week., Tensions over the guidelines for high school history classes, due to take effect Saturday, have been mounting since last year, and the debate is becoming a political issue in the run-up to the islands 2016 presidential election., The revisions were initiated by the Education Ministry in 2014. Officials with the ruling Nationalist Party describe them as minor changes intended to make the curriculum more factually accurate and to emphasize Taiwanese identity., But opponents have charged that the revisions whitewash Taiwans authoritarian period under Nationalist rule before it became a democracy in the early 1990s, and amount to inserting pro-mainland China ideology into the curriculum. In particular, they complain that a violent crackdown on student protesters in 1947 by the Nationalist government has been left out of the curriculum., Critics also allege that the revision process was not conducted in a fully transparent manner, and complain about the composition of the panel that formulated the changes. Among its members was a professor who also serves as vice chairman of a group called the Alliance for the Reunification of China., Wu refused Friday afternoon to step down and said he would work to resolve the conflict. He reiterated that the new guidelines were not mandatory and that it was up to individual schools and teachers to decide what textbooks to adopt. Educators are still free to use older textbooks written before the recent guidelines., Taiwan has been self-ruled since Chinas civil war ended in 1949, with Chiang Kai-sheks Nationalists fleeing to the island after being defeated by the Communists on the mainland. But Communist Party leaders in Beijing regard Taiwan as a renegade province and part of one China, and insist that the two sides must eventually be reunited., Under President Ma Ying-jeou of the Nationalist Party, Taiwan has pursued closer trade ties with the mainland. Businesses and others have welcomed the economic rapprochement but some constituencies, particularly young people, have eyed the closer ties with some skepticism., In March and April 2014, students opposed to a trade pact with the mainland stormed the legislature in protest, in a development that became known as the Sunflower Movement. The occupiers argued that the agreement could damage Taiwans economy and open it to greater political pressure from Beijing., The curriculum revisions have struck a similar nerve. Last week, 33 people, including 24 students, were arrested after occupying the Ministry of Education on July 23., Among them was a 19-year-old, Dai Lin, a member of the Northern Taiwan Anti-Curriculum Changes Alliance., Lin was found dead Thursday, his 20th birthday, at his home in an apparent suicide, the Taiwan Times reported. Mourners were planning a candlelight vigil Friday evening in his honor., Visiting the demonstrators on Friday afternoon, the mayor of Taipei, Ko Wen-je, called on Wu to face up to the students as soon as possible to reach a deal and conclusion., Taiwan should not be involved in a war of extremism because of ideological issues, he added, while urging students to protest with reason and peace and advising them that police are not public enemies., But the protests may go on for some time, said J. Michael Cole, a senior non-resident fellow at the University of Nottinghams China Policy Institute and a researcher at theThinking Taiwan Foundation, a think tank launched in 2012 by Tsai Ing-wen, who is now the Democratic Progressive Partys nominee for the 2016presidential election., Wu is unlikely to step down and the government is unlikely to freeze or mothball the proposal, Cole said. The Nationalists are behind in the polls for the 2016 election, he noted, while Tsai is ahead., \"With their expected loss in the Jan. 16 elections, there is less pressure on [the Nationalists]to do what society wants, so the Maadministration could very well stick to its position,\" he said. \"Looks like we might be in this for the long haul.\", Harvard Zhang, Nicole Liu and Tommy Yang in the Times Beijing bureau contributed to this report. , 4 a.m.: This article has been updated with quotes from analyst J.

{"Content": "[[, I admit it. I was one of those people (mostly women, I suspect) who, back when Hillary Rodham Clinton left the State Department to \"catch up on 20 years of sleep deprivation,\" figured that some of that catching up would also involve some measure of cosmetic freshening up., Though she was still being coy about whether shed make another run for White House, I figured if she did, the 2.0 version of Clinton the candidate would be not just older and wiser but also fitter and smoother  possibly by way of the nips, tucks and injections that are now essentially de rigeur for powerful women of a certain age., But flattering lighting and professional hairstyling aside, the Clinton that announced her candidacy on a YouTube video Sunday looked every bit her 67 years. Following in the venerable tradition of so many aging male politicians, Clinton is vying for the most powerful post in the free world with jowls, face creases and a less-than-Pilates-toned physique., Meanwhile, all of us who were taking bets on whether shed get a whole face-lift or simply Botox herself into generic acceptability can eat our words., While were at it, we should kiss Clintons feet. By unapologetically looking her age, shes giving all women a license to stay in the spotlight even as they mature past their younger, dewier years. And with any luck, she just might put the whole concept of a female expiration date out to pasture., Say what you will about Clinton  and as much has been said about her as any political figure in modern history  it would take some pretty twisted logic to argue that she is anything but flush with the one quality that presumably matters most: experience., Of course, experience is what also gets Clinton in trouble. She has a bit too much of it, or at least too much thats attackable by her enemies. But as things stand, after four years as secretary of State and with a record high approval rating, shes at the least highly competent; her track record goes the distance, and then some., The problem is that such competence, and the experience that creates it, can be a double-edged sword for women. Theres no substitute for it, and no shortcuts. Generally speaking, you can only really achieve it by getting older and eventually getting old. And if youre a woman  particularly in the United States  youre not really allowed to do that in public., Or maybe at least not until now., Given the relentless scrutiny Clinton endures  from her supporters as well as her opponents and about everything from her policy positions to her hairstyles and pant suits  running for president not just as a woman but as a woman of a certain age who dares to look that age seems nothing short of radical. If she succeeds, she will send the message that women can not only make it to the highest levels of U.S. public life, they actually have just as much time to get there as men., Curiously, though, even Clintons most ardent supporters may have a hard time receiving that message. Last month, in a column (an affectionate one, in my view) that likened Clinton to a suitcase coming back around on a long luggage carousel, I got a slew of angry mail, much of it from women of roughly Clintons age. But it wasnt because of the suitcase comparison. It was because I referred to her as a \"67-year-old grandmother.\", According to news reports, Clinton and her handlers plan to actively use her grandmother status to shape her image. But I was testily informed that \"grandmother\" is somehow just as demeaning as all the truly ugly epithets her haters have come up with over the years. This though her \"defenders\" surely know that male politicians are all too happy to flex their paterfamilias muscles by parading around their kids and grandkids., Thats exactly why Clintons willingness to age in front of us is both commendable and crucial. Society is unlikely to stop valuing women for their youth  thats just the biological imperative at work. But until we stop punishing women for having wisdom and experience, until we stop seeing the word \"grandmother\" as a form of negative messaging for female leaders, we will continue to drastically limit our options., And Hillary Clinton is nothing if not a reminder of just how few leaders and options  female or male, Democrat or Republican, young or old  we have to choose from., mdaum@latimescolumnists.com, Twitter: @meghan_daum, Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinionandFacebook]", "Date": "20150415", "Title": "[Hillary Clinton's no-knife, no-Botox run for the White House]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-daum-hillary-clinton-grandmother-20150414-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, I keep thinking were done with George Pataki  but like an order of bad clams, he keeps coming back up on me., The three-term Republican governor of a famously blue state seems like a serious 2016 presidential contender on paper  until you read the fine print., Pataki had a promising start as New York governor. He beat Democratic icon Mario Cuomo in 1994. He cut income taxes 25% and trimmed others as well. In his first two years in office, spending went down 2.5%., If you had stopped the Pataki show there, everything would be great. Similarly, if Napoleon had quit before invading Russia, hed be remembered very differently too., Its a journalistic cliche to say that when a Republican lurches left hes \"growing in office.\" Woodrow Wilson once said that every politician either grows or swells when he enters office. Pataki did both and for so long, conservatives felt he should have come with a Viagra-like warning label: If this apostasy lasts for more than one campaign, consult a physician., In advance of his 1998 reelection bid, he asked the state legislature to increase spending 8%. He flip-flopped on ending rent control in New York City, on blocking the state takeover of Long Island Lighting Co. and on sending his kids to public school. The defenestration of his principles was so spectacular, even the editors of the New York Times were impressed. They endorsed him for reelection in 1998, praising his \"inclusive and progressive attitude.\" The Cato Institutes fiscal report card dubbed Pataki a \"liberal big spender.\", \"Pataki-land has become a place that sells out on everything,\" George Marlin, a Pataki appointee to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, told National Reviews John Miller in 2005. \"The governor is going to leave the Republican Party intellectually bankrupt and the state fiscally bankrupt.\", When Pataki finally left office, New York Post state editor Fred Dicker wrote that \"Pataki broke virtually every political promise he ever made.\" He also noted how incredibly lazy Pataki was. According to friends, Pataki worked about 15 hours a week. \"He held no more than three Cabinet meetings during his entire 12 years in office,\" Dicker wrote., It would be normal for a three-term governor to downplay his last two years as a lame duck in office. Pataki plays the movie backward. The first two years are all he talks about, as if the final 10 never happened., Thats why his populist shtick rings so false. In his announcement speech last week, he said that if elected president, \"The first thing I would do is ban members of Congress from ever lobbying. If you serve one day, you are banned, go home.\" That sounds great, though how a president has the power to do anything of the sort is beyond me., He barked at Washington politicians, \"From now on, you will live under the same rules and laws we do  no special rules for the powerful.\" Again great stuff, but a bit hard to take from the guy who vowed to sell off New York states fleet of planes and then, once elected, used them as his private airline., I am trying hard not rule out anyone in the GOP field prematurely. So far, only Donald Trump has been too heavy a lift. Trump sees the presidential race as self-marketing opportunity, a way to extend his run as a reality TV star. Hes a more plausible candidate than, say, Honey Boo Boo, but thats mostly because of constitutional age limits., Pataki vexes me for similar reasons. The pro-choice, liberal Republican has virtually no chance of getting the nomination. But lots of people run as vanity projects. I wish they wouldnt, but itd be unfair to single Pataki out for it., But most vanity candidates also tend to run to promote their core convictions. For instance, many believe South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham is running so he can debate foreign policy., Pataki is flipping that on its head too. Hes pretending to have core convictions just so he can run for the sake of running., jgoldberg@latimescolumnists.com, Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinionandFacebook]", "Date": "20150602", "Title": "[ The false populism of George Pataki]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0602-goldberg-pataki-2016-20150602-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, I spent part of August on vacation in Canada, only to find myself on what was once called a busmans holiday: Canadians are in the throes of a national election campaign, just like us. And, just like us, theyre grouchy about the state of their democracy., They say their campaign goes on too long  \"a marathon,\" one broadcaster complained. They fret that its awash in money. By election day, candidates, parties and political action committees will spend the equivalent of more than $40 million U.S., And they worry that the democratic process has turned angry and uncivil. At one campaign event, a supporter of the incumbent prime minister, the conservative Stephen Harper, told the assembled media that they were \"lying pieces of [ordure].\", Canadians dont know how lucky they are. Their \"marathon\" lasts less than three months; ours takes almost two years. Their $40 million in campaign spending is dwarfed by the $7 billion we spent in 2012, and well spend more than that in 2016., Canadians do have one complaint that we cant share., \"Canadian politics is so boring,\" my friend Susan told me over lunch in a Toronto restaurant. \"Yours is much more entertaining.\", On Aug. 6, when Canadas party leaders debated on television, Susan and her husband skipped it  and watched Fox News Republican debate instead. \"What a show!\" she said., For an American, Canadas way of politics is like a reverse fun-house mirror: A glimpse of how our democracy might look if it were normal, without the grotesque distortions of reality show personalities and unlimited donations. The issues are big, the stakes are high, and the outcome matters for Americans too., Harper is running for the fourth time after nine years in office. (No term limits!) But Harper, who cruised to reelection in 2011 after steering Canada through the Great Recession, is facing stiff head winds this time. He made Albertas tar-sands oil his favored engine of economic growth, but oil prices have collapsed, sending Canada into a modest recession., Hes got a political scandal on his hands too. His chief of staff secretly reimbursed the government for $90,000 in illegal expenses racked up by a conservative senator, raising the question of what the prime minister knew and when he knew it., Harpers toughest challenger was supposed to be Justin Trudeau, the leader of Canadas Liberal Party, which is actually the countrys centrist party. Trudeau, the glamour boy of Canadian politics, is the son of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who reigned as prime minister for most of the 16 years from 1968 to 1984. The younger Trudeau is 43 but looks about 35. The good news: A poll found that hes the candidate Canadians would most enjoy going on vacation with. The bad news: The same poll found that voters would rather hire Harper to run a large enterprise., Instead, the surprise front-runner is the leader of Canadas leftish third party, the New Democrats. Tom Mulcairs campaign has boiled down to two arguments: Its time for a change, and the NDP is the only party that can credibly deliver that., At the same time, Mulcair has worked to dispel his partys image as a bunch of free-spending socialists, promising to balance the federal budget in his first year., If Mulcair becomes prime minister after the Oct. 19 election, heres what that would mean for Canada-U.S. relations: Mulcair says hes opposed to the Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry tar-sands oil to refineries in Texas. If he canceled the project, that would remove Keystone from the U.S. presidential campaign  a relief for Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has refused to take a position on it., Mulcair would move Canada closer to the U.S. position on climate change; under Harper, Canada has increased its emissions of greenhouse gases. But Mulcair says hed withdraw Canadian forces from Iraq, where they have joined U.S. forces in the air war against Islamic State., More interesting than the candidates (for Americans, at least) is how Canadians run their democracy: Its so civilized its almost quaint., Canada has campaign finance laws that work: Each donor can give up to $1,500 to a political party and up to $1,500 to a candidate. There are also independent committees, like our \"super PACs\"  but unlike ours, which can spend an unlimited amount, the Canadian groups must keep to a pitiful $206,000 in advertising expenditures., Another difference: Once a Canadian election is over, the parliamentary system normally guarantees the winner a chance to enact his or her program  since the winner usually has a working majority in Parliament. Divided government and gridlock arent built into the system., As columnist Terry Glavin wrote in Torontos conservative National Post this month: \"All of this makes for the dullest, most boring sort of country, comparatively and politically speaking. And we would be wise not to want it any other way.\", Theres a lesson here for Americans: Democracy comes in different shapes and sizes. Canadians have shown that free speech can flourish under strict limits on campaign spending  and Harper, whatever his shortcomings, has proved that conservatives can win under spending limits too. Our version of democracy may be more entertaining.

{"Content": "[[, I talked with Republican wise men last week  sober establishment strategists who have seen many presidential campaigns come and go  to ask them how long the improbable popularity of Donald Trump can last. Reassure me, I said: He cant actually win, right?, Their answers surprised me., \"Its not inconceivable,\" Vin Weber, a former congressman (and Jeb Bush supporter) told me. \"It doesnt look as if hes going to implode any time soon. Its hard for me to say this, but he actually seems to be getting better as a candidate.\", TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, \"Trump has put himself on the short list of five or six names who could win the nomination,\" said another GOP operative who insisted on anonymity because hes working for one of those other candidates. \"Its not impossible that he could win.\", Until a few weeks ago, the conventional wisdom held that Trump was merely a summer fling for angry voters, a protest candidate whose insults and braggadocio would soon impose a ceiling on his support. But recent polls suggest that Trump has raised that ceiling., Hes leading almost every horse race poll  although at this stage, those numbers are utterly unreliable as predictors of real voter behavior. (At this point in 2011, the polls were led by Texas Gov. Rick Perry; in 2007, by former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.), More telling are polls that measure whether Trump has made himself acceptable to Republicans., A Quinnipiac University poll last month found that 30% of GOP voters had an unfavorable view of Trump  worse than most other candidates but a big improvement from the 52% that Trump scored in May., In Iowa, where the first GOP contest is held, the percentage of likely Republican caucus-goers who say they could never vote for Trump has fallen from 58% in May to 29%, according to a Des Moines Register-Bloomberg News poll., Get your free weekly take on the most pertinent, discussed topics of the day>>, What has Trump done right? He began by grabbing voters attention with a naked appeal to anti-immigrant anger. But hes broadened his pitch with broadsides against a \"corrupt\" political system, Wall Street financiers and corporations that send U.S. jobs overseas., There are even signs that he might ease up on the insults  glimpses of a new, more statesmanlike Donald. \"I have great respect for a lot of the other people on the stage,\" he said Friday., My GOP wise men outlined two possible scenarios: one for a Trump victory, the other for defeat., Trump could win, they suggested, if he rolls out more policy proposals to demonstrate that he has actually thought about what hed do as president (hes already promised one on tax reform), and if he survives increased scrutiny from the media as well as attacks from other candidates (Bush has already started in)., Trump will lose, they said, if he cant handle criticism of his record or his paper-thin positions on many issues. Last week, he bobbled a question from conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, admitting testily that he didnt know the names of the leaders of Al Qaeda or Islamic State., Less likely, he could simply run out of new things to say. \"You have to presume he cant dominate the media for five more months this way,\" Weber said. \"What happens to him when the attention starts to dry up?\", Trump will face a tough early test in Iowa, where the Republican caucuses have been dominated by Christian social conservatives not his natural constituency., See the most-read stories this hour >>, \"If he comes in third or fourth in Iowa, he could lose his cool,\" one strategist said. \"If he looks like a sore loser and says he was robbed, that could cause the floor to fall out.\", On the other hand, another strategist told me, \"The Southern primaries [in February and March] are a huge opportunity for him. If he wins enough of those, the rest of the field will collapse because their money will dry up. At that point, it becomes Trump versus someone else, an anti-Trump  probably Rubio, Walker, Kasich or Bush. And then its a real race.\", On balance, a Trump victory still appears unlikely; his conservative credentials are too weak, his political experience too thin. \"Im hearing people talk about him as if he were the inevitable nominee,\" Weber said. \"We arent there yet.\", But Republican Partys grandees are glumly acknowledging that Americas love affair with Trump is more than a summer romance  maybe a lot more., doyle.mcmanus@latimes.com, Twitter: @doylemcmanus, Follow the Opinion section on Twitter@latimesopinion and Facebook, ALSO:, Less water might be plenty for California, experts say, and conservation is only the start, As migrants pour into Germany, Pope Francis calls on faithful to take them in, U.S. judge dismisses challenge of Arizonas SB 1070 immigration law]", "Date": "20150906", "Title": "[Trump can't actually win, can he?]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0906-mcmanus-trump-20150906-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, I visited friends last week in Brittany, the French province whose wild Atlantic coast resembles Northern California or Maine. And what do you think a dinner table full of smart French people wanted to talk about? The American presidential campaign., Ive always found it remarkable how much attention people in other countries pay to American politics. Is it because our political personalities are so compelling? More likely its because the decisions our presidents make end up affecting other peoples lives., France has a presidential election coming up too, and most Americans havent given it a moments thought. But when it comes to U.S. politics, the French can name many of our leading candidates., My hosts were a French couple, Pascal and Martine Lebehot; hes a high school teacher, shes an auditor for the regional government (and the cousin of one of my wifes oldest friends, which is how we met them)., They mostly had one question: \"Will Hillary win?\", Theyre taken, understandably, with the Clinton family saga: A charismatic president falls into a sex scandal, only to regain his popularity  \"You mean that doesnt happen only in France?\" Pascal asked mockingly  and might now be succeeded by his wife., They wanted to know if Americans were ready to elect a woman, something France has never done. \"Its a good idea,\" Martine advised. \"Just look at Angela Merkel and Margaret Thatcher.\", They wanted to know which family would come out on top, Clinton or Bush. \"Dynasties  just like France before the revolution,\" Pascal said., \"This Bush is smarter than his brother, right?\" Martine asked. Thats his reputation, I said, but hes just as conservative as George W. Bush. She made an unhappy little moue., But there are also insurgent candidates among the Republicans, I added, among them Ted Cruz, whose father groomed him to be a leader from a young age. \"Ah,\" said Pascal. \"Just like Joseph Kennedy and his sons\"  an analogy no American pundit has noticed, as far as I know., They recoiled in mock horror when I explained that the Republicans could have 16 candidates in next years primaries. (Frances center-right Republicains have only one candidate, former President Nicolas Sarkozy. He recently renamed the party, apparently to make it sound more American. Go figure.), Unwisely, I tried to impress them by reeling off all 16 GOP names. I could only remember 15. (Sorry, Gov. Bobby Jindal. It must have been the wine.), They were interested to hear that our Republicans are divided over immigration, just like theirs. But our immigrants are mostly Latinos, while theirs are mostly Muslim, so the issues quickly diverge., They were intrigued that the GOP field, with two Cuban Americans and one African American, is more diverse than the Democrats., And, as if to prove that French civilization is still superior, they had never heard of Le Donald. (Sorry, Mr. Trump.), \"Theres one thing Ive always been curious about,\" Pascal said. \"Whats a GOP?\" (He pronounced it to rhyme with \"top.\"), A few days earlier, another French friend had posed a more probing question with genuine puzzlement. \"Your economy is doing a lot better than ours,\" he said. \"Why is everyone so mad at Obama?\", The short version, I said, is that were a grouchy nation right now  grouchy about an economy thats not delivering higher incomes to ordinary people, grouchy about the inability of our political system to solve problems., The French have a word for that: \"la morosit,\" or \"moroseness,\" a national funk at which Parisians believe they excel., But you dont look very morose, I told Pascal as he brought out a tray of many cheeses., \"Were really quite morose,\" he replied without a trace of irony., And for many of the same reasons were grouchy. Two-income professional couples like Pascal and Martine are doing fine; theyre planning a vacation trip to New York City next month., But theyre worried about their children and grandchildren in an economy thats not producing enough jobs. Theyre angry at politicians of both right and left who seem to spend more time cultivating wealthy patrons and running for office than solving problems., After all the spats between France and the United States over the last 12 years, it turns out that we have at least one thing in common: la morosit. Citizens of the Wests two founding democracies dont think democracy is working properly any more., But they still wanted to know whos going to win the 2016 presidential election., I insisted, boringly, that it was far too soon to tell, so Pascal bravely stepped in., \"Hillary seems like the most logical candidate,\" he declared. \"But in France, after one party has the presidency for two terms, a lot of people just think its time for a change.

{"Content": "[[, If anyone had any illusions that Hillary Clintons June book tour would feel like anything other than the launch of a presidential campaign, the furious debate over her depiction of her State Department tenure this week corrected that impression., In the slow rollout of Clintons latest memoir \"Hard Choices,\" the books promoters have released several excerpts. The first was to the women-friendly venue of Vogue magazine for Mothers Day. Then there were excerpts and several soft-focus videos featuring Clinton talking about the book posted on its Facebook page. But on Friday, Politico obtained the first harder-edged slice of the book, detailing Clintons account of the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi., Republicans predictably pounced, offering a preview of the debate that will unfold when the book is officially launched June 10., Those who exploit this tragedy over and over as a political tool minimize the sacrifice of those who served our country, Clinton wrote in the chapter Benghazi: Under Attack according to the Politico report. I will not be part of a political slugfest on the backs of dead Americans. Its just plain wrong, and its unworthy of our great country. Those who insist on politicizing the tragedy will have to do so without me., Clinton goes on to say that the attack on the diplomatic post in Benghazi, which killed J. Christopher Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, and three other Americans, has spurred a regrettable amount of misinformation, speculation, and flat-out deceit by some in politics and the media., But Republicans, who are trying to define Clintons tenure as secretary of state around the issue, brushed off her criticisms Friday. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said the chapter showed Democrats were trying to sweep the issue under the rug and that Clinton would rather blame Republicans for asking questions than get answers for Americans. , South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, the Republican chairman of the House select committee that plans to investigate the attacks, seemed unfazed, telling CNN that there is a time and a place for everything and her book tour is neither for me. (House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has called the formation of the committee a diversionary tactic that amounts to subterfuge.) , America Rising, the super PAC conducting opposition research on Clinton in anticipation of her potential 2016 run, criticized her cherry-picked, finger pointing defense of the incident in the excerpts printed Friday. The group also challenged Clintons assertion that she shouldnt have had any reason to know about the cables requesting enhanced security at the diplomatic post in Libya, calling it a glaring failure in leadership., Clinton has repeatedly said she was responsible for the security of the diplomats in Benghazi, and she reiterates that in her new book, stating that as Secretary, I was the one ultimately responsible for my peoples safety. , But in hearings last year, Clinton said she never saw any requests for additional security in Benghazi, because those cables would have gone to lower-level deputies at the State Department. In the new book, Clinton says the fact that the cables were addressed to her was a \"procedural quirk and that they were never given to her directly: Thats not how it works. It shouldnt. And it didnt., Clinton will have many opportunities in the weeks ahead to define the incident on her own terms, as well as helpful allies to defend her tenure at the State Department. She slipped in, unannounced, for lunch with the president at the White House on Thursday. Obama praised Clinton in an interview taped the same day with\"Live! With Kelly and Michael.\" , \"I know that if she were to run for president, I think she would be very effective at that,\" Obama said in the interview, which aired Friday. (Not playing favorites, Obama lunched Friday with another potential 2016 candidate, Vice President Joe Biden.), The former secretary of state has granted a first interview about Hard Choices to ABCs Diane Sawyer that will air in a prime-time special on the eve of publication, followed by a live appearance on \"Good Morning America\" on June 10. Clinton has also agreed to an interview airing June 17 with anchors at the Fox News Channel, which has focused relentlessly on questions about the Benghazi attacks and what Clinton knew.]", "Date": "20140530", "Title": "[Hillary Clinton on offense over Benghazi as book tour approaches]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-hillary-clinton-book-benghazi-20140530-story.html", "Author": "[Maeve Reston]"}

Anyone born in the U.S. has been considered a citizen since the 14th Amendments adoption in 1868., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, Trump wants to deport all immigrants in the U.S. illegally  an estimated 11 million people  but says he wouldnt break up families because their families would be deported too., \"Were going to keep the families together ... but they have to go,\" he said in a wide-ranging interview on NBCs \"Meet the Press.\" \"We have to make a whole new set of standards. And when people come in, they have to come in legally.\", Deportees who qualify could return, he said., Trump would end Obamas Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allows young people brought to the country illegally as children to work and attend college without facing deportation., And he would require Mexico to pay for a wall along the southern border. If it refused, he would \"impound all remittance payments derived from illegal wages\" and increase fees for temporary visas and all border-crossing cards, among other measures. He did not define what he meant by illegal wages., He also wants to triple the number of immigration officers on the border and require the \"mandatory return of all criminal aliens.\", Trumps plan and comments drew immediate fire from Latino organizations and other groups, who havent forgotten the billionaire businessmans remarks when he started his campaign by saying that Mexico was sending its rapists and drug smugglers to the U.S., \"Trump has reignited the GOPs long-standing obsession with mass deportation,\" said Pablo Manriquez, the Democratic National Committees director of Latino media. \"Like his fellow GOP candidates Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Marco Rubio and others, GOP front-runner Trump dismisses a full and equal pathway to citizenship for hardworking immigrants.\", At least one of Trumps rivals responded directly to his immigration plan Sunday. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, while agreeing that a wall should be built on the border, told CBS \"Face the Nation\" that he supported a guest-worker program as a way to offer legal status to immigrants in the country illegally so long as they didnt have a criminal record., On other controversial topics, Trump told NBC that his views on abortion had evolved, and that he now opposed abortion except in cases of rape, incest and when the mothers life was at risk., He said Planned Parenthood, which has been sharply criticized after the release of undercover videos about how it handles the donation of fetal tissue, \"has to stop with the abortions.\" Asked whether he had donated to Planned Parenthood, Trump said he wasnt sure. \"I dont think so, but its possible,\" he said, noting that he has given to many organizations over the years., However, he hesitated when asked whether he would support shutting down the government to defund Planned Parenthood, as some Republicans advocate., As president, Trump said he would ask Supreme Court nominees about their views on abortion  something that hasnt been the norm, even though nominees are carefully vetted on this and other divisive issues behind the scenes. Trump said: \"I think it would be, if not a litmus test, it would certainly be helpful in terms of my choices.\", Trump is a less orthodox conservative on some other social issues. He said he supported affirmative action and gay rights, for example., \"Im fine with affirmative action. Weve lived with it for a long time. And I lived with it for a long time. And Ive had great relationships with lots of people,\" he said., When asked whether private companies should be allowed to fire a person because he or she is gay, Trump said he didnt think that should be a reason., On foreign policy, Trump wants other countries to pay the U.S. for policing the world. Saudi Arabia \"wouldnt be there\" if it werent for U.S. protection, he said. He questioned why Germany wasnt doing more to lead NATOs charge in Ukraine. And then theres Americas defense of South Korea against the rogue state of North Korea. \"We get nothing for this,\" he said., Trump said he wanted to defeat Islamic State militants \"by taking over a lot of the oil and certain areas of Iraq. And I said you take away their wealth, that you go and knock the hell out of the oil, take back the oil ... which we should have done in the first place.\", When asked about sending U.S. ground troops to do that, Trump said, \"Thats OK.\", As for the Iran nuclear pact, Trump told NBC it would be \"very hard to say were ripping [it] up.\", \"But let me tell you, but I will police that deal,\" he said. \"You know, Ive taken over some bad contracts. ...

{"Content": "[[, If Donald Trump were running against Bernie Sanders in the general election next year, Americans would face a choice between an unabashed capitalist and an enthusiastic socialist. One candidate would rail against the power of the billionaire class, while the other once said that part of the beauty of me is that I am very rich., On many levels, the contrast between the two candidates in this hypothetical  and highly unlikely  matchupwould be stark. But its what they have in common thats made them the men with the momentum this summer., Both Trump, the real estate tycoon, and Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, are tapping into anti-establishment, pro-outsider sentiment that is emerging as a potent force early in the campaign cycle. Years of dissatisfaction with Washington leaders, along with a thirst for authenticity in politics, is leading voters to at least contemplate something different this year  dramatically different., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, While the primary races are still six months from any ballot being cast, the first phase has become the \"disrupter\" summer, where candidates who promise to upend the system are rising fast and those promising merely to fix it seem stuck., The long, hot trend was unavoidable over the last week as Sanders, who is seeking the Democratic nomination, drew a total of 60,000 people to rallies in Seattle, Portland, Ore., and Los Angeles, and for a second week appeared to be very close in polls with Hillary Rodham Clinton in New Hampshire. Trump, meanwhile, managed to again defy punditry by holding his lead in the race for the Republican nomination after he made comments that would have killed another candidacy., Pollsters caution against making too much of early polls influenced heavily by name recognition, media attention and, on the GOP side, considerable voter indecision., Still, some conditions are ripe for outbursts of anti-establishment sentiment, particularly among Republicans. Along with continued low marks for government institutions and lukewarm feelings about the economy, Americans dont think much of the two parties. The GOPs approval rating sunk to 32% in a recent Pew Research survey, one of the lowest numbers in more than two decades, said Carroll Doherty, director of political research for the organization., One of the main reasons for that is that Republicans themselves are giving the party relatively low ratings, including the party leaders in Congress, he said. You see a real restiveness among Republicans, and its clearly having an impact in the presidential campaign., And while displeasure with Capitol Hill is not new, the number of Republicans viewing their party favorably has plummeted in just the last six months, from 86% to 68% in the Pew survey this month., Both campaigns acknowledge  albeit somewhat reluctantly  that they share common undercurrents., On the one hand, I find the comparison preposterous, said Tad Devine, a longtime Democratic strategist and Sanders advisor. Aside from some similar-sounding populist rhetoric on trade and on campaign finance, the two mens views are diametrically opposed., On the other hand, I understand why people are looking for some commonality to whats going on. I think theyre both candidates who are cutting through the typical back-and-forth of politics.  Theres this recognition on the part of voters that this is a guy who says exactly what hes thinking at the moment., I think with Trump, too, people believe that theyre hearing what hes thinking. For voters who are used to canned responses, teleprompter speeches and things that are much more packaged, I think thats refreshing., Trump, speaking this week on MSNBCs Morning Joe, also noted the similarities., Hes struck a nerve on the other side and Ive struck, I think, an even bigger nerve on the Republican side, the conservative side. Its amazing, he said., Other candidates are also amazed  and looking for a way to hit the same nerve, no matter how unlikely their chances of posing as unpolished outsiders. Several have labeled themselves disrupters, borrowing a word once in vogue to describe Silicon Valley innovators., Last month, Jeb Bush, arguably the Republican with the most establishment backing in the race, declared he was running to disrupt the established order, change the culture and make possible the real changes that this nation needs., Clinton, as she outlined her version of Sanders critique of Wall Street, said she was looking for new creative, innovative, disruptive ideas that will save capitalism for the 21st century., Meanwhile, candidates who were once viewed as the bomb throwers in the race have turned to calling out the others. Republican Sen. Rand Paul held a conference call with reporters this week in which he decried Trump as a phony and a an empty suit full of bravado but not anything meaningful for the country. He followed up with a video casting Trump as a closeted Democrat., His campaign argues that Rand is the disrupter who can get elected., Most disrupters today in the news are heavily lagging behind Hillary Clinton. Sen. Paul is an outsider taking on the Washington machine, but hes literally the most electable\" against Clinton, said Paul spokesman Sergio Gor., Indeed, even as voters have been drawn to both Trump and Sanders it is not because they believe these men will win. In a Franklin Pierce University-Boston Herald poll released this week, 37% of GOP voters said they believed Bush would win the nomination, compared with 16% who thought Trump would win. Among Trump backers, none said they supported him because he has the best chance of winning the general election, but 45% said they backed him because he would lead in a new direction. Three-quarters of the likely Republican voters surveyed said they could change their minds., On the Democratic side, too, even as Sanders support has risen, most voters told pollsters they still viewed Clinton as the likely nominee., Electability isnt the only thing that may eventually take the steam out of the disrupters rise. Some argue that while many voters say they are looking for someone to shake things up, when pollsters drill for specifics, voters say they are looking for more than that., When they talk about an outsider, what theyre really looking for is a problem-solver, said one GOP candidates strategist who asked not to be name discussing the campaigns thinking. That means candidates with experience passing reforms and governing  the bevy of governors past or present in the GOP race  may fare better if they can get their message to voters, the strategist said., But that will mean cutting through the buzz behind Sanders and Trump. Googles tracking of the most-searched presidential candidate recently found Sanders on top in Vermont, Oregon and Washington. Trump prevailed in the other 47 states., For more campaign-trailcoverage, follow @khennessey, MORE ON THE 2016 CAMPAIGN:, In Jeb Bushs foreign policy speech, George W.

{"Content": "[[, If I were Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray, I might be rethinking my retirement plans., Cordray is only 55, so itll be a few years before the AARP inundates him with solicitations. But he may be the last director to win confirmation for quite some time, if Republicans take and hold the Senate while Democrats occupy the White House., The Supreme Courts decision Thursday on recess appointments barred the president  correctly, in the view of The Times editorial board  from taking advantage of Congress weekend breaks to usher appointees into office without the required Senate confirmation. According to the court, the presidents recess appointment power can be used only during an honest-to-goodness recess, which history suggests would be a break of at least 10 days., The ruling stops gamesmanship by the White House but not by members of Congress. And thats where things get interesting. The result could be a shift in the balance of power in divided government, with the White House losing some of its leverage in negotiations with the Senate., To understand the implications of the ruling, it helps to look at recent history., After they won control of the Senate during President George W. Bushs second term, Democrats came up with the seemed-like-a-good-idea-at-the-time innovation of convening bogus (or more technically, \"pro forma\") sessions to prevent the body from going into recess even though all but a handful of its members had left the Capitol. That stopped Bush from making recess appointments in his final two years., When President Obama took office, he had a filibuster-proof majority of Democrats and sympathetic independents in the Senate. So recess appointments were a nonissue until Democrats lost the special election in 2010 to replace the late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, at which point Republicans could filibuster effectively  which they did., After Republicans took the House in 2010, they upped the ante with another seemed-like-a-good-idea-at-the-time tactic: remaining in session every day, even when no votes were scheduled, to keep the Senate from going on recess. The only breaks were short ones for weekends and holidays, which Republicans believed would be too abbreviated to allow a recess appointment. Obama disagreed, appointing Cordray and three members of the National Labor Relations Board during one such break in January 2012., Two appeals courts ruled the NLRB appointments illegal in 2013. Recognizing the writing on the wall, Democrats took the logical next step, voting to change Senate rules and bar filibusters on nominees for the executive branch and judgeships below the Supreme Court. This move eliminated the need for recess appointments when the White House and the Senate are controlled by the same party., Thats not likely to persist for long. Chances are good that Republicans will retake the Senate after Novembers elections. Make that better than good, considering that Nate Silver continues to predict a (narrow) GOP majority come January 2015., That means two years of pro forma sessions and few confirmations, particularly not for agencies that Republicans are determined to rein in or even neuter. That would include the NLRB and the CFPB., If Republicans want to cripple the NLRB, they merely have to run out the clock on the current board members terms; one expires in August 2016, the other four expire two years after that. Without a quorum of three members, the board cant act. The agencys regional directors would continue deciding cases (for example, one of them granted Northwestern Universitys football players the right to unionize), but the NLRB would cease to exist as a policymaking body., Proponents of recess appointments had cited this possibility as a rationale for giving the president an escape valve. But Thursdays ruling, combined with the tactics introduced by Senate Democrats and House Republicans, close off that valve. If theres a Democratic president in 2017 and a Republican Senate, the former would appear to be at the latters mercy when it comes to filling the NLRBs vacancies., Meanwhile, Republicans oppose the CFPB in a fundamental way, objecting to the wide latitude that the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act gave the bureau to adopt and enforce its rules. In exchange for allowing a vote on Cordrays nomination, they wanted Congress to put the bureau under the direct control of other federal bank regulators and made its budget subject to annual appropriations  two moves that consumer advocates said would leave the bureau toothless., A compromise designed to preserve the filibuster rule allowed the Senate to vote on Cordrays appointment in 2013 without defanging the CFPB. Although his five-year term expires in 2018, the law allows the director to continue serving until a successor is confirmed. With the bureau unable to adopt new rules without a director, Cordray may want to stay on as long as the White House needs to find a replacement the Senate will accept. Otherwise, the president may have little choice but to agree to the changes Republicans seek in the CFPBs governance., Again, these issues would arise only with the White House and the Senate being held by different parties.

{"Content": "[[, If theres a by-the-book way to run for president, Martin OMalley seems to have followed it to the letter., The liberal Democrat and former Maryland governor has been a frequent visitor to Iowa and New Hampshire, which will cast the first votes of the 2016 campaign. Hes a polished performer on the political chat-show circuit. Hes issued a sheaf of painstakingly detailed policy briefs, winning applause from the partys left-leaning interest groups., And yet for all of that, OMalley is mired at a near-subterranean level in opinion polls, with support in the 1% to 3% range that, for all intents, amounts to little more than a rounding error., Worse, the scant bit of attention paid to any Democratic presidential hopeful not named HillaryRodhamClinton has been devoted to Bernie Sanders, Vermonts rumpled senator and a conduit for the restiveness pulsing among a legion of progressive activists., OMalley insists its not the least bit concerning., It would be if I hadnt been to this rodeo before, he said Thursday during a two-day fund-raising swing through California. Ive seen candidates of substance and experience commit themselves to the long-haul marathon and campaign the way you have to campaign to succeed in the Iowa caucuses., He was referring to Gary Hart, the Democrat who played the role of handsome-face-of-a-new-generation back in 1984, laboring for months as an asterisk in polls until he placed an unexpectedly strong second in Iowa. That catapulted him into a fierce national race against the overwhelming establishment front-runner, Walter F. Mondale. OMalley, 52, was a young foot soldier in Harts Iowa campaign., So having seen that before, its a little easier for me to have the faith to walk across these months, a conspicuously jet-lagged OMalley said as he gripped a paper cup from Starbucks., His strategy goes back once more to the familiar campaign playbook, specifically the pages labeled long-shot/underdog., OMalley is focused on winning Iowa and New Hampshire voters one by one, at diners and small dinners, in living rooms and church basements., He assails Democratic leaders for allegedly stacking the nominating process in Clintons favor, throwing out words like coronation that play to resentment over the front-runners perceived sense of entitlement. He insists, with increasing asperity, that the half-dozen debates sanctioned by the national party arent enough, joining Sanders in demanding more., He accuses Clinton cordially, for the most partof stinting on policy and ducking controversial issues, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade deal and construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.OMalley opposes both., In fact, the former governor has issued a veritable blizzard of white papers: on immigrationhe would extend citizenship to millions of undocumented immigrants in political and administrative limbo; financial reformhe would cap the size of the nations biggest banks; criminal justicehe would phase out the for-profit prison industry; and the environmenthe calls for a 100% clean-energy economy by 2055., The difference from other Democrats, OMalley says repeatedly, is his unmatched executive experience as Baltimore mayor, from December 1999 to January 2007, followed by eight years as Maryland governor., Not only do I make progressive promises, but Im the only candidate in our field whos actually accomplished progressive things, progressive results, he told reporters after participating in a high-minded panel discussion on tech and civic engagement., As governor, he showed a wonky passion for statistics-driven policyusing number-crunching formulas to fight crime, tame Marylands bureaucracy and clean up Chesapeake Bay and compiled a record of unswerving liberal activism: raising taxes on the states wealthiest residents, banishing the death penalty, toughening gun laws, raising the minimum wage and approving same-sex marriage., OMalleys eager to discuss all of that and more on a debate stage, face to face with Clinton, at the first party-sanctioned forumOct. 13in Las Vegas., Lets hope they dont put it in an undisclosed hangar in Area 51, he said, dryly., Follow@markzbarabak for national and California politics]", "Date": "20150821", "Title": "[Far down in polls, Martin O'Malley says, 'What, me worry?']", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-omalley-2016-20150821-story.html", "Author": "[Mark Z.

{"Content": "[[, If you were plotting the epicenter of a daring trend or gathering the vanguard for a revolutionary charge, San Benito County might not be the first place youd start., One of the states smallest counties, its a retro snapshot of turn-of-the-century rural California: agrarian, stoic, striving., But after a stunning election victory, residents of this farming region find themselves on the sharp edge of a growing movement to ban hydraulic fracturing via local voter initiatives., Fracking opponents here were vastly outspent by oil companies that fought a measure to ban well stimulation techniques such as fracking, acidizing and steam injection, along with conventional drilling in some areas. With just $130,000, the homegrown campaign managed to draw 57% of San Benito County voters to the polls in a low-excitement midterm election. They held off oil companies that spent nearly $2 million opposing the initiative., \"This little, tiny county managed to give big oil a black eye,\" said Kate Woods, a local landowner who supported the ban, which takes effect Jan. 1. \"This is going to be something that spreads.\", Some would argue it already is spreading. Mendocino County approved a fracking ban earlier this month. And in Santa Barbara, opponents of a ban poured $6 million into a successful effort that turned back a similar initiative., The bare-knuckle campaign in San Benito County opened divisions here, pitting neighbors and friends against one another. Election shenanigans reportedly ranged from midnight runs to tear down opponents signs to alleged voter intimidation and physical altercations., Supporters of the ban said energy industrialization would indelibly alter the regions bucolic way of life and imperil water sources., Opponents argued that fracking wasnt even occurring in the county, and they worried that outlawing other extraction techniques would forever restrict economic growth in the financially depressed county., Despite pending state fracking regulations that California officials say are the nations toughest, analysts expect other municipalities to fashion their own rules under the framework of zoning. Santa Cruz County already has a ban, as does Beverly Hills. The L.A. City Council approved a moratorium on fracking but has yet to draft an ordinance., A measure banning fracking in the city of La Habra Heights has qualified for the March 2015 ballot, and Butte County will take up the question in the 2016 elections., The strategy of outlawing fracking by enacting local ordinances has been working its way west from New York, where 200 local governments in the midst of a shale oil and gas boom have instituted bans. This month, Denton, Texas  the birthplace of hydraulic fracturing  imposed a ban on the practice inside city limits, as did Athens, Ohio., Supporters of the ban in San Benito and elsewhere cast it as an issue of self-determination., \"Im concerned about quality-of-life issues,\" said Robert Rivas, a county supervisor. \"We need to be in control of our growth, not the oil and gas industry.\", Some energy companies, though, consider the spate of ordinances an annoying fad. Craig Moyer, a lawyer with Manatt, Phelps & Phillips and counsel for the California Independent Petroleum Assn., said the initiatives are unnecessary because of comprehensive fracking regulations that lawmakers approved earlier this year, which are expected to be fully implemented in 2015., \"The state has addressed it,\" Moyer said. \"Im kind of amazed that it has gotten to be as much of an issue as it has. Im hopeful that it will fade away and people will move on.\", Judging by the passions still roiling here, there seems little chance of that., ::, San Benito County is on the edge of alluring places  the lush Monterey Peninsula is 40 miles to the west, and the wealth centers of San Francisco Bay and Silicon Valley are little more than an hours drive north. , But the rural way of life perseveres here. More than 80% of land in the county is devoted to farming or ranching, numbers that have held steady even as subdivisions spill across the town of Hollister and big-box stores crowd out local shops., The county, home to 56,000 residents, sees its future in agritourism driven by destination wineries, organic farms and quaint inns overlooking pasturing cattle. Bustling oil and gas operations dont fit in the picture., In the 1950s, hundreds of pump jacks and drilling rigs dotted this rolling landscape that sits astride the Monterey Shale formation. Today, fewer than 50 are operating, and only two companies are actively seeking to explore., The Farm Bureau recently commissioned an analysis of the economic benefits to the county from the energy industry. At the moment, San Benito Countys annual tax revenue from oil operations totals $1,162., Those revenues could have skyrocketed if energy companies resurrected old wells by employing modern well stimulation methods: fracking, injecting a slurry of water and chemicals into subterranean formations to free oil and gas; acidizing, shooting a mix of highly caustic chemicals down a well bore to dissolve rock or other debris; and cyclic steam injection, pumping superheated steam into underground seams to loosen and liquefy viscous crude oil., Concerns about Citadel Explorations \"Project Indian\" steam injection well near Pinnacles National Park prompted the San Benito ballot measure. The exploratory well went in on a working ranch where the mineral rights were held by Occidental Petroleum., Newport Beach-based Citadel leased the site from Occidental, and the county approved the work. The Center for Biological Diversity sued, alleging there was insufficient environmental review and bringing work at the site to a halt., Armin Nahabedian, Citadels CEO and a fourth-generation oil driller, lashed out against the ban, known as Measure J, and at \"outsiders,\" who he said were agitating county residents., \"In a fair world, these people would be dragged out into the courtyard and dealt with accordingly,\" Nahabedian told the Santa Cruz Sentinel newspaper. \"These people are stirring up a lot of bad publicity, and theyre causing some decisions to be made by using tactics of fear-mongering.\", The countys Farm Bureau and Cattlemens Assn. called the ban unnecessary, extreme and \"hatched by activists and lawyers from outside San Benito to serve their own political agendas.\", In what became a superheated campaign, ban supporters were called \"jihadists\" and environmental extremists., One Hollister man detected a more nefarious agenda behind the ban, concluding in a letter to the local newspaper that a vote for the measure was a vote for terrorism., \"If Measure J passes, jobs will be lost, people will suffer, and revenue to the county and to the state will be reduced. Further, ISIS will revel in the knowledge that they have achieved a foothold in their quest for additional funds to do their dirty work,\" wrote Philip Schipsi. , Nahabedian of Citadel Exploration declined an interview request but in an email statement said he considered the ordinance an illegal \"taking\" that prevents him from using his property. Three days after the election, Nahabedian sent a letter to county supervisors demanding $1.2 billion in restitution for loss of future income he could have derived from the land., Supporters of the ban rejected the notion that their campaign was led by interlopers from outside San Benito County. The real outsiders, they said, were the oil companies fighting the ban. The campaign was successful, locals said, because it was spearheaded by teachers, farmers and ranchers with roots in the community., Third-generation cattle rancher Joe Morris is a longtime member of the Farm Bureau, the Cattlemens Assn. and the Chamber of Commerce. He split with all those groups in his support of Measure J., \"They were pounding away with lie after lie after lie about the initiative itself. That seemed unconscionable,\" Morris said., Paul Hain, an organic farmer and a Republican, said he has been in the Farm Bureau for years, but he didnt agree with its support for drilling. \"I told the board, You guys are a bunch of stooges for big oil. Im not real popular right now. They hitched their horse to the wrong wagon here.\", Catherine Engberg, a San Francisco lawyer who had a hand in crafting Measure J, said she will be surprised if it isnt challenged in court. But she doesnt think those lawsuits will be successful., If this is the template for how future anti-fracking campaigns play out across California, local officials here warn that other counties should prepare for battle., \"We are not going to be pushed around by oil companies,\" said County Supervisor Anthony Botelho, a Republican. \"The fights just begun.\", julie.cart@latimes.com, @julie_cart]", "Date": "20141129", "Title": "[Election win puts rural San Benito County on anti-fracking map]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-san-benito-fracking-20141129-story.html", "Author": "[Julie Cart]"}

Colorado and Washington mellowed., Vladimir Putin rebuilt the Russian Empire and almost got named Man of the Year., No one came up with a single useful clue to the fate of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 or to what Donald Sterling could possibly have been thinking., By years end, 2014 seemed to be summed up in a collective national utterance: \"I cant breathe.\", Some of the years highlights, and a look at whats ahead:, POLITICS: Congress suffered through its least-productive session since the 1940s, enacting only 296 laws, and just one in six Americans could say that they were happy with the institution. With control of both chambers starting in January, Republicans will have to prove that they can make the federal government work better. In Iowa, New Hampshire and other early voting states, a dozen or so contenders will step up to the race to succeed President Obama, with Hillary Clinton the prohibitive Democrat front-runner and Republicans scrambling in a wide-open bid for their nomination., POLICE SHOOTINGS: Michael Brown, a young unarmed black man, was shot to death by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., on Aug. 9, triggering a cascade of protests across the country. Similar demonstrations erupted from the death of another black man, Eric Garner, caught in a grappling hold by New York police in July. \"I cant breathe!\" Garner gasped as he died. Grand juries in both cases elected not to indict and in the swirling public outrage, what many have called a new civil rights movement was born. The backlash soon turned violent: Two New York police officers were shot to death Dec. 20 by a man who invoked Garners name in anti-police messages he had posted online. In the coming year, the Justice Department will complete its investigations into whether any civil rights laws were broken., CONFLICT ABROAD: It was a year of violence on Earth, ill will toward man. This was especially true in the Middle East, where the Syrian civil war by the end of the year had claimed more than 190,000 lives, displaced 6.5 million people and forced 3 million more to flee the country  with no end in sight for a resolution. Terrorism was directed to an astonishing degree at children; more than 145 students and teachers died in an attack Dec. 16 by the Pakistani Taliban on an Army school in Pakistan. Islamist militants waged similar attacks at schools in Nigeria while also kidnapping hundreds of girls. Girls struck back: Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani schoolgirl shot by the Pakistani Taliban, became an activist for female education and won the Nobel Peace Prize. The United States continued to unwind its military role in Afghanistan, though new troops were dispatched to Iraq, and the use of drones continued to rise. At years end, the U.S. moved to reopen relations with Cuba after a cutoff of more than 50 years., EBOLA: The West finally had to deal with Ebola, which has killed more than 7,500 people in Africa in the current, and worst, outbreak in history. The virus spread panic in parts of the United States where a handful of cases were diagnosed among travelers and healthcare workers who did not have the proper protection. But the numbers were far short of the 1.4 million cases some had projected by years end. The outbreak will be contained, health officials continue to say, but they wont say when. Expect further flare-ups across West Africa in 2015, and additional cases in the U.S. too. \"Im hopeful about stopping the epidemic, but this is going to be a long, hard fight,\" said Thomas Frieden, head of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., TECHNOLOGY AND HACKTIVISM: Internet usage on mobile devices exceeded personal computer usage for the first time. As of January 2014, 90% of American adults had a cellphone and 58% had a smartphone. Polls found that 67% of adults said they found themselves checking their phone for messages, alerts, or calls  even when they dont notice their phone ringing or vibrating. It was the year when Jennifer Lawrence and Sony Pictures Entertainment went naked  neither by choice. Lawrences nude photos were stolen by hackers and Sonys deepest secrets were uncovered and made public by other computer guerrillas purportedly furious over the movie \"The Interview,\" which imagines a plot to kill the leader of North Korea. The FBI accused North Korea of being responsible for the attack that embarrassingly disgorged private details about employees, former workers, top officials and even A-listers like Angelina Jolie. Next year, expect what Obama has vowed will be a \"proportional\" response., BORDER SURGE: Tens of thousands of new immigrants, a large number of them children, flooded across the Southwest border. Many were fleeing violence in Central America, many also were hoping for a chance at legal residence in the U.S. Shelters were inundated and the immigration courts were overwhelmed. \"Si se puede,\" the slogan made famous by Cesar Chavez in his fasts on behalf of farmworkers, returned as the watchword for those seeking comprehensive immigration reform. But as hopes for congressional action waned, Obama announced in November that he was taking executive action in a controversial move to protect more than 4 million undocumented immigrants from being deported. At least 24 states sued, arguing that the president had overstepped his authority., SAME-SEX MARRIAGE: If race and ethnic relations were under pressure in 2014, it was nothing like the changes wrought by the evolution in same-sex marriage laws. For the first time, a majority of Americans were living someplace where marriage between partners of the same sex was legal, either through legislation or court action. By the end of the year, 35 states and the District of Columbia had legalized gay marriage and the rest were somewhere in the legal process. The issue is expected to go to the U.S. Supreme Court next year as it tries to resolve a split in the lower courts., OBAMACARE: The presidents signature domestic achievement, the Affordable Care and Patient Protection Act, enters its second year facing a surprising Supreme Court test. The court next year will hear oral arguments in the suit  King vs. Burwell  that alleges the Internal Revenue Service acted improperly in how it set up regulations for subsidies that are important for how the program works. Conservatives, continuing their campaign to try to reverse Obamacare, argue that Congress only allowed for subsidies on state-run exchanges, while the regulations as written allow subsidies for both state-run and federal exchanges. Meanwhile, the latest government figures show that 6.4 million people signed up for Obamacare next year, far better than a year ago, when computer glitches weighed heavily on rollout. Of the current enrollees, 1.9 million are new customers. The Obama administrations goal for 2015 is to get 9.1 million customers in plans sold under the law.]", "Date": "20141225", "Title": "[The U.S. is ending 2014 with a collective 'I can't breathe']", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-year-ahead-opener-20141226-story.html", "Author": "[Michael Muskal]"}
{"Content": "[[, Illegal immigration is always a sizzling topic on Tony Beams conservative call-in radio show in this small Bible Belt city., \"Usually all I have to do is say the word and the phones start ringing,\" Beam said. Sure enough, the lines lighted up on a recent morning when he mentioned a proposal by Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson to offer work permits to immigrants in the country illegally., \"You have to deport them,\" seethed a caller named Alex, who dubbed Carsons proposal weak. \"Theyre changing our country.\", As Wednesday nights debate showed, such hard-line views among conservative voters have created a stark divide among GOP presidential candidates, most of whom will head here Friday for a forum sponsored by the conservative group Heritage Action., Many Republican leaders had moved to the right on immigration even before Donald Trump made the issue the centerpiece of his campaign. Those who opt for more moderate approaches have faced backlash from the party base., But while Republicans must answer to far-right voters now, they also face a future electoral force  one just coming into focus in parts of Greenville, a city of about 60,000 nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains., In some neighborhoods here, strip malls have been transformed by cafes, carnicerias (meat markets) and hair salons catering to the regions rapidly growing Latino population, which increased 866% between 1990 and 2013., South Carolinas upstate region, where Greenville is located, is a microcosm of the dramatic demographic shift happening across the country, where an estimated 28 million Latinos will be eligible to vote in next years presidential election., Although Latinos here and elsewhere share many conservative social values with Republicans, their support for a fix to an immigration system widely viewed as broken is in conflict with a conservative constituency that largely opposes citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally. How Republicans negotiate the competing pressures could determine the outcome of the partys primary and the 2016 general election., The conflict was visible during the Republican debate, in which Carson, Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio cautiously sought to put some distance between the harsh immigration proposals that have dominated Trumps presidential campaign and their own softer approaches., \"I want to build a wall  a wall that works,\" said Trump, who has called for mass deportations and vowed to stop issuing birthright citizenship to children born to mothers in the country without legal status., \"To build a wall, and to deport people ... would cost hundreds of billions of dollars,\" Bush countered. \"It would destroy community life; it would tear families apart.\", It was the kind of overture that Republicans like the Rev. Jim Goodroe, the missions director for a network of Southern Baptist churches in upstate South Carolina, would like to hear more of., \"The Republican Party cannot continue to be seen as anti-Hispanic, or itll eventually be voted out of here,\" said Goodroe, whose network includes dozens of Latino churches and who supports a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally., But moderate proposals on immigration  including Bushs plan to offer legal status but not citizenship to many in the U.S. illegally  turn off conservative party activists like Kerry Wood, who helped found a tea party group in nearby Spartanburg., \"If somebodys not willing to support our border, theres no way Im voting for them,\" said Wood, who is leaning toward voting for Trump in South Carolinas important early primary in March., Wood, who supported a state law that allowed police officers to check the immigration status of people they stopped, said conservatives wouldnt need to worry about the Latino vote if they took a stronger position on immigration. \"If they were to give the base what they wanted, theyd turn out in huge numbers,\" Wood said., After Republican nominee Mitt Romney lost the 2012 election to President Obama, Republican leaders wrote a postmortem that called for broadening the partys appeal to Latinos, many of whom are religious and embrace conservative social beliefs., In upstate South Carolina, where many Latinos speak English with a Southern drawl, both parties have reached out to Latino leaders about grooming future candidates, even though Latinos still make up only 2% of the states eligible voters. But polls show Republicans intransigence on immigration has turned many Latinos away from the GOP., Its a dilemma faced by 28-year-old Eric Guerrero. An evangelical Christian who plays the guitar at a weekly Spanish-language worship service, Guerrero says he shares many Republican values. He voted for John McCain in 2008 and Romney in 2012 largely because he disagrees with Democrats on abortion and gay marriage., But Trumps anti-immigrant rhetoric this summer has Guerrero, who was born in Mexico and became a U.S. citizen as a teenager, in a state of limbo., \"I have family who is not legal,\" he said. \"Its hard if youre Hispanic, because you dont want to go against your people.\", Ivan Segura, president of the Council of Mexicans in the Carolinas, an advocacy group, says he believes immigrants are being scapegoated by Republicans like Trump in order to win votes., \"Theyre trying to secure their base, even if that means theyre going to have to get out and make the immigrants look like the devil,\" Segura said., In this conservative part of the country, where as of this summer the Confederate flag no longer flies outside the State House but \"American-owned\" signs hang in store windows, anyone seen as sympathetic to immigrants in the country without legal status faces potential blowback., Just ask Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina senator and presidential candidate who faced six challengers for his reelection last year and taunts of \"Grahamnesty\" after he helped write a bill that would have provided a path to citizenship for some of those in the country illegally., \"Theres definitely anxiety,\" said Beam, the conservative talk show host. \"Hispanics coming into America are willing to work for less and Americans are threatened by that.\", But, as Beam acknowledged, Latinos are a demographic that Republicans may not be able to ignore, with some 800,000 Latinos turning 18 every year. \"If we end up as a political party with single digits of the Hispanic vote ... going forward, thats going to have a huge impact on electability,\" he said., Yolanda Pardo, a legal permanent resident from Colombia who runs a small store in Greenville, one of 6,000 Latino-owned businesses in the state, said her 17-year-old U.S. citizen daughter will be eligible to vote for the first time next year., \"Shes already said shes voting for Hillary,\" said Pardo, who hopes to become a naturalized citizen so she can also vote for Clinton, the Democratic front-runner., Although Latinos may not have the ear of candidates now, that will change in time, she said: \"Were going to have a bigger voice.\"]", "Date": "20150918", "Title": "[GOP's immigration dilemma comes to South Carolina: Hard line now may cost Latino votes later]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-latinos-gop-20150918-story.html", "Author": "[Kate Linthicum]"}

{"Content": "[[, Im Davan Maharaj, editor of the Los Angeles Times. Uber and the sharing economy emerge as a rallying cry for Republican candidates; and the death penalty bumps up against governors who wont sign execution warrants. Here are some story lines I dont want you to miss today., #mailchimp-subscribe { font:14px Georgia,Serif; line-height: 30px;}, TOP STORIES, An Uber Election, Republican candidates are jumping on Uber, and not just for rides to the airport. The sharing economy is becoming a campaign issue.Republicans almost universally embrace the use of apps for renting drivers, apartments and most anything else. Democrats are loath to seem anti-tech, but theyve got a problem: Traditional worker rights and upstarts like Uber dont always mesh., The Dying Death Penalty, The death penalty is in retreat. Juries still hand it down, but the number of executions has plummeted. Moreover, four governors simply have said they wont sign death warrants. Among them is John Hickenlooper of Colorado, where James Holmes was just convicted of murder in the Aurora theater massacre. That raises some tough questions as his trial enters the penalty phase., Maximizing the Minimum, County Supervisors voted 3-2 to join L.A. in raising the hourly minimum wage to $15.There was backslapping and talk of \"fair wages\" and a win for the working poor.

{"Content": "[[, Imagine three presidents. The first sold a moderate message to win a three-way race with 49% of the vote. The second sold a conservative one and won with just under 51% of the vote. And the third ran a liberal campaign and won with just over 51% of the vote., Of the three presidents, who had the broad campaign of wide appeal? And who had the narrow one of partisan mobilization?, If you know your politics, you know these campaigns. The first is Bill Clintons 1996 run, the second is George W. Bushs in 2004, and the third is Barack Obamas 2012 reelection bid. And of them, Obamas was the most successful: Not only did he win an outright majority, but he won the most votes  as a share of the total  in a presidential election since George H.W. Bush, and became the first Democratic president since Franklin Roosevelt to win two national majorities., Looking to 2016, Hillary Rodham Clinton wants to achieve what Obama did, and so shes running a version of his campaign, openly appealing to the groups that supported him. In the last two months, shes endorsed criminal justice reform, pushed expansive immigration reform and called for an overhaul of voting laws to improve access., But Washington pundits, and mainstream reporters, are disturbed. Hillary Rodham Clinton appears to be dispensing with the nationwide electoral strategy that won her husband two terms in the White House and brought white working-class voters and great stretches of what is now red-state America back to Democrats, wrote Jonathan Martin and Maggie Haberman of the New York Times., My problem with this approach, wrote Ron Fournier of National Journal, of Clintons strategy, is that it works only until election day, when a polarizing, opportunistic candidate assumes the presidency with no standing to convert campaign promises into results., Likewise, again in the New York Times, David Brooks bemoaned the Clinton approach as bad for the country. If Clinton decides to be just another unimaginative base-mobilizing politician, she will make our broken politics even worse, he argued., Each critique comes to the same place: Mobilizing individual groups, instead of using a broad message, will polarize the country, make it harder to win, and make it harder to govern. But this argument has a problem: reality., Despite his inclusive, centrist message, Bill Clinton never won a majority of the vote. And when he entered office in 1993, he faced a polarized Republican minority that blocked his core programs, from a small stimulus package to healthcare reform., At no point did this change; instead, Clinton abandoned liberal legislation and co-opted Republican ideas, softening them for Democrats. Arguably, Republicans never accepted Clintons presidency; its why a sex scandal culminated in the first impeachment proceedings since the 1860s., This same dynamic was at work in 2009, after Barack Obama won 53% of the vote with an inspirational campaign of post-partisan change. Despite his huge vote totals, Republicans refused to work with him, rejecting the stimulus package (and any negotiations over its substance), abstaining from the healthcare debate (and any negotiations over its substance), and openly pledging constant opposition., The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president, said Sen. Mitch McConnell, ahead of the midterm election in 2010. In 2011, after the GOP landslide, McConnell  and John A. Boehner in the House of Representatives  would try to make good on the promise, slowing Congress to a halt and forcing confrontations over routine measures, such as lifting the debt ceiling., Obama was only able to accomplish what he did in his first two years because of the large Democratic majorities in the House and Senate. , Liberal mobilization, part of Obamas strategy, had worked. Indeed, it worked again in 2012 and 2013, when Democrats energized their voters, reelected Obama, elected a larger Senate majority, and made headway on appointments and executive branch actions the following year., Beyond the facts of this Democratic administration and the last one, the biggest blow to the argument over Hillary Clintons narrow campaign comes from public opinion. , Since 2000, Americans have moved to the left on gay rights, immigration, climate change, and criminal justice  issues on which Clinton is allegedly polarizing the public., If Washington pundits cant see that, its because theyre looking in the wrong place. The rural and suburban whites who brought Bill Clinton to victory in 1992 and 1996 arent the center of American politics anymore. That belongs to the Latinos, African Americans, Asian Americans, single women, union members, young people and college students who gave Obama his victories., The electorate is younger and browner, and more liberal as a result. Put differently, Clinton is mobilizing the base, but shes also speaking to the center. It just looks different than it did., To insist otherwise, to describe this as narrow, is to delegitimize the Democratic majorities of 2008 and 2012 and suggest, openly, that a presidential candidate isnt broad unless he (or she) is focused on white Americans., Jamelle Bouie is a staff writer for Slate., Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion and Facebook]", "Date": "20150613", "Title": "[The changing face of centrist campaigning]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0614-bouie-clinton-appeal-20150614-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, Immigrant children who are in the country illegally would receive public healthcare coverage in California under a budget deal announced Tuesday by Gov. Jerry Brown and legislative leaders., An estimated 170,000 immigrants 18 and younger could qualify, marking another victory for advocates and lawmakers who have worked to make the state more welcoming to unauthorized residents., With this budget, were saying that immigrants matter, irrespective of who you are or where youre from, said state Senate leader Kevin de Len (D-Los Angeles)., Democratic leaders also won more money for state-funded child care, preschool and dental care as well as a boost for public universities. But they gave up other spending they wanted and acceded to Browns revenue projection, which was about $3 billion lower than theirs., The compromise  the product of what Brown described as strenuous negotiations  paves the way for a new budget to take effect July 1, the start of the next fiscal year. However, some work remains unfinished; the governor called for special legislative sessions to address road repairs and public healthcare., The expansion of healthcare coverage to qualifying immigrant children would begin in May 2016, costing $40 million in the new budget and an estimated $132 million annually after that., Sen. Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens), who had pushed for the change, described it as a modest investment that would prevent children from receiving their healthcare solely in emergency rooms., California once again paves the way while Washington, D.C., continues to create roadblocks for these communities, Lara said., The decision was denounced by Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports strict enforcement of immigration laws., This is just one more example of California paying huge bills for its continued efforts to accommodate illegal immigration, Mehlman said., It forces the taxpayers to pay money to provide healthcare that could be going to other vital needs in the state, he added. And God knows there are many vital needs going unmet in the state., The final agreement was announced a day after the Legislature approved $117.5 billion in general fund spending, $2.2 billion more than Brown wanted. Continuing talks produced a final plan of $115.4 billion, only slightly larger than the Democratic governors original proposal., A series of shuffles  such as adjusting a healthcare cost estimate, adding restrictions to a scholarship program and consolidating some administrative functions  freed up enough money for lawmakers to obtain higher funding in other areas., This is a sound and well-thought-out budget, Brown said., Under the plan, the California State University system would receive a $97-million increase and the University of California system would get an extra $25 million  two investments aimed at boosting enrollment., The blueprint has an additional $265 million  more than half of what lawmakers wanted  for preschool and state-subsidized child care. And payments to dentists who serve low-income patients would be restored to pre-recession levels at a cost of $30 million., The deal also preserves other programs sought by both Brown and lawmakers, including $380 million for an earned income tax credit that would allow the working poor to keep more of their paychecks., Other legislative proposals were jettisoned., A broader increase in payments to physicians who treat the needy didnt make the cut. Neither did a plan to allow women on public assistance to receive higher benefits if they have additional children while on welfare. California currently bars such increases., Sen. Holly J. Mitchell (D-Los Angeles), who pushed for removal of the restriction, said she was livid., I guess were in the business of picking winners and losers, she said. It seems poor people and their children always end up at the bottom., Asked how the budget deal was struck, Brown described it as a gradual unfolding of deeper understanding., He didnt say whether he had threatened to veto the Legislatures budget., I dont issue threats, Brown said. I engage in frank and honest conversations., Lawmakers are expected to vote on the agreement Friday. The special legislative sessions, which could run concurrently with the regular session, will be held later this year to address remaining issues., Brown wants to use the session on healthcare to revise and extend the states tax on managed-care plans to comply with federal regulations., Without the tax, Brown said, California would lose a sustainable source of funding for public healthcare and in-home care for low-income elderly and disabled residents., The second session would be geared toward finding new ways to pay for $59 billion in overdue road repairs. Lawmakers have discussed modifying the state gas tax or charging a new fee to fund improvements., One way or the other, were going to have to find some solutions, Brown said., Republican support would be needed to raise taxes or fees. , Senate Republican leader Robert Huff (R- San Dimas) criticized Democrats for considering such moves, saying that even though the state has a surplus, they are back to the tax well looking for more money., , Follow @chrismegerian on Twitter for more updates from Sacramento., 8:03 p.m.: This article was updated with more information throughout. , 3:21 p.m.: This article was updated to include more details about the budget agreement., The first version of this article was published at 12:21 p.m., ]", "Date": "20150616", "Title": "[California budget deal grants health coverage to children in U.S. illegally]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-pc-california-budget-deal-jerry-brown-legislature-20150616-story.html", "Author": "[Chris Megerian, Melanie Mason]"}

The American people are done with the experiment of having somebody [as president] whos never run anything before. , He was preaching to the choir. The list of potential 2016 GOP presidential candidates is dominated by governors. Alongside Christie, theres John Kasich (Ohio), Scott Walker (Wisconsin), Bobby Jindal (Louisiana), Mike Pence (Indiana) and Rick Scott (Florida). And dont forget Floridas former Gov. Jeb Bush and Arkansas ex-Gov. Mike Huckabee, who are considering presidential runs as well., But if you look across our nations whole history, its hardly clear that former governors make the best presidents. The ranks of governors-turned-presidents include not just the Roosevelts, after all, but also Grover Cleveland, Calvin Coolidge and Jimmy Carter., Governors fate during presidential elections has ebbed and flowed, reflecting shifts in how Americans think about government itself. Before the American Revolution, colonial governors were appointed by the British crown. Americans in the early republic continued to view them with suspicion: In seven of the original 13 states, governors were elected for just one-year terms., The job was certainly no steppingstone to the White House. After George Washington, the next five presidents were vice presidents or secretaries of State when they ran. When Alexis de Tocqueville came to America in the 1830s to study its democracy, one politician told him, The governor counts for absolutely nothing and is only paid $1,200!, After the Civil War, governors started to come into popular favor. In 1876, both parties nominated a governor for president. Although New York Gov. Samuel Tilden won the popular vote, Ohio Gov. Rutherford B. Hayes received the majority in the electoral college. (It was the Bush vs. Gore election of its day.) For 52 of the next 68 years, the Oval Office was occupied by former governors. State governments in the early 1900s became laboratories of democracy, as future Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis called them, experimenting with workplace safety regulation and a host of other reforms. That made state governors like Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson into much more prominent figures, who moved easily onto the national stage., But after World War II, experience in Washington came into vogue. All of our chief executives from Truman to Ford were former members of Congress, with the notable exception of ex-Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower. Amid the national security concerns of the Cold War, voters wanted their commander in chief to be someone who knew his way around the federal government., Writing in 1959, pollster Louis Harris wondered whether an ex-governor could ever win the presidency again. In a cosmic, atomic, mass-media age, governors have shrunk to  local figures, Harris wrote., But the tide would turn again in the 1970s, when the Watergate scandal soured Americans on Washington pols. At the same time the rise of modern conservatism devolved many powers to the states and made Washington, D.C. a term of derision and scorn. Starting with Carter in 1976, four of the next five presidents were former governors., Then came a U.S. senator, Barack Obama, who beat the trend. He defeated a fellow senator (John McCain) the first time around and an ex-governor (Mitt Romney) the next. His party appears likely to select another ex-senator, Hillary Rodham Clinton, to run in 2016., So despite all the GOP governors lining up to be the presidential nominee, dont be surprised if Republicans choose instead a senator with a national profile  say, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio or Rand Paul., The scope of the federal government has greatly expanded during the Obama years, in the realms of healthcare, the National Security Agency and immigration. And the more influence that the federal government exerts on voters, the more they see the advantages of a candidate from inside the Beltway. Like it or not, that makes Congress  not the statehouse  the more likely training school for our next president., Jonathan Zimmerman teaches history and education at New York University.

{"Content": "[[, In 1983, Britains Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip paid an official visit to Los Angeles. I was then a city councilman. At a reception in their honor, I noticed the Duke of Edinburgh standing alone at the other end of the hall. So I walked over to him and introduced myself. He was perplexed by my title. \"Ive met the mayor, and I know who he is,\" he said. \"Ive met the supervisors, though I dont know what they supervise. Now Ive met you councilors, and I dont understand your system of government.\", So I took a moment to explain the state-local government relationship; the state and its 58 counties; the thousands of cities within the counties; the special districts, including flood control, schools, mosquito abatement and water, to mention just a few. To which the prince, peering over his glasses, retorted, \"I now understand the genius of your system  its designed not to govern.\", For those of us who have served in California local government, no observation could be more perceptive. Trying to satisfy constitutional and legislative prescriptions in order to get anything done can be like navigating a minefield. Decades-old laws and regulations needlessly stand in the way of progress., Based on nearly 40 years of experience as an elected official in Los Angeles, Ive put together a list of suggestions on how to improve governance in the county and in the state of California., An executive, not a board, With a population of more than 10 million people and an annual budget of more than $27 billion, Los Angeles is the largest county in the United States. If it were its own state, it would be the eighth-largest  bigger than North Carolina., Yet we are constrained by an old governing structure prescribed by the California Constitution: a five-member Board of Supervisors elected from geographic districts equal in population. A five-headed executive is simply not the most efficacious way to govern a county as big as ours. Can we imagine North Carolina dispensing with its governor in favor of a five-member board?, I believe that Los Angeles County needs an elected executive who would be accountable to the entire county, not just one-fifth of it., Such an executive would institutionally speak for all of us in conjunction with the Board of Supervisors. He or she would help set the countys fiscal and policy agendas, hire and fire its department heads and run the nations largest county as the governor of the eighth-largest state should do., Achieving such a reform would require the placement of a charter amendment on the county ballot and its approval by a majority of the voters. To get this done, the civic leadership and community stakeholders must be convinced of the wisdom of such a change, and they must take the lead in promoting and sponsoring such a measure. It cant come from politicians, whose motives would be instantly questioned by voters., Let the majority rule, Another part of the status quo that cries out for change is the requirement that local taxes be approved by a two-thirds vote., In recent years, several ballot measures were narrowly defeated., Measure J, an extension of the 2008 transit tax, garnered 66.15% of the vote, falling just 15,000 votes short of the required two-thirds. A bond measure in 2002 that would have funded the seismic retrofit of some of our most iconic cultural buildings, including the Natural History Museum and the County Museum of Art, fell less than 5 percentage points short. And a measure in 2014 to fund parks and recreation facilities countywide fell short by a similar margin, garnering 63% of the vote., In most other states, a 63% majority would be considered a landslide victory. Here its a losing campaign., The notion that crucial public safety, recreation, cultural or transit investments can be held hostage by 37% of the voters is frustrating in the extreme., A more achievable threshold is in order. School bonds, for example, now require 55% for approval, and a similar threshold should be considered for measures that would fund other vital services., Any change to the two-thirds requirement would necessitate an amendment to the state Constitution. Thats not inconceivable. The Legislature has been considering placing a proposal on the 2016 ballot that would do just that., Campaign finance reform, The U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case, among others, has opened the spigot allowing unlimited special-interest money to flow into campaigns., Powerful interests can now spend vast sums to elect their preferred candidates through so-called independent expenditure committees, or I.E.s., while contributions to candidates controlled committees remain strictly limited. This puts the citizen candidate at a distinct disadvantage in his or her run for office., In local politics, as in state and national politics, candidates who are funded by these I.E.s have their message communicated to the voters via advertising, while those who are not so funded are drowned out., Moreover, when millions of dollars in I.E.s are spent to elect a legislator, a county supervisor, a mayor or city council member, politicians are expected to return the favor, and far too often they do. Indeed, the main casualty of these court decisions has been political independence., Neither the Supreme Court nor Congress is likely to change course anytime soon. In the meantime, something needs to be done., Public financing of campaigns, something I didnt always embrace, has clearly made a difference in Los Angeles city elections. It has given candidates who couldnt self-fund, or couldnt count on special interests to fund an \"independent expenditure\" campaign on their behalf, a chance to be heard. To broaden that opportunity, local jurisdictions should institute or expand public financing laws as much as their treasuries will allow., However, there arent enough funds in any city budget to completely level the playing field against special-interest campaigns. In Los Angeles alone, it would take tens of millions of dollars per election to adequately fund community candidates., So as long as Citizens United and its analogs are in force, fundraising limits on candidate-controlled committees should be lifted to give independent-minded or community-based candidates a credible chance to win., It is patently unfair for a candidate to be strictly limited in the amount he or she can raise from a supporter, while his opponent can benefit from massive, unlimited expenditures on his or her behalf. A community-based candidate does not have to match the spending of his better-funded opponent dollar for dollar, but he needs to have a sufficient war chest to be heard in the electoral competition., From a historical perspective, there is a method to our states madness. Like people, governments are the product of their environment., Many of Californias regulatory barriers stem from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly the Hiram Johnson reforms of 1912. They were a reaction to the concentration of power that gave corporate interests undue influence over legislation and government policy. Compartmentalizing or decentralizing decision-making was viewed as the surest way to protect the state from a complete takeover by special interests., The world, however, has changed since 1912. The structures that once made government more independent now make it less so, and less able to confront challenges in a timely manner. Fundamental reforms are necessary to bring local government into the 21st century., Zev Yaroslavsky served on the Los Angeles City Council from 1975 to 1994 and was a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors from 1994 to 2014.

{"Content": "[[, In 2011, a draft-Chris Christie movement rippled across the country, fueled by Republicans dissatisfied with their presidential field and captivated by the brash personality of New Jerseys combative governor., After a splashy trip to early-voting Iowa, however, Christie begged off. Now is not my time, he said., The question this year is whether his time has come and gone., On Tuesday, Christie formally launched an uphill bid for president with a forceful attack on the two major political parties, blaming them for Washingtons chronic polarization and promising to deliver unvarnished straight talk., New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie announces his candidacy for president Tuesday at Livingston High School in Livingston, N.J.

Chris Christie announces his candidacy for president at Livingston High SChool in New Jersey., Gov. Chris Christie announces his candidacy for president at Livingston High SChool in New Jersey., Were going to tell it like it is today, so we can create greater opportunity for every American tomorrow, Christie told a raucous crowd stuffed into the gymnasium at Livingston High School, where he served as class president. The truth will set us free, everybody., He spoke without notes, roaming the stage with a handheld microphone in a scene reminiscent of the town hall meetings that have yielded some of the most colorful and confrontational moments of his political career. There were no hecklers, but Christie suggested he was prepared to make some voters uncomfortable with his blunt-spoken style., Youre gonna get what I think, whether you like it or not, he said, and whether it makes you cringe every once in awhile or not., For all the characteristic brashness, however, Christie enters the Republican field as a distinct longshot among the 14 major declared candidates., A relative moderate in a party that has grown increasingly conservative, unpopular at home and trailing far behind other Republicans in both fundraising and opinion polls, Christie has seen his political star badly fade since the heady days four years ago., Perhaps most damaging, the assertive style that once so animated audiences is no longer an unalloyed asset. A scandal involving political payback and a now-famous traffic tie-up on the George Washington Bridge reinforced the image of Christie as something of a bully, even as the governor steadfastly has denied involvement in any wrongdoing., Rather than shrink from his aggressive nature, campaign strategists hope to turn Christies persona back to his advantage, portraying him as a truth-teller and someone willing to take on politically difficult issues, including overhauling Social Security, that more timid rivals wont touch., The governor emphasized that theme repeatedly as he spoke for nearly half an hour without notes or prepared text. His off-the-cuff approach led to some disjointed passages  The horse is out of the barn, he said regarding federal spending  we got to get it back, and we can only do it by force. But his command of his message and policy proposals offered a strong contrast with his more scripted opponents., Joining him onstage throughout were his wife and the couples four children, as fans waved blue signs with Christies campaign slogan: Telling it like it is., Christie first gained wide notice as New Jerseys top federal prosecutor. Appointed in 2001, he made his name fighting the states deep-seated political corruption, going after lawmakers without regard to party. He resigned soon after President Obamas 2008 election and a year later beat incumbent Democrat Jon Corzine to become New Jerseys governor., In his first term, Christie worked with Democrats to pass a tighter property tax cap and a pension-reform plan that he touts as a model of bipartisan consensus  something, he said Tuesday, that is lacking in Washington., Both parties have failed our country by refusing to work together, he said. If Washington and Adams and Jefferson had believed compromise was a dirty word, wed still be under the crown of England., When Hurricane Sandy walloped the Jersey Shore in 2012, Christie set aside political differences and linked arms with Obama to address the disaster; some partisans have never forgiven him. (He had little good to say about the president on Tuesday, however, describing him as weak and indecisive, among other criticisms.), In 2013, Christie won overwhelming reelection, with strong support from Latinos and other Democratic-leaning constituencies. But soon after, news broke that aides had engineered a series of massive traffic jams in Fort Lee, N.J., across the Hudson River from New York City, to punish the citys Democratic mayor for refusing to endorse Christie. The governors political stock plunged, at home and across the country, and has yet to recover., One of Christies appointees to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey  a former high school classmate  has pleaded guilty to criminal charges for his role in tying up the bridge. Two other Christie allies also have been charged. A federal investigation continues, suggesting the case will remain in the news for some time., Christie has tried to move on. Asked about the scandal, he told a New Hampshire audience last month that prosecutors already would have acted if they could have gotten something on me, I suspect., After his announcement, Christie headed to New Hampshire for several days of campaigning. He is counting heavily on the state, which holds the first presidential primary and traditionally has looked kindly on less-conservative Republicans. His campaign hopes Christies take-all-comers approach to campaigning will boost him the way it helped Arizona Sen.

{"Content": "[[, In a Gavin Newsom governorship, Californias current bullet train project probably would be derailed., The delta twin tunnels, as presently envisioned, also likely would be buried., Those are Gov. Jerry Browns two big legacy-builders. But Brown will be termed out after 2018, and Lt. Gov. Newsoms goal is to succeed him., The two Democrats see eye-to-eye on many things, but not on the train or the tunnels., Thats useful information because Newsom, 47, the former San Francisco mayor, officially announced last week that hell run for governor in 2018., Newsom didnt trumpet his objections to Browns pet projects in the formal announcement. Quite the opposite., He proclaimed that \"Californians are blessed with the remarkable leadership of Gov. Jerry Brown, who  has led our state to firm fiscal footing and brought us to the enviable position of dreaming  and achieving  big dreams again.\", But I later asked him about two Brown dreams. Newsom, unlike so many politicians, invariably is candid., He thinks the bullet trains financing is too risky and would drain money from other, more necessary infrastructure projects such as roads, transit and waterworks., You recall the history: Voters in 2008 authorized $9 billion in bonds to begin building a 500-mile high-speed rail line from Los Angeles to San Francisco, with later extensions to San Diego and Sacramento. That L.A.-San Francisco first phase was to cost $33 billion. The federal government and private investors, voters were told, would kick in the rest of the money., But the state received only $3.3 billion from the feds and have repeatedly been told by Congress that therell be no more. Private financiers havent put up a dime. The projected cost has more than doubled to $68 billion. And theres no longer any talk about extensions to San Diego or Sacramento, Brown did pick up more funding last year from the Legislature. It appropriated $650 million in cap-and-trade greenhouse emission fees. And it allocated 25% of future cap-and-trade revenue to the project, meaning between $500 million and $1 billion annually., Says Newsom: \"Youd be hard pressed to find a bigger champion of high-speed rail than me when the bond went to voters. I believed in it. But my current problem with it is the financing. I cant in good conscience square what I was supporting then with what were doing today.\", He says Brown is confident the project eventually will attract private investment. \"If so, that changes the game.\", \"But absent something significant  and I mean, really significant  I cant see supporting something that would come at such a high cost to other infrastructure. I dont see how we could go forward. Theres got to be a different financing plan. Without it, the math doesnt add up.\", Concerning the $25-billion twin tunnels  40-foot-wide, 30-mile-long monstrosities under the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta that would divert fresh water from the estuary  Newsom leans toward the opposition., \"Im not supportive\" of the proposal, Newsom says, calling it \"too aggressive.\" Hed prefer an alternative thats \"substantially more modest and substantially less impactful\" to the environment., \"Jerry Brown is uniquely positioned to figure this out,\" Newsom adds. \"And his legacy is going to be advanced or diminished by his ability to figure it out.\", Newsom never has been one to shy away from controversy., As San Francisco mayor, he was far ahead of his time by issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples., In the practically powerless job of lieutenant governor, Newsom early on became impatient with the lack of progress in Sacramento on job creation. So he wrote his own sensible economic growth plan, angering Brown, who felt upstaged., An opponent of the death penalty, Newsom in 2012 publicly supported Proposition 34, which would have abolished capital punishment and substituted life in prison without parole. Brown and Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris  both longtime death penalty opponents  didnt utter a peep. The measure narrowly lost., \"It frustrates me no end,\" Newsom says of the many politicians who kept mum on Prop. 34. \"I get the politics, but \", Now Newsom is trying to craft a coalition and a 2016 ballot initiative to legalize marijuana., \"I cant support the status quo,\" he says. \"The war on drugs is more impactful than the drug itself.\", Besides the wasted money on law enforcement and incarceration, he continues, \"we have an underground economy controlled by bad people. I dont want the drug dealer being the arbiter of who marijuana is appropriate for.\", He wants to keep pot away from kids. \"Theres no question that for young kids it has a significant impact on brain development,\" he says. \"And it scares me as a parent. I dont like the smell. I dont want it in a park or playground.\", But, of course, he has smoked weed, right?, \"Its a weird thing,\" he replies. \"I dont like to admit it. Nobodys going to believe me. I almost want to lie and say I did. But it was never my thing., \"I was more interested in wine and beer, which Id argue have a more negative impact. Im a restaurant and bar owner and own three wineries. I cant moralize about marijuana when Im sitting there selling alcohol.\", Newsoms candidacy announcement was probably the earliest of anyone in history. No playing coy. Good for him.

{"Content": "[[, In a historic break with its past, the California Republican Party voted overwhelmingly Sunday to formally recognize a gay GOP group., The move, which drew the condemnation of some socially conservative GOP members, grants a charter to the Log Cabin Republicans California chapter, making it an official volunteer arm of the state party. It is among the first gay groups in the nation to be officially sanctioned by a state Republican party., Brandon Gesicki, a delegate from Carmel who supported the effort, said the 861-293 vote at the state GOP convention here showed how much that organization had changed in recent years., \"It would have been the complete opposite 15 years ago,\" said Gesicki, who also turned in a proxy vote from former Lt. Gov. Abel Maldonado supporting the recognition. \"The fringe does not control the party anymore. We truly are a big tent once again.\", The decision comes at a critical moment for gay-rights supporters., The U.S. Supreme Court is set to decide on the constitutionality of bans on same-sex marriage in June. The issue is likely to be prominent in the 2016 presidential campaign. And in California, where GOP voter registration is at a historic low of 28%, the party is desperately courting groups of voters, such as gays and ethnic minorities, who tend to favor Democrats., Charles Moran, chairman of Log Cabin California chapter, was visibly emotional Sunday., \"Im personally overwhelmed,\" he said, noting that he got his start in politics as a staffer in the state party in 1999. \"This is the culmination of a 15-year journey for me.\", Democrats were skeptical., \"Recognizing and acknowledging that everyone deserves a shot at representation, no matter their sexual orientation, is an important first step,\" said state Democratic Party spokesman Tenoch Flores. But \"Republicans are light-years behind\" in enacting policy that reflects such recognition \"and are likely to remain there,\" he said. Democrats have chartered an LGBT caucus since at least the mid-90s, Flores said., Republicans relationship with gays, once adversarial, has grown warmer in recent years, particularly in California., Last year, gubernatorial candidate Neel Kashkari marched in a gay-pride parade, the first Republican statewide candidate to do so. Assemblyman Rocky Chavez, who is considering a run for U.S. Senate, supports same-sex marriage. The Log Cabin Luau, featuring rainbow-colored leis and mai tais, is among the best attended parties at state GOP conventions., On Sunday, convention delegate Christopher Bowman, who became active in the gay Republican group in 1980, said he was gratified by the recognition decades after the group first sought it., \"I feel like Im channeling Thaddeus Stevens,\" he said, referring the Civil War-era abolitionist. \"Weve earned it. Weve been in the trenches for 30 years.\", Richard Grenell, a Los Angeles-based conservative strategist and commentator who is gay, said the formal approval was long overdue., \"Its embarrassing to be talking about this in 2015 as progress. But it is progress,\" he said., Grenell said theres a strategic benefit to the partys embrace of the group, whose name honors President Lincolns humble origins and dedication to equality. The GOP has not elected a candidate to statewide office since 2006., \"The California Republican Party understands that if theyre going to win elections  which theyve been very bad at lately  theyve got to add to their numbers, not subtract,\" Grenell said. \"It seems like a pretty basic concept.\", But areas of deep conflict remain, both in California and across the nation., The national Log Cabin group was once again turned down as a sponsor for last weeks Conservative Political Action Committee gathering in Maryland, although its executive director was invited to speak on a panel. In Texas last year, two gay Republicans groups were barred from having a booth at a state party convention., The California GOPs official platform says homosexuality is unacceptable., \"We believe public policy and education should not be exploited to present or teach homosexuality as an acceptable alternative lifestyle. We oppose same-sex partner benefits, child custody, and adoption,\" the platform says., Opponents of the recognition vote Sunday cited the platform, moral values and a bylaw that forbids the recognition of organizations focused on \"lifestyle preferences.\", John Briscoe, president of the socially conservative California Republican Assembly, pointed to Log Cabins support of same-sex marriage., \"I have a hard time understanding how were going to charter an organization thats in opposition to our platform,\" he said during the floor debate., Andrew Levy, a delegate from Sacramento, said the decision was an affront to his Jewish faith., \"People supported the Republican Party because theyre strong on family values,\" Levy said, adding that the embrace of the gay group undermined his trust in the GOP., Log Cabins effort received the imprimatur of influential GOP leaders, including national committee member Shawn Steel and former state party chairman Bob Naylor. They cited the groups volunteer work for the party in electoral battles across the decades to argue that it deserved a charter., \"The Log Cabin Republicans have given their time, money and resources to this party time and time again, and we have given them nothing in return,\" said Nathan Miller, chairman of the California Young Republican Federation, a group for young professionals that is chartered by the state party. \"This vote is not about orientation, its about participation.\", The Sunday morning proceedings took nearly an hour. Five people were allowed to speak in support of a charter and five in opposition., Though the debate was largely civil, there were a few testy outbursts, mostly on points of order, prompting state party Chairman Jim Brulte to admonish at one point: \"Everyone take a deep breath.\", seema.mehta@latimes.com, Twitter:@LATSeema, melanie.mason@latimes.com, Twitter: @melmason]", "Date": "20150301", "Title": "[ State GOP formally welcomes gays to the party]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-california-republicans-20150302-story.html", "Author": "[Seema Mehta, Melanie Mason]"}
{"Content": "[[, In a large and varied Republican field, there may not be a more confounding presidential candidate than Tuesdays entry, John Kasich., In the 1990s, he was part of the conservative revolution on Capitol Hill. As governor of Ohio for the last four-and-a-half years, he has cut income taxes and government regulation, battled organized labor and approved new restrictions on abortion and voting rights., Trail Guide: 2016 presidential campaign >>, He also spared several inmates from execution, supported higher taxes on cigarettes and fracking of natural gas deposits and horrified many conservatives by expanding healthcare access under the Affordable Care Act, throwing in a lecture on what it means to be a good Christian., When you die and get to the meeting with St. Peter, hes probably not going to ask you much about what you did about keeping government small, Kasich said. But hes going to ask what you did for the poor. You better have a good answer., His political unpredictability, late start in the race and relatively meager fundraising make Kasich a distinct underdog in the GOP contest. He may not even qualify for the first GOP candidates debate next month in Cleveland., But Kasich insisted Tuesday that he has defied long odds throughout his career and offers a set of skills that no other candidate can match., I know what needs to be done, he said at a kickoff rally in Columbus, at his alma mater, Ohio State. Ive been there at all levels, OK?, Delivered in his characteristic plain-spoken style, Kasichs long, meandering speech spoke of the economic anxiety many Americans feel and the disillusionment of African Americans convinced the system is stacked against them. Frequently invoking his faith, he said society too often substitutes harsh judgment for care and compassion., He offered few policy specifics beyond a summons to ignore party labels and work toward solutions. Policy is more important than politics, ideology or any of the other nonsense we see, Kasich said., The appearance in front of 4,000 cheering supporters distilled the candidate to his essence: It was unscripted, ambitious, scattered and often assertively blunt. Indeed, one of the largest questions surrounding Kasichs candidacy is a personal one:, Is he too abrasive to be elected president?, Stories abound of his gruff persona, of a prickly meeting with local reporters in New Hampshire, which holds the first primary; of lashing out at a wealthy GOP donor who questioned his embrace of Obamacare; of threatening lobbyists in Columbus, the state capital, if they obstructed his efforts. If youre not on the bus, well run over you with the bus, he told them two days after he was elected governor. And Im not kidding., Kasich doesnt apologize for his rough manner, citing his blue-collar upbringing in an industrial town outside Pittsburgh. Were pretty direct where we come from, he said at a recent news conference, adding, At the end of the day, its results. Did people feel lifted? Did they feel included?, Kasichs willingness to break with conservatives, by, among other things, defending the federal education standards known as Common Core and backing a path to citizenship for people in the country illegally, ensure he will, at the least, stand out., Whether that is a good thing remains to be seen., His backers say Kasich exhibits an unflinching, unbeholden style that voters, tired of the political same-old, will appreciate. Theres a freshness and authenticity, said Curt Steiner, a longtime GOP strategist in Columbus. Hes not a cookie-cutter candidate., Some Republican activists, which is to say those most likely to vote in the partys nominating contest, take a less-kind view., Kasich has at times gone out of his way to poke his fellow Republicans in the eye, said the conservative National Review, in a story assessing Kasichs presidential hopes. Many may be scratching their heads and asking: Is he serious? And, if so, why bother?, At age 63, Kasich is making his second try for the White House. He waged a short-lived campaign in 1999 but, by his own admission, was too young and inexperienced to take on, much less defeat, the overwhelming front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush., In Congress, where he represented central Ohio for 18 years, Kasich built a reputation for fiscal conservatism; as chairman of the House Budget Committee, he worked with President Clinton to balance the federal budget for the first time in a generation. Even then, Kasich broke with many in his party, voting for an assault-weapons ban, opposing corporate welfare and fighting defense spending he deemed wasteful., After leaving Congress in 2001, Kasich hosted a program on Fox television and worked as a managing director at Lehman Bros. until the Wall Street firm collapsed in 2008. He returned to office in 2010 when he was elected Ohio governor in a close race. Four years later, Kasich romped to reelection against a weak opponent, winning 86 of Ohios 88 counties, including the Democratic strongholds surrounding Cleveland, Akron and Toledo., Part of his appeal as a presidential candidate, at least on paper, is his political strength in a state that Republicans almost certainly need to win the White House.

{"Content": "[[, In a milestone accord, President Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro agreed Wednesday to swiftly reestablish diplomatic relations and reopen embassies in each others capitals, finally ending the half-century diplomatic freeze between the two Cold War adversaries., Standing in a sunny Rose Garden, Obama said many Americans and Cubans were making a choice between the future and the past and urged critics in Congress to do the same by lifting the decades-old U.S. trade embargo., Americans and Cubans alike are ready to move forward, he said. I believe its time for Congress to do the same., Restoring relations with Cuba after a 54-year rupture fulfills a major foreign policy goal for Obama, who called for improving ties when he first ran for the White House in 2008. It also removes one of the last vestiges of the Cold War more than a quarter of a century after it ended, although the U.S. economic embargo on Cuba remains in effect., Obama and Castro traded letters confirming plans to reopen permanent diplomatic missions on July 20. Both leaders wrote that they were encouraged by the reciprocal intention to develop respectful and cooperative relations between our two peoples and governments., Secretary of State John F. Kerry said that he would join the opening ceremony in Havana and that he looked forward to raising the Stars and Stripes over the embassy, noting that no U.S. envoy of his rank has visited there since 1945., This step has been long overdue, Kerry said in Vienna, where he is participating in nuclear talks with Iran. Aides said Obama also hopes to visit Cuba before he leaves office in 2017., Cuban TV took the unusual step of broadcasting Obamas Rose Garden remarks live. Local newspapers, which often wait for official government pronouncements, blasted front-page headlines about the embassy openings early Wednesday., Cubas acting foreign minister, Marcelino Medina, met with Jeffrey DeLaurentis, head of the U.S. Interests Section, to formally exchange documents. Both countries have operated lower-level diplomatic missions since the 1970s, but without full diplomatic ties., The State Department is expected to upgrade the Interests Section, part of a multistory seaside building that previously served as the U.S. Embassy, rather than move into a new building., This is not merely symbolic, Obama said. With this change, we will be able to substantially increase our contacts with the Cuban people. Well have more personnel at our embassy. And our diplomats will have the ability to engage more broadly across the island. That will include the Cuban government, civil society and ordinary Cubans who are reaching for a better life., After months of secret talks by their aides, Obama and Castro stunned much of the world in December when they simultaneously announced that they would move to normalize relations, including easing travel and trade restrictions., The two sides held four rounds of closed-door talks and last month the State Department removed Cuba from its list of state sponsors of terrorism, a key Cuban demand to restore diplomatic ties., The administration has rebuffed Cubas demand to close the U.S. naval station at Guantanamo Bay, which the U.S. military has occupied since 1903 and the Spanish-American War., Analysts described the resumption of ties as the most substantive step since the diplomatic thaw began, but said sharp differences remain., This will be a normal relationship between governments, where we dont necessarily see eye to eye, but where there is cooperation, thats where its going, said Philip Peters, an analyst with the nonpartisan Cuba Research Center in Alexandria, Va., We now begin the long and challenging process of normalization of relations far beyond just reopening embassies  building commercial, social, cultural and political ties, said Fulton Armstrong, a professor at American Universitys Center for Latin American and Latino Studies., If we do U.S.-Cuba relations right, it will set a new tone for U.S. ties throughout Latin America, to the benefit of the entire hemisphere, Armstrong said. Congress will have to do its part [and] unshackle the administration from legacy legislation., For now, Congress appears unlikely to lift the economic embargo, which was first imposed in the 1960s and stiffened several times, and allow U.S. businesses to invest freely in Cuba. Critics in both parties lined up Wednesday to emphasize their opposition., Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Congress may not approve money for the new embassy or confirm an ambassador after Obama nominates one., Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also slammed the White House move. Once again the regime is being rewarded while they jail dissidents, silence political opponents, and harbor American fugitives and cop killers, he said in a statement., The foreign policy shift immediately became part of the 2016 presidential race, although its unclear whether the issue has resonance beyond parts of Florida where Cuban exiles are based., As Americans prepare to celebrate the anniversary of our freedom from tyranny and commit anew to the democratic principles on which our nation was founded, it is no small irony that President Obama prepares to open an embassy in Havana, further legitimizing the brutal Castro regime, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is seeking the Republican nomination, said in a statement., Obama acknowledged those concerns in his Rose Garden remarks, noting very real, profound differences between our governments., He said U.S. officials will not hesitate to speak out about the rights of Cubans to speak and assemble freely. But the best way to support U.S. values is through engagement, he argued., You cant hold the future of Cuba hostage to what happened in the past, he said., Parsons reported from Washington and Wilkinson from Mexico City., For news about President Obama and the Obama administration, follow me on Twitter: @cparsons, ALSO:, Unlocking Cuba: Visiting our long-forbidden neighbor, Cuba photos: Then and now, Young Cuban artists testing the boundaries of dissent, 4:07 p.m.: This article was updated with more information., 9:49 a.m.: This story was updated with details from Cuban President Raul Castros letter., 8:53 a.m.: This story was updated with details from President Obamas remarks., This story was originally published at 8:15 a.m.]", "Date": "20150701", "Title": "[With embassies to reopen, Obama urges Congress to 'move forward' on Cuba]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-obama-embassy-cuba-20150701-story.html", "Author": "[Christi Parsons, Tracy Wilkinson]"}
{"Content": "[[, In a move that further lays the groundwork for a potential2016 presidential campaign, Jeb Bush on Tuesday announced the formation of a political action committee that will allow him to begin raking in money from donors., The announcement of Bushs PAC -- named \"Right to Rise\" -- comes after the former Republican Florida governor announced last month that he would \"actively explore\" a presidential run. A super PAC, separate from Bush, was also established Tuesday by supporters and carries the same name., Bush, donning a black pea coatas he walked down a Manhattan street, said the PAC supports candidates \"who believe in conservative principles to allow all Americans to rise up,\" in a video posted in both English and Spanish to his Facebook page., The New York Times noted that the announcement video from Bush was taped outside the midtown Manhattan offices of BlackRock, an investment management firm that often bankrolls political campaigns., The move from Bush to create the PAC is similar to those already created by other potential 2016 presidential candidates, including Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida., On the committees website, Bush writes \"we will celebrate success and risk-taking, protect liberty, cherish free enterprise, strengthen our national defense, embrace the energy revolution, fix our broken and obsolete immigration system.\", In whats likely to be a crowded 2016 GOP primary, Bush, a favorite among mainstream Republicans, has drawn anger from some in the party for his calls for comprehensive immigration reform and his support of Common Core, the national education standards for K-12 students that is being implemented in dozens of states., Since late last year, Bush has made a host of moves to make a potential candidacy more visible, such as announcing that he planned to write an e-book on his governorship and the release of 250,000 emails from his tenure as Floridas chief executive.

{"Content": "[[, In a relatively small state, Harry Reid loomed terrifically large, so his decision to exit the U.S. Senate after 2016 opens a massive void that left members of both parties scrambling., The description of Nevadas senior lawmaker was heard so often that it became a cliche, but one thoroughly grounded in truth: The wily Democrat was never beloved by Nevada voters, who sent him to Washington repeatedly over the decades, but he was greatly respected  even feared, at least by some he faced in political battle., If he couldnt convince you with a handshake, hed try it with a left jab, Michael Green, a state historian and professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said of the onetime amateur boxer. He was a street fighter for what he believed in and wanted., Reid, first elected to the Senate in 1986, almost single-handedly stopped federal plans to truck the nations nuclear waste to a dump at Yucca Mountain, in the desert 100 miles outside Las Vegas. He was indispensable in helping turn Nevada from a Republican stronghold into a competitive state that Democrat Barack Obama carried twice., He was also vital in creating the Nevada presidential caucuses, which started in 2008 as a way to include a Western voice in the early nominating process., As such, his exit marks an epic upheaval in state politics, and both parties on Friday were trying to divine the sudden opportunities and potential pitfalls., A 2016 race that was considered close but leaning in Reids direction, given his history of surviving near-death political experiences, has suddenly become a toss-up and will probably be among the most closely watched and hardest-fought in the country., Gov. Brian Sandoval is the overwhelming favorite of the Republican establishment to succeed Reid, even though he has regularly expressed no desire to move to Washington or serve in the Senate., Pointedly, Sandoval has also never issued a statement definitively ruling out a 2016 candidacy, although his actions  including a call for the largest tax increase in Nevada history  signaled the unlikelihood of a run., Do you really think  I would propose the things that I proposed last night, thinking I might be on a ballot? Sandoval asked Jon Ralston, a Reno Gazette-Journal columnist, after unveiling the tax proposal and an ambitious education overhaul plan in Januarys State of the State address., But Reids decision has given Sandoval reason to reconsider and led many to believe he will now give the race very serious thought. He offered no public statement on his plans Friday., Of course it has to change the dynamic, said one leading state Republican, who did not want to be identified speculating about the governors political future. I would imagine the next 48 to 96 hours will be filled with intensive contemplation., If Sandoval entered the Senate race, he would be a commanding front-runner. A former federal judge who stepped down to run for governor in 2010  when he beat Reids son, Rory  he is enormously popular, having won reelection in November with nearly 70% support., Should he opt out, two Republican Nevada congressmen who also passed on facing Reid, Reps. Joe Heck and Mark Amodei, might give the race another look, along with former Lt. Gov. Brian Krolicki. Other potential GOP contestants include Mark Hutchison, the states newly elected lieutenant governor, and Michael Roberson, the majority leader of the state Senate., At the very least, Sandoval is expected to play a large behind-the-scenes role working to rally Republicans behind a single candidate in hopes of avoiding a repeat of 2010., In that election, former state Assemblywoman Sharron Angle emerged as the winner of a free-for-all primary, but her extreme views and penchant for incendiary comments turned a once-close contest into a relative romp for Reid, who won by 5 percentage points., On the Democratic side, the field is much thinner, in part because Republicans swept every statewide office in November, devastating the partys bench. Possible Democratic candidates include Ross Miller, the former secretary of state; Catherine Cortez Masto, a former state attorney general now serving as executive vice chancellor of the Nevada System of Higher Education; and U.S. Rep. Dina Titus., ------------, FOR THE RECORD, March 28, 7:55 p.m.: An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to Dina Titus as a former congresswoman. She is still in office., ------------, On Friday, Reid signaled his support for Masto, praising her resume and calling her a good person., For his part, Sandoval lavishly praised Reid and thanked him for his long service in public office, starting nearly 50 years ago when Reid was elected to the state Legislature. Despite their different parties, the two shared a strong working relationship and, even before Friday, had publicly spoken well of each other., He is one of Nevadas native sons, a pioneer of the West who has always worked tirelessly to fight for Nevadans with a gritty determination, Sandoval said in a written statement., His legacy will last for generations., As Sandoval suggested, Reids longevity  cited by critics who called him a leading cause of Washington dysfunction  was an important asset for his home state and something Nevadans may come to miss once he and his clout are gone., Lets face it, were a small Western state with a very powerful senator, said Eric Herzik, a longtime Reid watcher who teaches political science at the University of Nevada, Reno. When he goes away, we become invisible., If Sen. Dianne Feinstein were to step down, California would still be the biggest state in the country, Herzik went on.

{"Content": "[[, In a rulingthat could have reverberations around the country, a federal judge on Thursday struck down an Ohio law thatbars individuals from knowingly making false statements about political candidates., Thedecision from District Court Judge Timothy Black follows the U.S. Supreme Courts unanimous ruling in June that a political groupcould proceed with a 1st Amendment challenge against the Ohio law that criminalizes \"false\" political speech., Calling the law unconstitutional, Black wrote in his 25-page ruling that \"the answer to false statements in politics is not to force silence, but to encourage truthful speech in response, and to let the voters, not the government, decide what the political truth is.\", He also ordered the states Elections Commission to cease enforcing the law and noted that its up to lawmakers -- and not a court -- to rewrite the statute. \"There is no reason,\" Black said, to believe that the commission is positioned to determine what is true and what is false when it comes to literature and advertisements against candidates., At its core, the case stems from a 2010 criminal complaint filed by former U.S.Rep. Steve Driehaus (D-Ohio) against theSusan B. Anthony List, an antiabortion group. That year, as Driehaus faced a tight reelection race,the group planned to post billboard ads that said the Democrats support of President Obamas healthcare law was in essence support for abortion., Driehaus, who opposes abortion, cited the Ohio law in his complaint against the Susan B. Anthony List, prompting the owner of the billboards where the ads were set to go on display to not put them up., Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, applauded Blacks decision., After four years and a trip to the U.S. Supreme Court, today we finally have a victory for free speech,Dannenfelser said in a statement., She also said that over the summermore than 20 groups from \"across the political spectrum\" submitted amicus briefs to the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of the Susan B.

{"Content": "[[, In a season of rough campaign attack ads, the one aimed at a North Carolina judge was among the roughest., \"Justice Robin Hudson sided with the predators,\" viewers were told. \"Justice Robin Hudson  not tough on child molesters, not fair to victims.\", Hudson, a Democrat on the North Carolina Supreme Court, was one of the state-level judges targeted this year by the Republican State Leadership Committee, which spent $4 million nationwide on an effort to tilt state courts in a conservative direction., Though Republicans took control of the Senate and many governors mansions in the midterm election, the committees courthouse campaigns fell short of unseating Hudson and judges it targeted in Montana, Tennessee and Missouri., Judicial campaigns once were typically sedate affairs, little noticed outside of bar association dinners, but that is changing rapidly under a new wave of campaign spending driven by outside political groups and unlimited donations. Court campaigns in several states set spending records, according to a study that counted about $14 million in television advertising in state Supreme Court races  about $2 million more than in 2010., \"Special-interest groups are seeing that with a small amount of money, relative to what they spend on a governors race, they can have a big impact,\" said Barbara Pariente, a Supreme Court justice in Florida who in 2012 fended off the state Republican Party and Americans for Prosperity, an outside organization funded largely by the billionaire conservative Koch brothers., \"Even if they dont succeed in removing a justice, they believe they have succeeded in sending a message: When you make a ruling against public opinion, you do it at your peril,\" she said., Taking the lead are conservative organizations often looking for judges who will make business-friendly decisions or support their social causes. The big money on the Democratic side has traditionally come from trial lawyers, who see a vested interest in protecting judges sympathetic to victims suing for negligence., The rising tide of money in judicial elections can undermine judges independence by forcing them to seek campaign dollars. Reform groups argue that judges, unlike legislators, need insulation from the swings of public opinion., \"We expect judges to do things differently,\" said Bert Brandenburg, executive director of Justice at Stake, a group that opposes special-interest pressure on courts. \"The more we ask judges to take off the black robes and put on politicians three-piece suits, the greater the risk those politicians will intrude in courtrooms.\", American methods of picking judges reflect an unease with allowing them to be tainted by politics. In 24 states, governors choose candidates screened by bipartisan committees. But voters usually decide whether judges can keep their jobs, and some of the nastiest attacks have come in those elections., State courts hear 100 million cases a year, many on important issues: death row appeals, voter ID laws, the drawing of legislative districts, how much money accident victims can recover., For outside groups, trying to turn a judicial race is still a bargain. A $750,000 ad buy, a fraction of whats spent in a campaign for governor or Senate, can sometimes affect the outcome of a race in which voters are barely acquainted with whos running., Some state courts have seen pitched ideological battles. Courts in Texas and Alabama were considered sympathetic venues for plaintiffs and big judgments before political consultant Karl Rove helped engineer years-long fights to elect conservative judges in both states in the 1990s., Watchdog groups say such outside spending on judicial campaigns has become more widespread and aggressive since the Supreme Courts 2010 Citizens United decision, which removed limits on how much corporations could contribute to political causes. The influx of money, some of it from undisclosed sources, has trickled down into statehouse and judicial campaigns., \"The sad part of this is, this has become the new normal,\" Brandenburg said. \"This is really far beyond what anybody has ever seen.\", The head of the Republican State Leadership Committee said the groups campaign took shape last year in response to complaints from statehouse Republicans., \"They were passing legislation and they were finding courts were out of step with the views from voters about where they wanted the state to go,\" said Matt Walter, the committees president. \"These good policies were running into the buzz saw of a liberal judiciary.\", In North Carolina, Republicans who took over the states General Assembly in 2010 passed a law ending public financing of court elections. Thats where the leadership committee made its biggest play this year, sending $1.3 million to a conservative group called Justice for All NC. In 2012, the North Carolina group spent heavily against the state Supreme Court bid of Sam Ervin IV, grandson of the senator who led the Watergate investigation. Ervin won a seat on the court this month., Justice Hudson, a Democrat first elected to the North Carolina court in 2006, said her consultants warned her to expect the same treatment. But she wasnt anticipating an ad saying she supported child molesters; she said it began airing about 10 days before the May primary and seemed to be \"run nonstop on every TV outlet in the state.\", \"I was, of course, horrified,\" she said., The ad refers to a dissent Hudson wrote in which she said it was unfair that a law requiring sex offenders to wear electronic-monitoring devices should apply to a man who was convicted before the law was passed., She said the ad distorted her position and prompted a strong backlash from voters and the media. \"It backfired big-time,\" she said., Walter said his committee \"didnt have a say\" in the content of the ad, and he declined to offer an opinion on it. A Justice for All director did not return requests for comment., There is some evidence that the ads can sway rulings. In states with more spending, judges were found to be 7% to 8% less likely to vote in favor of defendants appeals, according to a recent study., The biggest donors to the Republican State Leadership Committee were corporations and businessmen. Tobacco company RJ Reynolds, the Chamber of Commerce, Blue Cross/Blue Shield and the Koch brothers were among the largest donors, according to data gathered by the Center for Responsive Politics. But the committees ads often said little about economic issues, instead hammering judges as soft on criminals; such gut appeals are often more effective, say experts on judicial elections., \"People dont care about business interests for the most part,\" said Joanna Shepherd, an Emory University law professor who co-wrote the study., One of the most expensive and contentious races this year was in Illinois, where Justice Lloyd Karmeier ran for a second 10-year term. His first campaign, in 2004, cost a record $6.8 million; he was one of the judges who set aside a $10.1-billion verdict against tobacco giant Philip Morris., This year, lawyers appealing that decision demanded Karmeier recuse himself from the case, citing millions in campaign donations from the chamber and other groups supporting Philip Morris. But Karmeier declined, saying that he got no money directly from the tobacco giant and that there was no evidence he couldnt be impartial., \"The choice we were confronted with was: Do you do something about this, or do you roll over?\" said George Zelcs, one of the lawyers., He wrote two $300,000 checks to a group called the Campaign for 2016, which ran commercials attacking Karmeier. \"Predators abusing children,\" one of those ads said. \"Rapists, murderers let off easily.\", The Republican leadership committee  which received $230,000 from Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris  spent $960,000 to support the judge. Karmeier won, but barely., Walter says its misguided to try to take money and politics out of the process. \"When you have an election, youre already in the political realm,\" he said, adding that the spending is a \"good and healthy thing\" that helps educate voters., Walter said leadership committee efforts were useful even when they failed. In Tennessee, the committee spent $340,000 to oppose the retention of three state Supreme Court justices. All three kept their seats, but the court, which chooses the states attorney general, later picked a Republican for the office for the first time., \"We helped [the judges] get in better touch with their voters,\" Walter said. \"I would not say we scared them into anything.\", joseph.tanfani@latimes.com]", "Date": "20141123", "Title": "[Judicial elections getting more political with new campaign spending]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-judicial-elections-20141123-story.html", "Author": "[Joseph Tanfani]"}
{"Content": "[[, In an extraordinary exchange on live radio this week, Donald Trump seemed to stumble when he landed in the Middle East., It started when he was asked about Maj. Gen. Qassem Suleimani, the powerful and popular military officer who heads the elite Quds force of Irans Revolutionary Guard Corps., \"The Kurds ... have been horribly mistreated,\" Trump suggested, prompting an exchange with radio host Hugh Hewitt that at times sounded a bit like a Laurel and Hardy routine., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, No, not the Kurds  the Quds forces, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Quds forces, Hewitt said. \"The bad guys., Oh, I thought you said Kurds, Kurds, Trump said., \"No, Quds.\", Kurds, Quds: What should Trump know about Qassem Suleimani?, The once-reclusive commander of Tehrans legendary intelligence gathering and covert war operations across the Middle East and South Asia has lately emerged as a major figure in Iran, with celebrity-like status and an outsized presence on the Web., Conservative Iranian bloggers have called him the countrys most honest leader and have urged him to run for president in 2017., His silvery-bearded image has appeared in photographs from the worlds battlefields, on posters brandished at political rallies and in pop music videos. So ubiquitous has he become, in fact, that a photograph of him supposedly shaking hands with astronaut Neil Armstrong on the surface of the moon in 1969 was circulated on social media., The Quds force, which he commands, is the special forces unit of the Revolutionary Guard Corps responsible for operations outside Irans borders. It takes its name from the Persian word for Jerusalem, which it has vowed to liberate., Under Suleimanis leadership, the force is believed to have armed allies and assassinated rivals in an effort to defend Irans Shiite Muslim revolution and project its influence across the region., U.S. officials twice declared Suleimani a terrorist and accused him of directing attacks on American forces in Iraq a decade ago., But there he was earlier this year, according to photographs circulated on the Internet, apparently drinking tea outside Tikrit at the start of the Shiite led-governments campaign -- heartily endorsed by the U.S. -- to take back the city from Islamic State fighters., It was not the first time that Washington has found itself on the same side as a man long viewed as an arch-foe. After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Iran was reported to have provided intelligence to the U.S. to help its forces overthrow the Taliban in Afghanistan., In an interview with the BBC Persian service, the former U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Ryan C. Crocker, described the central role later played by Suleimani in talks about stemming sectarian violence in that country., Irans ambassador \"called repeatedly for breaks\" during the talks, Crocker said. \"I couldnt quite figure out why, and then later discovered that whenever I said something that he didnt have covered in his points, he would need to call back to Tehran for guidance - he was that tightly controlled. On the other end of the phone was Qassem Suleimani.\", In a speech this week to Irans Assembly of Experts, an influential panel of clerics that chooses the countrys supreme leader, Suleimaniwas reported to have proclaimed the collapse of American power in the region. He accused the United States of seeking to preserve the presence of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria so the regions Muslims would continue to need American help, according to reports cited by the Middle East news site Al-Monitor., In Syria, Suleimani has served as point person for the critical backing that Iran has provided to the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad in the war against rebels supported by the U.S. and its allies., Many people would say hes the most dangerous man in the world, Hewitt told Trump in Thursdays interview., That seemed to trigger a flash of recognition., \"Is he the gentleman that was going back and forth with Russia and meeting with Putin?\" he said, referring to the Russian president., Thats the guy, Hewitt said., Not good, Trump agreed., Trump didnt fare much better when it came to name recognition of many of the regions other militant leaders, but dismissed such questions as \"gotcha\" tactics., As far as the individual players, of course I dont know them.

Harris turns out to be the Los Angeles Police Protective League., Her announcement Wednesday of the unions support underscored that a paramount goal for Harris in the opening phase of her Senate run is to keep former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa from joining the race -- or at least to make the contest more difficult for him should he decide to jump in., Sen. Barbara Boxers announcement that she will not seek reelection put an end to years of frustration on the part of a younger generation of California politicians who can now start elbowing their way upward in the states first wide-open U.S. Senate race since 1992., Californias strongly Democratic..., Sen. Barbara Boxers announcement that she will not seek reelection put an end to years of frustration on the part of a younger generation of California politicians who can now start elbowing their way upward in the states first wide-open U.S. Senate race since 1992., Californias strongly Democratic..., Indeed, for Harris, the ritual of rolling out endorsements appears more and more to be largely about Villaraigosa, a fellow Democrat whose allies say he is likely to announce his candidacy any day., First, she announced the support of two prominent Los Angeles African Americans: City Council President Herb Wesson, a longtime Villaraigosa ally, and county District Atty. Jackie Lacey. Their support for Harris, who is black, suggested Villaraigosas historically strong support among African Americans could be in peril., Next came a series of Latino endorsements of Harris: Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia, Assemblyman Jose Medina (D-Riverside), San Francisco City Atty. Dennis Herrera and former state Democratic Chairman Art Torres., Villaraigosa, who would be Californias first Latino senator, would need strong Latino support in the June 2016 primary to help offset Harris Bay Area stronghold., Now, the police unions support of Harris serves as a reminder that Villaraigosa would face a serious risk that organized labor would rally behind the attorney general -- a formidable threat in any statewide campaign. The education agenda that Villaraigosa pursued as mayor turned powerful teachers unions into staunch adversaries., Aggravating the natural tensions that any mayor faces with municipal unions, Villaraigosa had the misfortune of governing Los Angeles when the 2008 economic crisis struck, ravaging the citys finances. The police unions nearly 10,000 officers went without raises for three years on his watch., Law enforcement unions were no friend of Harris when she first ran for attorney general in 2010. Statewide, nearly all of them opposed her after she refused, as San Franciscos D.A., to seek the death penalty in prosecuting the killer of city Police Officer Isaac Espinoza., During her first four years as attorney general, Harris worked hard to win the unions support for her reelection -- and most of them indeed endorsed her. Craig Lally, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, said he was especially moved that Harris had traveled far and wide to attend the funerals of slain officers., Shes amazing with that, Lally said., If many other law enforcement unions follow the leagues lead in backing Harris for Senate, it would bolster her law-and-order credentials.

{"Content": "[[, In case you missed it, heres what former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush had to say last week when asked about people who come to America illegally to make better lives:, \"Yes, they broke the law, but its not a felony. Its an act of love. Its an act of commitment to your family. I honestly think that that is a different kind of crime  that there should be a price paid, but it shouldnt rile people up that people are actually coming to this country to provide for their families.\", And heres what another possible GOP presidential contender had to say about the subject. \"Theres no doubt that immigrants come to this country because they are seeking a better world,\" said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). \"What isnt positive and beneficial is breaking the law to do so.... Rule of law matters.\", You might think from those two statements that Bush and Cruz are far apart on immigration reform, but theyre not. They both support offering illegal immigrants a way to apply for legal residency in the United States. They both oppose giving those immigrants a clear path to citizenship, at least for now., Where they differ  dramatically  is on how they want that immigration policy to sound. Bush wants the discussion to be about practicality, economic opportunity and compassion. Cruz prefers to focus on border security and defending the rule of law., Their parsing of words is important. Bushs tune appeals to moderates and the Republican business establishment, which wants easier immigration rules for engineers and other professionals. Cruzs tune appeals to law-and-order conservatives  and, of course, to nativists, even if Cruz, a Canadian-born Cuban American, isnt among them., But both views make it clear that at least some Republicans with an eye to high office are less worried about offending the most conservative members of their party than they are about alienating Latino voters., As Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus noted in his postmortem on the 2012 presidential campaign, a candidate who expresses compassion for immigrants stands a better chance of winning votes from Americas biggest ethnic minority than a candidate who dismisses the idea as softheaded. Every GOP politician knows the numbers: George W. Bush won 44% of Latino votes in 2004; Mitt Romney, who advocated \"self-deportation,\" won 27% in 2012., Still, the Republican path forward isnt obvious. The GOP-led House of Representatives has been stymied on the issue, unable to present a conservative alternative to the \"path to citizenship\" that passed the Democratic-run Senate last year. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) says he wants to pass a bill that includes that path to legalization (but not citizenship) that both Bush and Cruz endorse., But when Boehner unveiled his proposals in January, his right-wing members erupted in rebellion, arguing that any vote on immigration reform would needlessly divide their caucus and alienate conservative voters., The House GOP is so allergic to any measure that looks like amnesty that, last week, it shelved one of the mildest of all legalization proposals: a bill that would have offered a path to citizenship for migrants who entered the country as children if they serve in the U.S. armed forces., The right thing to tell illegal immigrants who want to enlist in the U.S. Army, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) said, is: \"We have a bus for you to Tijuana.\", The inability to agree on immigration reform might not hurt the GOP in the short run, but unless Republicans act, it will come back to bite the party in 2016., In this years congressional election, Republicans hope to win a majority in the Senate mostly by turning out conservative voters riled up about Obamacare. A messy fight over immigration reform might get in the way of that message, or so some in the GOP ranks have argued., But in the presidential election of 2016, every Republican this side of Steve King knows that if the GOP sounds like the anti-immigrant party, its candidate is likely to lose again., \"Its really hard to get people to listen to you on economic growth, on tax rates, on healthcare, if they think you want to deport their grandmother,\" said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), another potential presidential candidate., Its a classic dilemma that pits short-term pain against long-term gain. Unless House Republicans pass some kind of immigration bill, 2016 is going to be a tough year for any GOP presidential candidate. But if they act too soon, some of the conservatives they need to turn out for this years midterm elections might stay home., So, naturally, some Republicans are urging Boehner to wait until next year. But theres no guarantee that next year will be much easier., \"They cant move until they find a consensus on this issue in the House,\" a GOP strategist told me. \"That consensus doesnt exist.\", For members of Congress in safe seats, thats not a job-threatening problem. But those considering a run for president  including Rubio, Bush and Cruz  have to be hoping that consensus comes together long before 2016., doyle.mcmanus@latimes.com, Twitter: @DoyleMcManus]", "Date": "20140408", "Title": "[ The GOP's 2016 handicap -- immigration ]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-mcmanus-column-jeb-bush-20140409-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, In her first extended public remarks about the recent deadly attacks in Paris, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Wednesday that Americans \"cant close our eyes\" to the \"dangerous strain of extremism within the Muslim world.\", Speaking at a luncheon in Winnipeg, Canada, Clinton said that Western democracies are engaged in a \"contest of ideas and values\" that she characterized as a \"generational challenge.\", \"The slaughter of satire writers and Jews and police officers sharpened the true contours of this struggle,\" she said., \"Were not contesting against the vast majority of Muslims,\" who are \"peaceful and tolerant people,\" Clinton added. \"But we cant close our eyes to the fact that at this time in our world history, there is a distorted and dangerous strain of extremism within the Muslim world that continues to spread., Radical Islamistsare \"few in number\" but have \"the capacity to cause huge damage,\" Clinton said, adding that \"we are confronting an ideology of hate\" that is \"based on a claim to absolute truth and total intolerance for the beliefs and rights of their fellow human beings., In her remarks, Clinton, who is widely expected to make an announcement this spring that she is running for president, also talked of the need to reverse the trend of rising income inequality in the U.S. and other developed nations. She noted that Canada had adopted policies that have slowed the growth of inequality in that country., The proposals that President Obama outlined in his State of the Union speech Tuesday night were an \"important start for a critical debate,\" she said., In a question-and-answer session after the speech, which was sponsored by the Imperial Bank of Canada, Clinton declined to offer an opinion on the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which would run from Canadas tar sands deposits to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The pipeline is under review by the State Department, and Clinton said that commenting on it while it is \"in our process\" would be inappropriate., She offered strong support forObama in his confrontation with Congress over further sanctions against Iran., The U.S. and five other world powers have been negotiating with Iran over the future of itsnuclear program, attempting to head off the possibility that Tehran is developing atomic weapons., With the negotiationsfacing a June deadline, many members of Congress in both parties have argued for new sanctions legislation that, they say, would put added pressure on Iran to come to terms. Obama argues that new legislation could cause the collapse of the talks. Clinton adopted that argument., Insofar as we know,\" she said, \"the Iranian nuclear program has been put on hold by the current interim agreement between Tehran and the other governments. Circumstances are moving in our direction, and what could blow it up would be for the United States to give an excuse for other countries to break ranks., If the U.S. Congress imposes sanctions now, she said, then I think its highly likely that Russia and China would break with the U.S. That would be a very serious strategic error., Why do we want to be the catalyst for the collapse of negotiations?, Clinton did differ from the administration on another foreign policy issue, however -- aid to Ukraine. The U.S. should give \"new equipment\" and training to allow Ukraine to defend its borders, she said.

{"Content": "[[, In his first public remarks since telling GOP donors that he is weighing a third bid for the White House, Mitt Romney suggested Friday that if he does run he would alter the focus that led to his loss in 2012 to President Obama., I believe in the post-Obama era we need to stand for safety, and for opportunity for all people, and we have to stand for helping lift people out of poverty, Romney told hundreds of Republican National Committee members and their guests at a dinner aboard the aircraft carrier Midway, berthed in San Diego Harbor., He specifically cited income inequality and the scourge of poverty  elements he rarely discussed in 2012. A familiar note was his emphasis on a muscular foreign policy; in a new twist, Romney sought to tie likely Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton to Obamas overseas policies he criticizes., I am giving some serious consideration for the future, he said. But this I know  we can win in 2016 ... if we communicate a clear vision of where were taking this country., Romneys change of emphasis was apparent not only in his choice of issues but in his remarks about the 10 years he spent as a Mormon bishop. He rarely discussed those experiences during his 2012 or 2008 campaigns, instead focusing on his business career., The former Massachusetts governor said his wife, Ann, understood his heart, and indicated she supported another campaign., She believes that people get better with experience, he joked as the crowd applauded, and heaven knows that I have experience running for president., Romney and his wife had been emphatic that he would not run again. He began reconsidering recently and made it public after former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush announced in December that he might run., In choosing to address the RNC, Romney placed himself in front of influential party leaders from across the nation. Speaking in interviews, several committee members expressed surprise at his renewed interest and warned that he would be starting from scratch like other potential candidates in a crowded 2016 field., Three other possible presidential candidates spoke at the RNC winter meeting at the historic Hotel del Coronado., Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who ran and lost in 2012, has been working to change the image created by his poor debate performance and stumbling campaign. Perry, who leaves office Tuesday after 14 years, acknowledged that he was deciding whether to run but offered little in his speech other than familiar praise for job creation in Texas and strong criticism of Obamas immigration and foreign policy., What is at stake is the preservation of Western values, he said at one point. What is required is not moral confusion but moral clarity., Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, in a poke at Romney and other veteran candidates, told Republicans on Thursday night that the party needed a new fresh leader with big bold ideas and a proven track record., Walker lacks the name recognition and fundraising base of Romney, Bush or New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. But he received a warm response from the crowd as he argued that he implemented a conservative agenda in his state that could serve as a template for the presidency., Common-sense reforms  a phrase he used repeatedly  can work not just in Wisconsin, but they can work all across America, he said., Dr. Ben Carson, a neurosurgeon popular among conservatives who also is flirting with a presidential run, warned that Republicans must avoid being cowed by political correctness., We must be willing to stand up for what we believe in, he said., Bush was in Southern California raising money for his political action committee and greeting influential Republicans, but he did not make an appearance at the four-day gathering., The 2016 field has the potential to be the most crowded in decades, which Republicans tried to spin as a positive, with many choices for voters. Democrats are almost certain to nominate Clinton if she decides to run, a scenario that Republican Party Chairman Reince Priebus contrasted with the spirited contest the GOP expects., Theres intrigue, theres drama, its interesting. I think thats all great for our party. I think the other side is boring, stale, day-old bread that weve all seen before, Priebus told reporters shortly after being elected to a historic third term as the partys chief. The question and the challenge for our party, and its very honest I think, given that drama, intrigue and interest: what we can we do as a national party to make sure that process doesnt get out of control., During the gathering, the party announced moves to compress its nomination process, a move aimed at avoiding a repeat of 2012. Many Republicans believe Romney was badly damaged during that years primaries by nearly two dozen debates and a prolonged selection process., This week, the party announced that its nominating convention would take place in July 2016, more than a month earlier than years past. It also announced nine sanctioned debates  fewer than half the number of last time  with the warning that candidates who participate in unofficial debates would be barred from participating in RNC forums., seema.mehta@latimes.com, cathleen.decker@latimes.com, Twitter: @latseema; @cathleendecker, , ]", "Date": "20150116", "Title": "[Mitt Romney returns to stage with vow to fight 'scourge of poverty']", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-republicans-romney-20150117-story.html", "Author": "[Seema Mehta, Cathleen Decker]"}
{"Content": "[[, In its third editorial endorsing Republican congressional candidate Carl DeMaio over Democratic incumbent Scott Peters, the U-T San Diego newspaper had one description of DeMaio that not even his many critics could dispute: \"One of a kind.\", DeMaios hard-charging style, combined with his anti-Washington pledge to \"Fix Congress First,\" has turned the 52nd Congressional District race into one of the tightest and costliest in the country, with spending by the campaigns and independent committees expected to top $10 million., It might also be among the nastiest, with the candidates complaining of distortions and smear tactics, and a former DeMaio campaign worker accusing him of sexual misconduct., Nonpartisan analysts rate the 52nd as one of the few \"toss-up\" congressional races in the country  one that could help the GOP strengthen its House majority by ousting a one-term Democrat., If elected, DeMaio, 40, would be a rarity in Washington: an openly gay Republican member of Congress., The former San Diego City Council member tells voters that he is a \"new generation Republican\" and a \"proud gay American,\" determined to make government efficient and keep it out of issues such as abortion and marriage. He has openly criticized his party for using social causes as \"wedge issues\" and for its role in pushing the government to a near shutdown., Peters, 56, an environmental lawyer and former City Council member, portrays DeMaio as a follower of the tea party. Political action committees backed by the conservative billionaire Koch brothers have contributed to DeMaio., Peters commercials warn that DeMaio would vote to cut Medicare and student loans; one commercial has a video of DeMaio speaking to a tea party gathering about \"our collective movement.\", At a debate at KGTV-Channel 10, DeMaio blamed Peters for the budget showdown last year that threatened to close the government, telling him: \"It was the wrong thing to do.\", Peters responded by accusing DeMaio of taking credit for projects in the city  including a homeless shelter  \"even though he voted against them.\", Each paints the other as being on the political extremes., \"When youre to the left of Jimmy Carter, youre out of step with San Diego,\" DeMaio said as he fixed Peters with a stare., When DeMaio noted the lack of comprehensive immigration legislation, Peters shot back, \"Your tea party wont let it happen.\", Issues aside, the race has become a kind of referendum not on the incumbent but on DeMaio and the controversies that often surround him. In a routine midterm election season, the Peters-DeMaio fight has taken center stage locally and attracted national media attention., In Washington, Peters, known for a cautious, understated demeanor, has supported the interests of San Diegos high-tech businesses and funding for its military bases. He is supported by Planned Parenthood, the Sierra Club and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce., To his supporters, DeMaio is the kind of passionate reformer needed to shake up Washington just as he did City Hall, where he attacked government workers salaries and pensions as bloated., When then-Mayor Jerry Sanders, a fellow Republican, and other officials thought it was time to ask voters for a half-cent sales tax to bolster city services, DeMaio led the opposition. He said voters should not be asked for more money until the city further reduced spending on employees; voters agreed with DeMaio., The conservative U-T editorial page finds him a smart and insightful person who \"burns inside with a desire to change things for the better.\" The liberal weekly San Diego CityBeat labels him self-centered and \"utterly detestable\" and has pleaded with voters to support Peters., \"Scott Peters big disadvantage is being a Democrat in a year the president isnt popular,\" said Carl Luna, political science professor at San Diego Mesa College. \"Carl DeMaios big disadvantage is being Carl DeMaio  he was a divisive figure on the council, lost for mayor and simply isnt a cuddly politician.\", In the final weeks of the current campaign, a new element has been added: what the moderator at a Conservative Order of Good Guys debate last week called the \"800-pound gorilla in the room.\", A 28-year-old former campaign worker said he told police in June that DeMaio touched him inappropriately, masturbated in front of him and then offered him $50,000 to keep quiet., DeMaio, speaking at a news conference, accused the ex-campaign worker of fabricating the allegations after he was fired for plagiarism, and claimed that the ex-worker is a prime suspect in a break-in at the campaign office., DeMaio said police sex-crime detectives had interviewed him and other campaign workers. He also said Police Chief Shelley Zimmerman called him in August to say the investigation was complete and that he had been cleared. Zimmerman has declined to confirm or deny DeMaios version of the phone call., Dist. Atty. Bonnie Dumanis, a Republican, has rejected calls from Democratic officials to recuse her office from the sexual misconduct and burglary cases. She endorsed DeMaio for mayor in 2012 and DeMaio held fundraisers for her in her successful bid for a fourth term., DeMaio has faced accusations of sexual misconduct in the past. State Sen. Ben Hueso (D-San Diego), a former council member, told a reporter in 2013 that he saw DeMaio masturbating in a City Hall bathroom during a break in a council meeting., DeMaio denied Huesos allegation and the issue faded from headlines with no official action or police inquiry., A U-T and KGTV poll before the recent allegations broke showed DeMaio with a slim lead within the margin of error., It is not just Democrats who have questioned whether DeMaio would be effective in Washington. Eleven former chairmen of the local Chamber of Commerce  10 of them Republicans  have endorsed Peters., And when Democrat Bob Filner resigned as mayor last year amid allegations of sexual harassment, Republican kingmakers met privately in La Jolla to choose a GOP candidate to back for mayor. Over the objections of U-T publisher and owner Douglas Manchester, who favored DeMaio, the group chose mild-mannered Councilman Kevin Faulconer., DeMaio, who lost to Filner in the 2012 mayors race, had already begun campaigning for Congress and says he never intended to switch to the mayors race., Peters unseated Republican Brian Bilbray two years ago when Democratic turnout was bolstered by a presidential election. The 52nd District includes Coronado, Poway and a northern swath of the city of San Diego. Registration is 34% Republican, 32% Democrat, 29% independent., Local television is filled with attack ads. Peters warns that DeMaio plans to cut student loans. DeMaio says he is a big supporter of student loans and Medicare and that Peters represents everything that is wrong with politics: officeholders who are too comfortable with the status quo., Asked by a reporter to name three of its most important endorsements, the DeMaio campaign listed the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., the National Federation of Independent Business and the Latino American Political Assn., On Friday during a joint appearance on KNSD, Peters said that his campaign received information about DeMaios campaign plan after the spring break-in of the DeMaio campaign office but that he never looked at it and instead had it turned over to police. DeMaio responded that Peters admission is proof that the break-in was \"politically motivated.\", Jess Durfee, chairman emeritus of the county Democratic Party, led a protest outside a DeMaio fundraiser where the headliner was House Speaker John Boehner. Protesters waved signs, including one that read \"Dirty DeMaio.\", Local Republican leader Tony Krvaric said he is confident that voters will reject the sex allegations against DeMaio as a vile smear campaign against a proven reformer., tony.perry@latimes.comTwitter: @LATsandiego, 3:10 p.m. PST: This post has been updated with a new quote from Republican leader Tony Krvaric., This post was originally published Oct. 18 at 10 a.m.]", "Date": "20141018", "Title": "[Costly, nasty battle rages in San Diego race for Congress]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-pol-52nd-congress-san-diego-20141019-story.html", "Author": "[Tony Perry]"}
{"Content": "[[, In Los Angeles, its hard to miss the signs of a city straining to meet its existing duties: broken pavement, illegally dumped furniture, rows of tents under freeway bridges., It took a discrimination lawsuit to persuade the citys leaders to start repairing sidewalks in a major way. Officials have just started to acknowledge that trash removal from city streets is a big problem. And from the latest estimates, homelessness, and the number of outdoor encampments, is on the rise., Now L.A. City Council members are poised to create a new office to enforce local wage laws, part of a larger push to require a $15-per-hour minimum wage by 2020. How much that office will cost, and whether it will experience the same funding woes that have befallen other city agencies, is an unresolved question., A UC Berkeley research team told the council that its new Wage Enforcement Division would need 25 investigators to match the efforts of San Francisco, which it views as having the best-developed program on enforcement. That would leave L.A. with one investigator for every 20,000 low-wage workers by the time the minimum wage reaches $15 an hour, the team said., What the council approved, for the time being at least, is $500,000  enough for five analyst positions for the fiscal year that starts July 1., For some, thats not enough to ensure the city gets off to a strong start in enforcing laws on wages, overtime, retaliation and other compensation issues., \"They approved whats basically a third of the need,\" said Elena Popp, executive director of the Eviction Defense Network, a backer of the recent wage hike. \"We need enforcement now. Theres wage theft now.\", Council members say they will have time to ramp up staffing as the wage increases start to take effect. Lawmakers are hoping to give the office at minimum an additional$200,000 by 2016, the year the first wage increase  $10.50 per hour  is in place. Advocates of the higher wage say more money is needed both for added enforcement efforts and to hire community groups to reach out to low-wage workers, particularly those who do not speak English., Meanwhile, critics question whether the city should take on additional oversight duties when it is struggling to get compliance with other laws. \"The city will readily tell you they already dont have enough personnel to enforce their building and safety regulations,\" said Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., Neighborhoods groups already complain the city fails to confirm that real estate firms follow through on the promises they make when their development projects are approved. And Dennis Hathaway, president of the Coalition to Ban Billboard Blight, said the citys record of punishing companies with illegal outdoor advertising is \"abysmal.\", The city currently has two inspectors to patrol more than 5,700 existing \"off-site\" signs, such as billboards and supergraphics, which must be checked every other year. If those two inspectors work 40-hour weeks, with no sick days and two weeks of vacation each year, they would need to inspect 1.4 billboards every hour of every work day., That leaves little time to crack down on unpermitted signs popping up in Hollywood, the Westside and elsewhere, Hathaway said. \"I dont think its a matter of not wanting to do it. I think its a matter of not having the personnel to do it,\" he said., Building and Safety spokesman Luke Zamperini said his agency has \"an adequate number\" of sign inspectors. But he agreed that his department has too few inspectors to tackle code violations, such as unpermitted construction, garage conversions, trash-filled yards and nuisances created by hoarders in and outside of their homes. \"There is simply not enough funding,\" he said., Enforcement problems havent been confined to building safety. Larry Gross, who sits on the commission that oversees the Department of Animal Services, said there have been days when the San Fernando Valley  which makes up roughly 40% of the citys population  had only one animal control officer. Those officers are charged with handling reports of animal abuse, barking dogs and other violations., After years of neglect, the city approved enough money this year to hire an additional 24 animal control officers. But other agencies are facing budget dilemmas., The Ethics Commission, which enforces campaign contribution laws, has five people  three investigators and two managers  to look into major violations by politicians, campaign consultants, city contractors, lobbyists and donors. In the 2013 city election, there were 60,756 separate campaign contributions., Enforcement also is expected to be an issue when the City Council takes up a proposal to legalize street vending later this year. Council members are hoping to create a regulatory system that would allow vendors to obtain permits to sell on public sidewalks. But officials estimate there are as many as 50,000 vendors on the streets and more staff would probably be needed to ensure the new rules are followed., The least-expensive option would be to hire five investigators at a cost of $500,000, roughly one staffer every 10,000 vendors, city analysts reported recently. Under that approach, enforcement would only be triggered by complaints. To have active patrols looking for illegal vendors, the city would need to spend $1.7 million annually for 17 staff members, officials said. ., On the issue of wage theft, the councils new enforcement office would have the power to interview workers and subpoena payroll records. Businesses would be required to post information on L.A.s wage law in 12 languages, including Tagalog, Armenian, Farsi and Chinese  both Cantonese and Mandarin. Employers would face fines if they fail to give investigators access to payroll documents and their workers., Some advocates for the minimum wage hike have been diplomatic in their comments on the early enforcement plan. Alexandra Suh, who heads the Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance and is part of the Raise the Wage Coalition, said five employees is a \"good start.\" But at least 15 more staffers will be needed to make the office effective, she said., Councilman Paul Koretz, who pushed for the creation of the wage theft office, said there is still time to determine how many staffers will be needed. He predicted at least five more employees will be hired during the coming budget year., \"We need to staff up to the point where we are nailing every single person  thats violating the law and stealing from their employees,\" he said., david.zahniser@latimes.com, Twitter:@davidzahniser]", "Date": "20150608", "Title": "[Will L.A. put money behind wage theft crackdown?]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/cityhall/la-me-wage-theft-funding-20150608-story.html", "Author": "[David Zahniser]"}
{"Content": "[[, In many close election contests, candidates run to the middle. Not Paul Chabot., The Republican military veteran vying for a congressional seat in an increasingly Democratic Inland Empire district is trumpeting his conservative views. He is embracing endorsements from gun-rights advocates and anti-abortion groups., Analysts give a slight edge to his Democratic opponent, Redlands Mayor Pete Aguilar, in the spirited battle to succeed retiring Rep. Gary Miller (R-Rancho Cucamonga). Miller won the seat two years ago, after a surfeit of Democratic candidates splintered their partys vote in the top-two primary and he ended up on the fall ballot against another Republican., Democrats, who hold a six-point registration advantage over Republicans in the district, see the race as one of their best opportunities to pick up a House seat this year. That doesnt seem to faze Chabot., \"This district has a lot of Democrats,\" Chabot, 40, said in a recent interview. \"But theyre conservative, middle-class or working-class Democrats., \"....There are a lot of veterans, a lot of highly religious\" people with whom he believes his views and personal redemption story  he was an alcoholic at age 12  are resonating., Aguilar, 35, was one of the Democrats who ran for the seat in 2012, and party leaders urged him to try again this year. He has charted a middle course., He says his \"proven track record\" of balancing city budgets, fostering job growth and \"reaching across party lines to get things done\" is more in tune with the districts voters, 21% of whom are not affiliated with a political party., \"I have the same shared values that this district has,\" Aguilar said in an interview last week. \"They want someone they know they can trust on the important issues of the day that will move the middle class forward.\", Despite the Democrats registration edge and other factors that favor Aguilar, the political environment this year is unfavorable for the party, said Cal State San Bernardino political scientist Brian Janiskee., He pointed to President Obamas low standing in the polls and the fact that Democrats have historically been less consistent voters than Republicans  especially when there is no presidential race on the ballot., Those tendencies and the low voter turnout that most experts predict could give some Republicans an advantage. \"A low-turnout dynamic,\" Janiskee said, could help Chabot \"keep the race close.\", The contest is getting a lot of attention locally. A campaign forum featuring both candidates last week drew a near-capacity crowd to the 1,300-seat chapel at the University of Redlands., Both candidates have local roots  Chabot grew up in Riverside and Aguilar in San Bernardino., Chabot said his family was poor, and he was raised by his single mom and his grandmother. He started drinking and smoking marijuana when he was 10, ending up in rehab at 12., He cleaned up, later graduated from high school and eventually earned degrees from Cal State San Bernardino, USC and George Washington University. An Iraq War veteran, Chabot remains an officer in the Naval Reserve., He worked for the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy in both the Clinton and Bush administrations. He was a police officer at USC and is a reserve sheriffs deputy for San Bernardino County. He owns a consulting firm specializing in national security and counter-terrorism., Chabots endorsers include those from the National Right to Life Council, the National Rifle Assn., the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. and TEAPAC, a fundraising arm of the tea party movement. The NRA political arm spent $4,500 to support him, drawing an angry response from the California chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America., He lives in Rancho Cucamonga with his wife, a former probation officer, and four children., Aguilar is married and has two sons., As a teenager in a working-class neighborhood, he bussed tables and washed dishes in the county courthouse cafeteria, which was run by his legally blind grandfather. He attended the private University of Redlands, paying his way with partial scholarships and part-time jobs., After graduation, he went to work in an Inland Empire field office for then-Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat. At 26, Aguilar became Redlands youngest-ever City Council member., In addition to backing from many Democratic elected officials, Aguilars endorsements include those of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund and the California League of Conservation Voters. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has pitched in financially to support Aguilars candidacy., The committee has spent some $713,000 against Chabot, mostly in negative TV ads that portray him as harsh on immigration and chintzy on school spending. (Chabot said that a statement that he wanted a 20% cut in education funds, made during his unsuccessful run in a 2010 state Assembly primary, was taken out of context.), Another Democratic group, House Majority PAC, has pumped more than a quarter of a million dollars into a mail and TV ad campaign to try to defeat Chabot.

{"Content": "[[, In news only slightly more surprising than this mornings sunrise, Hillary Rodham Clinton announced she is running for president again., The announcement came in the form of a clever video, in which Clinton says she wants to be a champion for everyday Americans  an obviously focus-grouped term intended to replace middle class. I like it, but unless theyre very careful, everyday has a condescending tinge that could backfire (synonyms include: dull, unexceptional and commonplace). One can already imagine a Saturday Night Live version of Clinton looking out the window of her private jet: Wow, those everyday Americans look like ants down there., According to most pundits, what made the video clever was that it put people first. The bulk of it is a montage of everyday Americans talking about exciting developments in their own lives: a woman reentering the job market after being a stay-at-home mom; Latino brothers poised to start a business; a gay couple planning their wedding; an interracial couple excited about their move, etc. It ends with Clinton saying, Im getting ready to do something too. Im running for president., See, shes just like you, everyday Americans., The people profiled are a visual checklist of Barack Obamas coalition of the ascendant (Ron Brownsteins phrase): young people, minorities, gays, college-educated whites, single working women, etc. As with pretty much everything Clinton does, that was carefully planned., Most political pros agree that Clinton will need a huge turnout from the Obama coalition to win. The bad news is that, so far, the Obama coalition is like a non-transferable, single-purpose coupon that can only be used to get Obama elected president. Clinton advocates insist we dont know that yet, which is true. But all the evidence looks bad for Clinton., After he was reelected, Obama turned his campaign operation, Organizing for America, into a de facto personal political party with the sole aim of mobilizing his coalition to support his agenda. In the wake of the Sandy Hook school shooting, the newly renamed Organizing for Action made gun control a priority. Obama arguably set the bar for political success low, demanding a congressional vote on his proposals  not actual passage. He made this appeal the emotional centerpiece in his 2013 State of the Union address. Organizing for Action manned the phones, took to the Twitterverse, made a lot of noise on cable TV and  nothing happened., The groups other big priority: making Obamacare popular. That still hasnt happened., In every off-year and midterm election of his presidency, Obama tried very hard to rally his faithful for other candidates, including in the special election for the late Ted Kennedys Senate seat. Obama failed, often spectacularly. After losing the Senate in 2014, Obama petulantly said he heard the voters but added: To the two-thirds of voters who chose not to participate in the process yesterday, I hear you too., Whatever he meant by that, it was also an implicit concession that the Obama coalition isnt a proletarian reserve army that can be mobilized at will, even by Obama., The Clinton campaign has hired Obamas image consultants in the hopes that they can do for her what they allegedly did for him. Theyve even tried to replicate Obamas signature O logo into an exciting H, which mostly looks like a road sign pointing to the next exit for a hospital., The inelegance seems amusingly symbolic. The letter O lends itself to graphic artistry, the letter H, not so much. Its no surprise that consultants think consultants are very important. But turning Clinton into Obama (or Bill Clinton) is beyond their powers., In 2008, the enthusiasm for Obamas novel candidacy was self-evident and organic. His personal appeal was such that his handlers felt he could never be over-exposed., Enthusiasm for Clintons long-expected candidacy, while obviously sincere for many partisans, is more asserted than obvious. Thats why the smartest thing about Clintons announcement video wasnt the testimonials from so many everyday Americans. It was that there was so little Hillary Clinton in it., jgoldberg@latimescolumnists.com, Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion and Facebook]", "Date": "20150413", "Title": "[Obama coalition isn't a coupon that Hillary Clinton can redeem for votes]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0414-goldberg-hillary-clinton-obama-coalition-20150414-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, In other times, maybe even fairly recently, the religious freedom law signed last week in Indiana could have allowed Republican lawmakers to appeal to their core conservative supporters without attracting much notice from the general public. But the blowback against it that has upended the states business and political culture offers a vivid example of the unprecedented speed with which public opinion over gay rights has shifted., The change, stunning to public opinion researchers, has been downright befuddling to politicians and left many out of step with their constituents., \"Was I expecting this kind of backlash? Heavens no,\" Gov. Mike Pence told reporters Tuesday during a televised news conference in Indianapolis., The Republican, a former House member with presidential aspirations, promised to \"work around the clock\" to fix a law that critics contend could allow businesses to refuse service to gays based on a store owners religious beliefs. Pence, who as late as Sunday indicated no change was needed, on Tuesday pledged new legislation \"that makes it clear that this law does not give businesses the right to deny services to anyone.\", Pence stopped short of agreeing to repeal the law as many critics have demanded, and offered no specific suggestions for a fix. And he may have particular trouble squaring his twin promises to prevent discrimination against gays while protecting religious freedom for those who believe serving gay couples goes against their faith., His effort to contain the blossoming political problem came as a growing list of politicians, businesses and celebrities threatened to boycott the state., Angies List, a home-state company with close ties to the Republican political establishment, was among businesses criticizing the law, a sign that some traditional allies have veered away from the party on gay rights in response to changing consumer and employee attitudes. Apples chief executive, Tim Cook, solicited other businesses to join his in fighting such measures., Mark Emmert, president of the NCAA, which is based in Indiana and holds its Final Four college basketball championship in the state this weekend, said on CNBC on Tuesday that the law went against his organizations core values. The NCAA also suggested in a statement that future events in Indiana could be in jeopardy., The most dramatic statement against the states Republican leadership may have come from the Indianapolis Star, which ran a starkly worded editorial on its front page, with more than half the space devoted to the headline \"Fix This Now.\", \"Certainly, right now, theyve lost the message,\" said Patrick Kiely, a Republican who formerly served in the Indiana Legislature and now heads the Indiana Manufacturers Assn. \"On something like this, its hard to get it back, in the world we live in.\", The national divide over the law highlights a conflict between establishment Republicans, who had hoped to shift the partys emphasis away from social issues, and the conservative Republicans who still hold seats in state Legislatures and fuel much of the partys energy as the next presidential election nears., Though 19 other states and the federal government have laws similar to Indianas, the timing of that states religious freedom act has propelled the issue to national prominence. When Bill Clinton signed a less expansive law two decades ago, gay marriage was not legal anywhere. President Obama ran as a gay marriage opponent in 2008, before shifting his support in 2012. Now, the Democratic Party is almost uniformly in favor, but many Republicans still forcefully oppose it, because of religious beliefs or a quest for political advantage., The public campaign against the Indiana law has forced Pence and other potential presidential candidates to confront questions over gay rights that still split the GOP. Despite the fallout in Indiana, lawmakers in Arkansas passed a similar measure Tuesday, a reminder that the issue will continue to reverberate elsewhere even if tempers in Indiana calm., Whit Ayres, a prominent Republican pollster and strategist who is advising Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, said it was urgent that the party figure out how to deal with gay rights, as their acceptance becomes more widespread., \"This is where were headed as a country,\" he said during a breakfast with reporters Tuesday, \"to the point where a political candidate who is perceived as anti-gay  at the presidential level  will never connect with people under 30 years old.\", Still, Rubio was among several potential 2016 candidates in the GOP, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, to stand by Pence and the law. But they expressed their support in terms they hoped would not alienate voters who supported gay rights., \"This is simply allowing people of faith space to be able to express their beliefs. To be able to be people of conscience,\" Bush said in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, noting his home state has a similar law. \"I think once the facts are established, people arent going to see this as discriminatory at all.\", Rubio went a half-step further toward courting social conservatives. \"When youre asking someone who provides professional services to do something, or be punished by law, that violates their faith,\" he said in a Fox News interview. \"Youre violating that religious liberty they have.\", Part of the problem for Republicans is that a majority in their party disagrees with most other Americans on the issue of how to balance the rights of same-sex couples and business owners who might object to their marriages., In a survey last fall by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, Americans were closely divided on the question of whether business owners should be allowed to refuse to serve same-sex couples because of a religious objection, with 49% saying they should be required to serve all customers and 47% saying they should be given a religious exemption., Among self-identified Republicans, there was lopsided support for a religious exemption, 68% to 28%., Americans older than 65 supported a religious exemption, 60% to 36%, and those younger than 30 opposed it, 62% to 35%., \"Equal treatment for gays is really not a left-wing issue anymore, certainly not for our students, and we have a very conservative student body,\" said Gerald Wright, a political scientist at Indiana University., Wright said the Indiana law was seen as particularly hostile to gays because it was passed to appease conservatives after an effort to put an amendment outlawing gay marriage on the ballot stalled in the Legislature. Gay marriage became legal in the state last year as a result of a federal court ruling., Democrats have been looking at the same poll numbers as Republicans, smiling gleefully at the conundrum facing Pence and his party. The Democratic National Committee has been sending reporters a compendium of supportive quotes from GOP candidates along with newspaper editorials condemning Indianas law., \"Being on the wrong side of history is rarely a good thing in politics,\" said Mo Elleithee, a spokesman for the DNC. \"I think thats where most of the Republicans find themselves right now.\", noah.bierman@latimes.com, Twitter: @noahbierman, mark.barabak@latimes.com, Twitter: @markzbarabak, Bierman reported from Washington and Barabak from San Francisco.

{"Content": "[[, In response to the Russian threat, Western leaders at the recent NATO summit reiterated their commitment to defending alliance members in the Baltic and Eastern Europe from aggression. This reaffirmation of NATOs core promise is essential in the short term. But it requires fundamental reconsideration over the next decade. In the long run, it should be up to Europeans to assure the integrity of their eastern frontier without a legal guarantee of U.S. assistance., The United States is overcommitted, confronting ongoing crises in the Middle East and Afghanistan. At the same time, it is undertaking a \"pivot toward Asia,\" which will include a massive shift of military resources to the Pacific. While such a buildup is not a sufficient response to Chinas rise, it is a necessary part of a larger strategy that will provide space for the regions democracies to prosper., Within this global context, it makes sense to require Europe to take on the principal burden of its own defense. When NATO was established in 1949, it was beyond the capacity of a devastated Western Europe to defend itself against the looming Soviet threat. But the continent has come a long way since then. Creating a credible European deterrent is an entirely realistic option, especially since Russias military capacities are limited by its demographic decline and its failure to develop a dynamic market economy., Nevertheless, the European Union wont happily accept this burden, since present arrangements allow it to free-ride on American military expenditure. The United States currently contributes between a quarter and a fifth of NATOs budget, but that figure doesnt include the costs of deploying U.S. personnel on NATO missions. Total U.S. defense spending is 73% of the total spent by all NATO members on defense. As a consequence, Europes leaders have no incentive to consider fundamental changes., Yet it would be in Europes larger interest for them to do so. At present, increasing numbers of ordinary Europeans view the EU as a poorly disguised machine for imposing German austerity on the rest of the continent. Popular support is in sharp decline. Even Euro-stalwarts like France show signs of profound alienation, with the left wing of President Francois Hollandes Socialist Party generating a Cabinet crisis in protest against EU austerity measures while right-wing nationalist Marine Le Pen has become a leading candidate for the presidency in 2017., Rethinking NATO, however, would catalyze a fundamental shift in European politics. Germany, which has a compelling interest in keeping the eastern frontier as far east as possible, would be obliged to make concessions and share much more power with others, generating a renewed sense of genuine collaboration across borders. For obvious historical reasons, German generals could not play a highly visible role in the European army of the future. Much of the high command would probably come from France and Britain. But countries such as Italy, Poland and Spain would also play important roles. The overall appearance would express the EUs collaborative character., Even more important, a focus on European defense would invite politicians and the general public to emphasize the shared commitments to democratic values that link Estonians and Portuguese, Bulgarians and Norwegians in the EU. As President Vladimir Putin has made plain, it is this great enlightenment project, not only principles of territorial integrity, that is threatened when Russian tanks move across borders. If the citizens of the EU make the sacrifices required to rely on themselves rather than America to counter Russian aggression, they will reinforce the sense that Europe is indeed an independently valuable political community., The defense imperative will also drive the EU in more democratic directions. As it accepts responsibility for war and peace, one thing will become clear: Europeans cannot go to war without democratic consent. This common-sense point will create new pressures to reorganize the EUs complex technocratic institutions to become more responsive to the political views of ordinary citizens., Institutional reconstruction is a daunting constitutional task, but it is better confronted sooner than later. Though NATO has been a fixture of American foreign policy for two generations, its future is problematic. In 2016, Rand Paul might be the Republican candidate for the presidency, generating an unprecedented debate on foreign policy fundamentals. Even if he loses, his campaign will set the stage for further challenges to military interventionism from the left as well as the right in future elections., Over time, the credibility of Americas NATO commitment will become increasingly doubtful. Yet so long as the United States bears the principal fiscal burden, it will be tempting for the EU leadership to take NATO for granted until it is too late., Instead of sleepwalking into a disaster, the two sides should set a realistic timetable for a transition. Even after the transfer date arrives  say in 2025  the United States should, of course, continue to cooperate with Europe in its defense. But it should be prepared to put American boots on the ground only as a last resort., Bruce Ackerman, a professor of law and political science at Yale, is spending the academic year as a fellow at the American Academy in Berlin., Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion]", "Date": "20140908", "Title": "[Europe needs to provide for its own defense]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-ackerman-nato-20140909-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, In the aftermath of their crushing defeats in Tuesdays election, Democratic elected officials and strategists have grown increasingly vocal in their complaints about President Obama., The latest salvo comes from Stan Greenberg, the prominent Democratic pollster who conducts surveys for, and is politically close to, the House Democratic leadership., On the central issue of the economy, Greenberg said, Obama was \"out of touch\" and \"tone deaf\" in his insistence on talking about a recovery that many voters dont feel., Middle-class and working-class voters, whose support the Democrats need, \"are living in a different economy than hes speaking of,\" Greenberg said in a briefing for reporters on an election day poll he had conducted., \"He isnt speaking to the main economic problem,\" Greenberg said, adding that the lack of an economic message directed at the anxieties of average families had contributed heavily to low turnout of Democratic voters., Obamas speeches on the economy always include a line about more progress being needed, but they tend to stress the progress the economy already has made., \"The country as a whole has made real progress,\" he declared at a campaign event in Bridgeport, Conn., on Sunday, two days before the election -- a speech much like others he made in the last couple of months., \"When I came into office, we were seeing the worst economic crisis in our lifetimes. Unemployment was about 800,000 per month, we were losing jobs,\" Obama said., \"And over the past 4 1/2years, America has created more than 10 million new jobs. Weve created more jobs than Japan, Europe and all the advanced countries combined,\" he said. \"Theres almost no economic measure where we are not doing better now.\", Greenberg contends that remarks of that sort turn voters off. He made a similar critique in late 2011 and early 2012 when he thought Obamas insistence on talking about recovery was endangering the presidents reelection., During the subsequent campaign, Obama shifted his language, talking less about the nascent recovery and more about the struggles to make ends meet that many families continued to face., This year, however, as the job market has continued to improve -- the unemployment rate fell to 5.8% on Friday -- Obama has moved back toward a sunnier view of the economy., White House advisors have argued that at this point, six years into his presidency, Obamas political standing rises or falls on how the public views the economy. Because of that, the president is right to emphasize the improving numbers, they say., Moreover, polling experts and political strategists alike have wondered why Obama doesnt get more credit for the economic expansion that is now well into its fifth year and showing some signs of accelerating. Polls continue to show large majorities believe that the country is headed in the wrong direction and that the next generation will have a lower standard of living than the current one., One theory has been that after the deep shock of the worst recession since the 1930s, public opinion will not adjust until people have seen several years of steady economic growth., Another school of thought focuses on incomes, which have remained stagnant for most people ever since the late 1990s even as the unemployment rate has dropped. Although the economy has gained ground in recent years, nearly all the income and wealth gains have gone to those at the top of the economic ladder., The argument over how to talk about the economy -- and more importantly what to do about it -- has a strong bearing on the 2016 presidential campaign. The Democratic nominee, whether it beHillary Rodham Clinton or someone else, will need to \"differentiate ... from the president on the economy,\" Greenberg said., For more on politics and policy, follow @DavidLauter on Twitter.]", "Date": "20141108", "Title": "[Obama was 'tone deaf' on economic message, Democratic strategist says]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-blaming-obama-20141108-story.html", "Author": "[David Lauter]"}
{"Content": "[[, In the battle for control of the Senate, Republicans have built their campaigns on a promise to block President Obamas policies and ease Washingtons gridlock., But accomplishing that may prove tougher than winning next weeks election., A GOP Congress would almost certainly pick a quick fight with the White House over Obamacare, immigration and what Republicans see as the administrations anti-coal policies., Problem is, even if Republicans take the Senate, their majority would likely fall short of the 60 votes needed to break a Democratic filibuster, or the 67 votes needed to overcome a presidential veto., Furthermore, many predict that GOP control of both chambers would only heighten long-standing internal divisions. Fiery tea party conservatives would push for sweeping changes, while cooler heads would advocate a more strategic, modest agenda., Party officials, including Kentuckys Sen. Mitch McConnell, who would become Senate majority leader, are already trying to temper expectations. Last week McConnell warned that repealing Obamacare in its entirety may be unrealistic. \"Remember whos in the White House for two more years,\" he cautioned., But tea party activists immediately forced him to backtrack, and he vowed to do his best for full repeal, perhaps by using the upcoming budget process., After years of playing opposition to the White House and Democratic-controlled Senate, Republicans  if they win Congress  will need to step up with credible, workable legislative solutions., Critics note that despite GOP demands to repeal the Affordable Care Act, they have yet to offer a viable alternative. They want to end Obamas temporary deportation reprieve for some immigrants, but cant agree on their own reform plan., GOP leaders know it will be important to prove to voters that Republicans can govern effectively, especially if they want any chance of capturing the White House in 2016. That means avoiding a repeat of last years government-shutdown politics, which drove approval ratings for Congress to all-time lows., If Republicans control both chambers, theyll inherit a dismal record, and the next Republican presidential nominee is counting on them to turn it around., \"What every party does  its just human nature  when they come out of a big victory they take it as a mandate and they take it as a sign that everything theyve done is right,\" said Amy Walter, national editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, at a recent Bipartisan Policy Center forum. \"That path is not one that is going to benefit Republicans in 2016. Looking like a party that can govern, looking like a party that has a message, that is the much bigger challenge for the Republican Party right now.\", So while there may be a few symbolic, far-reaching legislative proposals at first, perhaps the best that a GOP-controlled Congress can hope for is to pass a string of relatively modest measures that could garner enough Democratic votes to avoid a filibuster. One possible bipartisan proposal would be a bill to legalize over-the-counter birth control, something several Republicans have mentioned in their campaigns. Others involve trade or business tax reforms., On thornier issues, Republicans will try to pass narrow bills with help from a handful of moderate Democrats, and then dare Obama to veto them., Heres how a GOP-controlled Congress is likely to approach several key issues:,  Obamacare: No issue has motivated conservatives more than Obamas signature healthcare law. Its repeal continues to be a top goal of most Republican candidates., But pulling out the law by \"root and branch,\" as McConnell has promised, seems all but impossible without a veto-proof majority. There would also be questions about what happens to the more than 11 million Americans now receiving coverage under the program., Instead, watch for an early attempt at repeal  essentially a \"show vote\"  followed by the slow grind of Congress trying to undo certain parts of the law., Among the provisions targeted are those that key Democrats have indicated they, too, dont like: A tax on medical device manufacturers, the requirement the employers with more than 50 workers offer insurance, and the cuts the law made to high-end Medicare Advantage policies., In his agenda for the new Congress, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said the chamber should \"pass bill after bill\" to gradually undo Obamacare. \"Perhaps President Obama vetoes every one,\" Cruz said. \"But each has powerful appeal.\", The conservative Heritage Action frowns on this piecemeal approach. \"Were going to be pointing out that Obamacare cant be fixed,\" said Heritage spokesman Dan Holler.,  Budget: Passing a federal budget would be perhaps the earliest, and toughest, fight for the new Congress, especially after Republicans badgered Democrats for having failed to pass budgets in recent years., But approving a budget is no easy task when Republican spending priorities dont always align., Republicans will likely double-down on the House-passed blueprint by Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), an ambitious plan from the former vice presidential nominee to cut taxes and government spending while creating a Medicare voucher option for the next generation of senior citizens., But Pentagon spending, once sacrosanct within the GOP, is now fair game among fiscal hard-liners, especially after the 2013 \"sequester\" cuts slashed government budgets across the board. Defense hawks want to restore Pentagon money, but budget hawks dont., Budgeting would be further complicated if Republicans use the budget reconciliation process as a back door to try to pass legislation to repeal Obamacare., The reconciliation process is long and cumbersome, requiring months of Senate floor time. But theres one big payoff: It allows for simple majority passage of the bills that accompany it, rather than the 60 needed to overcome a filibuster., Democrats used budget reconciliation to give final approval to the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Now Republicans are drafting reconciliation instructions to repeal it., Knowing that path would still likely end with an Obama veto, McConnells team has indicated he would take a more direct route by attaching GOP goals to must-pass spending bills that, if vetoed, would threaten a government shutdown.,  Immigration: As happened earlier this year, the immigration battle could lead to impeachment chatter. Republicans have repeatedly vowed to stop Obama if he tries to use his executive power to allow some immigrants who entered the country illegally to remain without fear of deportation, something the president has hinted hell do by years end., \"Acting by executive order on an issue of this magnitude would be the most divisive action you could take,\" Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida wrote in a letter to the president this week., But Republicans are unlikely to agree on how to change immigration laws, or whether to even try. About the only thing they agree upon is the need to beef up border security., But thats a vote that could create more political problems than it resolves. Many Latino voters  who will be crucial to the GOPs future presidential chances  are likely to view such a move as insufficient, even hostile., The last time a Republican Congress passed a border-only immigration bill, Latinos protested in the streets, helping Democrats regain control of both chambers in the 2006 election. The upshot: Republicans will probably punt on the issue.,  Energy and Keystone XL pipeline: One of the easiest potential votes for a new Republican Congress will be to approve the Keystone XL pipeline. The oil pipeline project, which would connect the tar sands of Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, appears to have enough Democratic support to overcome a filibuster and swiftly land on Obamas desk., The White House has not indicated whether it would veto legislation to greenlight the stalled project, and has repeatedly postponed a decision now that the pipeline is tied up in a court battle., Smaller energy-related measures  to undo the Environmental Protection Agencys regulations on coal-fired power plants  are also likely to find broad-based support and, if tacked onto spending bills, could force the president into veto-versus-shutdown battles with Congress.,  Nominations: Nothing angered Senate Republicans more than the Democratic majoritys decision last year to deploy the so-called \"nuclear option\" to change long-standing Senate rules that required 60 votes to advance most nominations., Though McConnell has said publicly that he might reinstate the rule, it really doesnt matter., The reality is, with Republicans in charge, they can defeat any potential presidential nomination  controversial or otherwise  by simply refusing to schedule the vote, always the prerogative of the majority., The Obama administration has prepared for the possibility that confirmations might grind to a halt. It is planning to confirm 25 new judges before the end of the year, while Democrats still control the Senate., With the announced departure of Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr., it remains unclear whether his replacement  whom the White House has yet to name  will be confirmed during the lame-duck session or next year, giving Republicans a chance to use the confirmation battle to launch a broad critique of the Justice Department., If the White House nominates a less polarizing figure than Holder, such as Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr., a GOP Senate would have a more difficult time objecting., The rule change did not apply to legislation or the Supreme Court, which means if a vacancy were to arise on the high court, 60 votes would still be needed to confirm a new justice. That would give Republicans a stronger hand in preventing Obama from adding to the court in his final years., michael.memoli@latimes.com , lisa.mascaro@latimes.com, Twitter: @mikememoli, @lisamascaro]", "Date": "20141031", "Title": "[For Republicans, election victory won't end struggles]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-senate-gop-agenda-20141101-story.html", "Author": "[Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, In the dead of night, his eyes fixed on the ceiling, does Larry Lessig really think: \"It could be me standing on the steps of the Capitol on a frigid January 20th of 2017, being sworn in as president of the United States\"?, Does this Harvard law professor really believe that he can persuade Americans that the only thing that matters is obliterating money from the political system, and once that giant hurdle is leaped, Americans will turn to him to do it?, Well, maybe., \"Obviously from this perspective I think its a long shot,\" he said, \"but I actually think that if we can make a number of steps happen its plausible.\", Plausible in the way that all nutty concepts sound a lot more achievable if broken down into small digestible pieces. What he means is: raising a million dollars by Labor Day to kick off his Democratic presidential campaign. Using that to boost his poll numbers, which in turn would give him a place on the debate stage with the more conventional candidates. Using the debates to romp over the professional politicians and swing America to his side. And managing, somehow, to not get plowed under by the very moneyed political campaign system he is trying to dismantle., The first of those goals may indeed be plausible; Lessig had about half the total in hand as of Thursday, with about three weeks to go. But the others seem a little  no, a lot, no, completely  less so., Lessig is not, after all, Donald Trump, able to promote his non-politician candidacy with the help of billions stashed in his mattress. He is not Ben Carson, the neurosurgeon turned Republican presidential candidate whos moved into the higher ranks with his outsider appeals to parts of the GOP coalition. He is definitely not Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard chief executivewhose bloody firing from that post has received far less notice than her piquant barbs at Hillary Rodham Clinton. And he is certainly not Clinton or Jeb Bush, this years earned-money champions of the two major political parties., He is, instead, a man few people know, outside of academic and Internet circlesat 54, he is director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard, and has worked to free restrictions on Internet interests. Hes also sought to diminish the power of money in politics, most recently with the 2014 Mayday PAC, which raised money to elect like-minded members of Congress. (In eight races the group targeted, two candidates won.), Still, Lessig has his hook  that bright and shiny thing meant to convincevoters of the seriousness with which he is approaching this campaign for president. Hes promising that, were he to defy universal expectations to win the presidency and push through the campaign finance-inflected Citizen Equality Act of 2017, he would resign and leave the rest of the nations worries to his vice president., Campaign promises toserve onlyone term always seem a little daffy. And promises to serve less than a term, after all the trouble of getting there? Daffy doesnt cover it., But that is precisely what Lessig is vowing, were he to destroy precedent and get himself elected in the first place., \"I think the only way to have a strong enough mandate is to make clear I will be there for one reason,\" he said in an interview. Were he a traditional candidate, he said, hed have to grind out positions and \"talk about 10 to 12 issues.\", With attention on them, \"the hardest thing we have to do is what we wouldnt accomplish,\" he said. Ergo, he would \"sacrifice the full presidential term.\", Presidential campaigns these days are giant start-ups, requiring a national staff and hundreds of millions of dollars, and more for the nominees. Lessig is running what his campaign calls a \"decentralized virtual campaign team\" out of San Francisco. Hes also opened an online poll to help choose his vice presidential running mate  in other words, tossing much of the campaign to volunteers. If he doesnt raise enough money by Labor Day, he says, hell return it., Politics has its share of egocentrics and narcissists, so it can seem puppy-kicking cruel to dump on a do-gooder like Lessig, who seems likely not to personally benefit from this effort unless hes a masochist., But, reality intrudes. The craziness of the summer before the presidential year can convince people that anything is possible  Trump is leading in all national Republican polls, after all  but almost all of the time, things presidential are impossible. And Lessigs candidacy  if there ultimately is one  falls squarely into that category., His sole effort, the previously mentioned equality measure, would push through advances to the Voting Rights Act, which has been chipped at by courts and Congress. It would force electoral districts to be drawn fairly and open up more space for non-incumbents using methods that have so far been spurned. It would spur public financing of campaigns, another effort long tried, mostly without success., He insists that all the roadblocks would tumble under the force of his giant mandate. He cites a Wall Street Journal poll from earlier this summer that he said proved changes like he is espousing were \"the No. 1issue\" among Americans., \"This is historically completely anomalous,\" he said. \"It has not been that important to people before. What you typically find is that people are so skeptical  they dont believe the politicians when they talk about it. My bet is when we give a clear way to fix the system it would be easy to fix the system.\", But its not clear that attitudes have changed all that much. Indeed, the poll he cited showed that a third of Americans said their top concern was the power of moneyed interests in politics. But the question measured only a few options, including concern about negative campaigning and whether anything would change regardless of who was elected., The options did not include matters like the economy  the top-ranking issue for most of the last decade  foreign affairs or more concrete issues that the candidates already are brawling over., Oddly enough, given his concern about money, Lessig finds that billionaire Trump is doing a pretty fair job of advancing Lessigs point. At almost every turn of the race, Trump is blasting all the other candidates for soliciting money from donors whose desires they then work to fulfill  the kind of thing Lessig calls \"corruption.\", \"To be in a world where the leading Republican candidate is calling everyone corrupt because of the way they are financing campaigns? What better year is there?\" Lessig asked. \"Now its fair game in the Republican Party  and then why couldnt it be in the Democratic Party?\", He dismisses Clinton and Bernie Sanders, the independent Vermont senator running in the Democratic primary, for not having vowed to make campaign finance and Lessigs other issues their primary focus. Either optimistic or delusional, he thinks there still might just be a chance for him to do what he says they will not., \"I do actually think that if people can see this as a real option, then they might embrace it,\" he said. \"The consolation prize of raising the salience of that for the Democratic Party is worth all the scorn and derision and sleepless nights.\", For political news and analysis, follow me on Twitter: @cathleendecker .

{"Content": "[[, In the first casualty of the 2016 presidential race, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry suspended his campaign Friday amid anemic fundraising and little traction in the polls., Perrys departure, coming days before the second GOP presidential debate, is unlikely to affect the contours of the race, given Perrys lack of support among Republican primary voters. But it appears to mark the end of a 30-year political career of a man once viewed as a swaggering star of the Republican Party., When I gave my life to Christ, I said, Your ways are greater than my ways. Your will is superior to mine, Perry told a conservative gathering in St. Louis. Today I submit that His will remains a mystery, but some things have become clear to me. That is why, today, I am suspending my campaign for the presidency of the United States., Perry did not immediately endorse a candidate in the GOP field, which still boasts 16 White House hopefuls, but he appeared to take multiple swipes at front-runner Donald Trump, whom earlier this year he declared a cancer on conservatism., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, The conservative movement has always been about principles, not about personalities, Perry said Friday. Our nominee should embody those principles. He  or she  must make the case for the cause of conservatism more than the cause of their own celebrity., Perrys efforts to break through in the sprawling GOP field never succeeded, and his fundraising grew so anemic that he had to stop paying campaign staff when he ran out of cash in August. His campaign only raised about $1 million through June 30., Nearly all the money supporting his effort was supplied by a cluster of linked super PACs, which together raised close to $17 million. Most of the super PAC money came from just three donors: The largest checks were written by two Dallas billionaires., Austin Barbour, the Mississippi-based main strategist for the three super PACs supporting the Perry campaign, said the groups still had close to $13 million available., He said he would consult with lawyers and donors this weekend before deciding whether to return the money  or turn their support to another candidate. Its just too early for us to think about that, he said., Barbour said some of the money was going toward organizing and surveying voters in Iowa. Until Friday afternoon, he said, he had remained upbeat about Perrys chances in winning over what he said were a big bloc of undecided voters., To be honest, we kind of thought we were seeing a little bit of light, he said., At this point four years ago, Perry was the front-runner in the GOP field in his first run for president. He had been governor of Texas since 2000, and his state had weathered the recession better than much of the country. He routinely went on hunting trips to states such as California where he would woo businesses to move to Texas because of its cheaper tax rates and laxer regulatory policies. He was charming on the stump and appealed both to business-minded and socially conservative voters., NEWSLETTER:Get the days top headlines from Times Editor Davan Maharaj >>, But that quickly eroded after a series of stumbles, notably a cringe-inducing debate performance. He could name only two of three federal agencies he said he would eliminate as president; \"Oops, he said. His campaign crumbled, and he dropped out before the South Carolina primary. His poor performances were later blamed on the aftermath of back surgery., Since then, Perry had sought to redeem himself. He prepared for the 2016 campaign by holding extensive meetings with conservative policy experts, working with speech coaches and courting donors., But he never recovered from the first impression he made on voters. Since launching his campaign, Perry blitzed the early states but failed to gain traction among voters. In an aggregate of recent national polls, Perry drew the support of less than 1% of Republicans. His low standings meant he never had a shot at making the prime-time debate stage last month in Cleveland or next week at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley., Perry sought to gain attention by being one of the first candidates to go after Trump, and Trump returned fire in signature fashion, suggesting that Perry ought to have to take an IQ test to appear on the debate stage., In his final moment on the presidential stage, Perry warned against falling for the cult of personality over durable life qualities, a clear slight at Trump., Perry said he was optimistic about the partys prospects in the presidential contest and that he had no regrets., We have a tremendous field  probably the greatest group of men and women, he said. I step aside knowing our party is in good hands, and as long as we listen to the grassroots, listen to that cause of conservatism, if we do that our party will be in good hands., I give you this news with no regrets, he added. It has been a privilege and it has been an honor to travel this country, to speak with the American people about their hopes and their dreams, to see a sense of optimism being prevalent despite this season of cynical politics., Times staff writer Joseph Tanfani contributed to this report., @LATseema, MORE POLITICS NEWS:, While GOP candidates gear up for Simi Valley debates, Joe Biden plans SoCal trip, The Latino vote is growing -- but it could be much bigger, Which presidential campaign is winning over Silicon Valley?

To be precise, a roughly 1-foot-in-diameter, dark plastic portable fan tucked under the lectern used by Charlie Crist, Floridas former Republican governor who is seeking a repeat term as a Democrat., Crist, known for his immaculate silver hair, flawless tan and obsessive attention to his appearance, doesnt go anywhere without his fan. On the campaign trail, an aide always has one at the ready so that no one ever need see the once and perhaps future governor sweat., But Crists rival, incumbent Republican Gov. Rick Scott, insisted that the debate rules prohibited the fan. His aides pointed to a clause that barred the candidates from using electronic devices., As Crist walked onto the stage at Broward College, the debate moderator, Eliott Rodriguez, the anchor of CBS Miami affiliate, told the crowd and the viewing audience that Scott was \"also in the building\" but that \"we have been told that Gov. Scott will not be participating in this debate\" because of Crists fan., Members of the audience hooted and booed. Crist, looking much like a schoolboy who has been told he could have an extra 45 minutes of recess, did his best to take advantage of the moment, as Rodriguez and his two fellow panelists struggled to decide what to do., \"Are we really going to debate a fan?\" Crist asked., About six minutes into the scheduled debate time, Scott finally walked onto the stage. He later sought to explain his initial absence by saying he hadnt been sure Crist would show up., Crist, for his part, said simply, \"Is there anything wrong with being comfortable?\", For the rest of the allotted hour, the two men proved once more how heartily they dislike each other as well as how completely they disagree on issues including global warming, raising the minimum wage, expanding Medicaid, high-stakes testing in schools, the states \"stand your ground\" law on self-defense, and same-sex marriage., Scott, repeatedly referring to his predecessor as \"Charlie,\" accused Crist of not attending to the details of the job while he was governor, saying that Crist had spent his time trying to become vice president and run for the Senate., The Republican incumbent also repeated a charge aired in his television ads, saying that Florida had lost more than 800,000 jobs during Crists tenure as governor, which began in January 2007., \"Charlie is a lot of talk,\" Scott said, \"not a lot of action.\", \"The people of Florida know I didnt cause the global economic meltdown,\" Crist responded., Often after a debate, both sides battle over what voters will remember.

{"Content": "[[, In the two weeks since he launched his 2018 gubernatorial bid, Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom has raised nearly $727,000 for the contest, according to a financial disclosure statement filed with the California secretary of states office., Prominent Democratic donors were among those who contributed, including Salesforce.com founder Marc Benioff, Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer and Esprit clothing company cofounder Susie Tompkins Buell., Newsoms early launch for a primary election that is still more than three years away was seen as a shot across the bow of other candidates eyeing the race. Gov. Jerry Brown will be termed out of office in 2018., Depending on the field of candidates, the gubernatorial contest has the potential to cost tens of millions of dollars or more. The last time the governors seat was open, in 2010, the race cost more than $200 million, most of it from billionaire former EBay Chairwoman Meg Whitmans personal bank account in an unsuccessful effort., Newsoms fundraising committee allows donors to contribute up to $56,400 each. The former San Francisco mayor also has $3 million left in his 2014 reelection account that he can use., In an interview this month, Newsom said his early start was not intended to scare other candidates out of the race.

{"Content": "[[, In this, the latest installment of the Veterans Kitchen Chronicles, Im happy to report that theres been some progress, although its way too soon to pull out the party hats., CalVet officials now tell me they think they can build a second kitchen in the West Los Angeles Veterans Home by next fall, improving on an earlier estimate of early 2016. Youll recall that the home, completed four years ago, sits half-empty because the kitchen is too small to feed more than 200 residents. Meanwhile, 297 vets are on a waiting list for long-term care., \"Now we have a finish line, and that finish line is October of 2015,\" said CalVet Secretary Peter J. Gravett, who didnt take office until after the kitchen fiasco had begun. \"I can tell you that by January 2016 well be admitting residents.\", Im putting it on my calendar, but Im not holding my breath., In my last column on the subject, I reported that state legislators were more than a little ticked off about the snails pace of the project after freeing up $770,000 in July to get things moving. But Gravett told me Thursday that the money is in fact \"going to allow us to speed up construction of the kitchen by six months.\", Speed, as you know, is a relative term. But as Gravett tells it, the economic crash several years ago, government cuts and the fact that CalVet had several other state homes to run made it difficult to resolve the kitchen issues. Plus, he said, its not as if CalVet hasnt made any progress. Several dozen of the empty beds have been given over temporarily to formerly homeless vets in the West L.A. home., If thats not a very satisfying explanation for the mess, its about as good as any Ive managed to get about why the home was built without an adequate kitchen in the first place., CalVet officials have been telling me their federal counterparts had agreed to provide food services at the $253-million state home but backed out at the last minute, and by 2011, efforts at a resolution had failed. But on Friday, I got ahold of Jeff Blake, a spokesman for the federal VA, who cast the problem in different terms., He said the plan got derailed when the state, in the midst of a budget impasse, couldnt guarantee payment to the feds for the meals, so officials for both agencies \"mutually\" decided to terminate the food agreement., The only thing thats perfectly clear from all this is that theres no bureaucracy like veterans affairs bureaucracies. And in the case of the Kitchen Chronicles, weve got a double dose, with a state CalVet home on federal VA land that has been the subject of controversy for years., \"Ive never seen an organization so weighted down by its own bureaucratic inertia in all my life,\" said L.A. County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky., Thats saying a lot, given that it comes from the representative of a county government that no one could accuse of award-winning efficiency., Now look, I understand the whole thing about different pots of money that can or cant be used for this or that. But in 2010, the U.S. military had a $683-billion budget and spent $171 billion on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the federal Department of Veterans Affairs had a $112-billion budget., Couldnt the feds have scraped together the money to either deliver a few meals to hungry veterans or build the kitchen on a layaway plan, with the state paying up when it was able? Its not as if the feds havent been flexible with other occupants of their 387-acre West L.A. campus., Two weeks ago, the Government Accountability Office ripped the West L.A. VA for mismanaging its property, improperly diverting funds and under-billing clients, leaving potentially millions of dollars uncollected. In one case, a private laundry service was allowed to stay on the property despite having missed payments totaling $300,000., Last year, you may recall, a federal judge slapped the VA for issuing commercial leases on the campus that were \"totally divorced from the provision of healthcare.\" And in 2012, a VA accountant pleaded guilty to theft in connection with a $681,000 embezzlement., That money alone could nearly have paid for the kitchen., \"By and large the people in the system are good people, and the vast majority of them are attracted to the mission and come with great intentions,\" said Dr. Jon Sherin, who once ran mental health operations on the West L.A. VA campus and is now executive vice president of veterans affairs for the nonprofit Volunteers of America. \"But the systems are so inefficient and misaligned and disconnected from their ultimate goal, which is to help people in the trenches.\", Sherin said he thinks the entire under-utilized West L.A. campus, including the CalVet home, should be re-imagined as a far more robust, full-service medical, residential and vocational recovery center to meet veteran needs that will only grow, given the seemingly endless conflicts in the Middle East., Sounds like a grand and ambitious vision.

And he wants stricter rules to make California more reliant on renewable energy sources, part of a broader effort to combat climate change., At the same time, Brown pledged to keep a tight grip on the states finances, aided by voters passage Tuesday of Proposition 2, a constitutional amendment requiring money to be saved in a rainy-day fund., \"Im going to try and do everything I can to keep the state in balance,\" Brown said. \"But I also want to build things.\", He added: \"It is a balance between holding my foot on the brake while pushing my other foot on the accelerator. Its definitely paradoxical.\", Brown will face a series of challenges as he presses forward., Theres vocal opposition to a $25-billion proposal for massive tunnels under the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, a project the governor has pitched as crucial to the states water system., The temporary tax hikes voters approved in 2012 are set to begin expiring in 2016, costing the state some of the income that helped erase perennial budget deficits. Democrats failed to win a two-thirds majority in the Legislature, which could make it tougher to push some proposals through., And in Washington, Tuesdays election left Republicans in complete control of Congress, imperiling efforts to secure more federal funding for the bullet train., Nonetheless, Brown is in a stronger position than \"any politician in the country,\" said Barbara OConnor, professor emeritus of political communication at Cal State Sacramento., He won reelection with nearly 59% of the vote, and Californians overwhelmingly approved the two ballot measures he promoted: Proposition 1, a $7.5-billion water bond, and Proposition 2, which in addition to the savings fund provides for debt repayment., OConnor, who worked in Browns administration during his first term in the 1970s, says she expects the governor to remain more focused than he was in the past., \"His old nature wouldve explored new ideas, new programs,\" she said. \"His new nature is much more disciplined. He has discrete goals that hes been very public about and he will pursue them at the exclusion of extraneous stuff.\", Browns second term, from 1979 to 1983, was tumultuous. He mounted his second of three unsuccessful campaigns for president, and his relationships with California lawmakers deteriorated., \"I was carving out a path that was not sustainable,\" Brown said Wednesday., There were also significant problems he did not expect, a reminder that political fortunes can shift quickly. The state was wrestling with Proposition 13s limits on property tax revenue and an insect infestation  the Mediterranean fruit fly, better known as the medfly  that devastated crops., This time around, the governor has taken steps to ensure that political surprises dont knock him off course. He still has a considerable war chest, which could be used for ballot-measure campaigns  a hedge against lame-duck \"infirmities,\" as he put it in a recent interview., Brown also said he would try to carefully balance his relationships with members of his own party. The trick, he said, is to remain faithful to Democratic ideals without succumbing to budget deficits., \"Combining the hopes for what government can do with putting reins on what it should not do will define a lot of what Im going to do in the next four years,\" he said, \"and will determine how successful I will be.\", Hell be working with a new crop of top lawmakers, state Senate leader Kevin de Len (D-Los Angeles) and Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins (D-San Diego).

He is barred by term limits from serving another term as governor, and he has shot down speculation about running for mayor of Oakland again or mounting another presidential bid., \"I dont like to think about my last campaign.

Nor is she a Big Mac or an iPhone., Shes a human being who has been on the public stage for nearly four decades. And yet, according to the New York Times, she has a team of 200 policy advisors trying to figure out how to \"address the anger about income inequality without overly vilifying the wealthy.\", Brain trusts are fine, but this isnt merely that. Since her days trying to overhaul healthcare, Clinton has been the kind of wonk who thinks you can solve every problem by consulting enough experts and compiling enough data. There are some tasks that lend themselves to such approaches, but electoral politics isnt one of them. Her husband knew that. He may not be able to put the formula in a strategy memo, but Bill Clinton could riff off the cuff in a way that could thread such needles with ease. That natural talent didnt become community property when Bill and Hillary got married; she doesnt have the gift., And so she compensates by controlling the things that she can control: an ever-expanding retinue of consultants and advisors who tell her not to worry about the missing ingredient. Thats what theyre there for., The hitch is that the desperate quest to find a brand is itself a kind of branding. Former Republican Florida Gov. Charlie Crist tried to rebrand himself as a liberal Democrat in his bid to get back his old job. He lost in large part because the only image that stuck was his craven political opportunism, not Charlie Crist 2.0., No doubt many voters  and pundits  will happily buy whatever they come up with for Clinton. But others will focus not on whats new in Hillary 5.0, but what is a constant in all of the versions so far: a purpose defined by the pursuit of power., jgoldberg@latimescolumnists.com, Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion and Facebook]", "Date": "20150223", "Title": "[ Hillary Clinton's identity crisis]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0224-goldberg-hillary-clinton-5-0-20150224-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, Is it possible to create a \"super PAC\" that would end the power of super PACs by drawing enough Americans into the system to limit the influence of big money in politics? And is it possible to get voters excited about a subject as dry as campaign finance?, Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig is leading a crusade to answer both those questions with a yes. On May 1, Lessig launched the Mayday PAC, asking for contributions from Americans across the political spectrum who believe the current political system is legally corrupt--with members of Congress spending much of their time dialing for dollars, as outside groups flood each election cycle with hundreds of millions of dollars through super PACs and other devices, with little disclosure of their donors., The result, Lessig said, has been a government that is not responsive to what the average American cares about, but is incredibly responsive to the people who are in that funding class., The conventional wisdom is that the public doesnt like the system, but the public is not going to do anything about it, Lessig said in an interview in Santa Monica on Thursday during a West Coast swing that included stops to build support for the effort. But the public is not doing anything about it because they dont think theres anything we can do about it., The goal of the Mayday PAC is to get enough Americans involved to dilute the dominance of big money. Small donations from average citizens in each phase will be matched by largercontributions raised by Lessig from high-dollar and even billionaire donors, whom he declined to name. In the first 13 days of the effortwhich was announced simply, with a blog post, a Twitter message and a Web pagethe group raised more than $1.1 million, with an average contribution of $75. Lessig is now raising funds to match that first million, while launching the second phase to raise $5 million in June (which he again hopes to match with bigger donations). , If the group succeeds in raising its goal of $12 million by the end of June, it intends to use the 2014 campaign cycle as a testing ground  targeting five House races to demonstrate whether it can propel candidates who are committed toa system in which small donors have a much greater influence.(The group will announce its targets later this summer.), Lessig and his advisors at the Global Strategy Group, including Bill Burton, the onetime White House aide who cofounded the main super PAC dedicated to helping President Obamas campaign in 2012, have been trying to calculate what it would cost to elect enough members of Congress committed to reform. But for now the goal is simply to convince candidates and voters alike in 2014 that this issue matters to people, Lessig said., If the Mayday PAC is able to take out five members of Congress this cycle who are on the wrong side of this issue, Lessig said, then when 2016 comes around, magically a whole bunch of members of Congress would be on the right side of this issue, and we would have a narrower range of people that we would have to be going after, and we would have very good data from how much it would cost., The Mayday PAC supports five legislative proposals for changinghow elections are funded. Two are Democratic proposals, two are Republican proposals, and one is bipartisan. One proposal would create a $200 voucher forevery American to put toward the candidates of their choice; another would create a tax credit for small donors. Lessig also favors a constitutional amendment that would protect the ability of Congress to make reasonable regulations around election spending from Supreme Court interference., Lessig acknowledged the difficulties--the Supreme Court has steadily loosened campaign finance restrictions and would seem unpersuaded by a contrary super PAC--but he said victory would mean that \"at a minimum we will have changed the way elections are funded., Lessig said he drew his inspiration from two sources: the late Internet activist Aaron Swartz and Doris Haddock, the citizen activist who walked from Los Angeles to Washington in her late 80s with a sign on her chest that said campaign finance reform. In a 2006 conversation, Swartz challenged Lessigs approach to addressing laws that choke creativity in his field of copyright law and Internet policy., How are you ever going to address those problems so long as theres this fundamental corruption in the way our government works? Swartz had asked., Before launching the super PAC this year, Lessig began a companion effort called the \"New Hampshire Rebellion. Lessig and about 200 other people walked nearly the length of New Hampshire, from Dixville Notch to Nashua. They stopped at coffee shops and small events along the way to get people talking about the influence of money in politics., The group will embark on another walk along the New Hampshire coast on July 5, followed by larger walks in 2015 and 2016. By the time the 2016 presidential candidates arrive in earnest next year, Lessig hopes to have legions of New Hampshire voters forcing them to talk about how they would curb the influence of money in politics., The challenge of capturing peoples attention isnt lost on Lessig. When asked if anyone has told him that his idea is ludicrous and unlikely to work, he answers with a smile: Yeah, like everybody., But they were the same people who said you couldnt possibly raise $1 million in 30 days, he adds.\"They were wrong about that too.]", "Date": "20140523", "Title": "[Harvard professor's 'super PAC' aims to end power of 'super PACs']", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-harvard-professor-super-pac-big-money-politics-20140523-story.html", "Author": "[Maeve Reston]"}
{"Content": "[[, It is hard to say when it will come, but our democracy faces a tipping point in the not-to-distant future when a fearful, ticked-off generation of conservative white voters will have passed on and a multiracial, socially liberal generation finally gets the voting habit. When that happens, the Republican Party risks going the way of the 19th century Whigs because, year after year, the GOPs constituency has been growing older and even more white., For the campaign of 2016, though, the demographic advantage still could go to either party., David Horsey / Los Angeles Times, David Horsey / Los Angeles Times, Inspired by the chance to elect and then reelect the first nonwhite president of the United States, young people, blacks, Latinos and Asians joined with white liberals to give Barack Obama solid victories in 2008 and 2012. But, in the midterm elections, the story was different. Determined to defend the conservative hold on the American agenda that was established by Ronald Reagan in the 1980s and solidified by the GOP capture of the House of Representatives engineered by Newt Gingrich in the 1990s, older white voters marched to the polls in 2010 and 2014 to dramatically reinforce Republican power in Congress., The Republican voting advantage in nonpresidential election years is reinforced by a number of factors, including blatant gerrymandering in some states, as well the clustering of Democratic voters in cities, a phenomenon that causes the liberal vote to pack far less punch than its size would warrant. The biggest plus for the GOP, though, may be thatDemocratshave failed to gettheir young, nonwhite voting contingent to show up at the polls when the presidency is not at stake. Backed by their dependable cohort of angry, pale-faced senior citizens, Republicans have grabbed the biggest share of state legislatures and elected the majority of governors in the 50 states. Young Democratic voters, meanwhile, would be hard-pressed to name a single state legislator, even if they were offered a free iPhone and a $500 gift certificate at Urban Outfitters. By a significant margin, Democrats are the more popular party, according to polls, but popularity counts for nothing if it cannot be translated into political victories., So, the central question for 2016 is this: Will the Obama coalition turn out to vote for the first woman to have an inside track to becoming president? Hillary Rodham Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, has many advantages. She bears one of the most famous names in American politics. She has far more experience at the national and international level than any of her likely Republican opponents. Her gender will be a draw for many female voters eager to see history made. But, will the voters who were little kids when she was the young, dynamic first lady be excited about her candidacy or will they look at Clinton and see a white, rich grandmother who has nothing close to Obamas cool, multiracial vibe?, If Clinton can rev up enthusiasm among nonwhite voters and Millennials the way Obama did, she cannot lose. Demographics will simply dictate the outcome. However, if the enthusiasm is simply not there for her  and if the Republicans manage to avoid nominating the kind of gay-baiting, immigrant-bashing, prayer-spouting candidate their primary election electorate would adore, but who would scare off Latino voters and young libertarians  then Clinton could lose and Republicans could sweep the field, from Congress to the White House., If that should come about, Republicans ought to enjoy it while they can.

{"Content": "[[, It is the kind of corruption case that would attract attention even from jaded voters in places like Illinois or Louisiana, with long-established records of shady government dealings. But for Virginians, who have enjoyed generations of relative purity in state government, the spectacle in federal court here is shocking., The ex-governor and his wife are on trial, trying to explain an unconsummated love triangle with a businessman who says he can nuke carcinogens out of tobacco in his kitchen microwave  and thats the defense version of the case., Its a sordid tale involving secret cash transfers, private jets, a male model and an iPhone snapshot of former Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell wearing a very expensive Rolex., McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, are charged with public corruption. Federal prosecutors allege that the couple, financially strapped and eager to live the high life, aggressively solicited cash and gifts from the businessman, Jonnie R. Williams Sr., a local millionaire., In return, prosecutors say, the couple provided state help promoting a nutritional supplement made out of tobacco. The McDonnells admit taking the gifts, but deny giving favors in return., Williams is now the governments star witness, and to try to defuse his testimony, the defense kicked off the trial with a bombshell: The McDonnells marriage had unraveled in the governors mansion, defense lawyers told the jury in opening statements. That, they said, left Maureen McDonnell desperate for attention, and she got it from the jet-setting Williams, on whom she had a \"crush.\", The argument, although undoubtedly embarrassing to the couple, forms a key part of their defense. To convict either of the McDonnells, prosecutors must prove that Bob McDonnell did governmental favors for Williams in return for gifts., If the defense can convince the jury that Williams was motivated by friendship for Maureen McDonnell and that she had kept the governor in the dark about his gifts because she and her husband werent speaking, the couple would escape prison., Richmond, which long viewed itself as immune from the self-dealing that infects other state capitals, has for years resisted imposing gift limits and other ethics laws common in American politics. Showering lavish gifts on politicians is legal in the state, so long as the gift giver doesnt get special favors in return., At the center of the scandal is a purported wonder drug  a nutritional supplement Williams says he invented from tobacco, which he told the jury he learned to make less dangerous with his microwave., Williams testified that he was willing to supply gifts in return for help getting Virginias public medical schools to embrace his product, as well as getting the governor to promote it., The supplement was launched, with much fanfare, at an event at the governors mansion. The states first lady traveled the country with Williams, promoting the product at events with groups of doctors and potential investors., The defense argues that none of that was caused by Williams gifts. Indeed, they say, the governor was largely unaware of the money and presents Williams had given his wife., That could be a hard argument for jurors to accept. Evidence shows Williams gave a $50,000 loan to the McDonnells, paid $15,000 for catering at the wedding of one of their daughters, took Maureen McDonnell on a $19,000 shopping spree at Oscar de la Renta and Bergdorf Goodman in Manhattan and bought the governor an engraved $6,500 Rolex at a jewelry shop in Malibu., On Friday the government showed the jury a photo of the governor wearing the Rolex. McDonnell has said he thought the watch was a gift from his wife, not Williams. But this photo was one texted from the governors phone to Williams. It shows McDonnell flashing what appears to be the watch while smiling a broad grin., In court, Williams described the purchase of the timepiece: \"I called Maureen McDonnell from the store,\" Williams said. \"I asked her, what would you like engraved on the watch? She thought about it. Then she said, Put \"71st governor\" on it.\", He regretted the purchase, he said., \"I shouldnt have had to buy things like that to get the help I needed,\" he said. \"It was a bad decision.\", He did not consider the first couple personal friends, Williams testified. They had \"a business relationship,\" he said: He gave them money and gifts, and they helped him advance his business., Whatever a jury ultimately decides, the case has caused an astonishing fall for the former governor., The congenial McDonnell was known as an effective deal maker and a rising star in the GOP. He received accolades from Democrats and Republicans alike for his style of governance. Throughout most of the one term McDonnell was permitted to serve under Virginias constitution, his relationship with his wife, a former Washington Redskins cheerleader, seemed drawn from a storybook., \"This was the Beaver Cleaver family,\" said Quentin Kidd, a professor of political science at Christopher Newport University in Newport News. \"Everybody knew he was religiously conservative and socially conservative, but he did not play those things up. Nobody expected his family would become a story, or the behavior of his wife [or] his kids would become a story.\", \"Months into this scandal, there were still Republicans saying, There has to be an easy explanation, this cant be as it appears,\" Kidd said., Now, Bob and Maureen McDonnell awkwardly sit feet away at adjoining tables in the courtroom, barely acknowledging one another as they face the prospect of prison terms that could run as long as 20 years  although as first-time offenders they would probably receive less., Beyond the threat of prison, there is also the sheer tawdriness of the evidence., Williams testified that on a luxury vacation for the McDonnells, which he paid for in Cape Cod, he had popped open a $5,000 bottle of cognac and poured the governor a glass. They drank the same cognac again, he testified, while traipsing around New York City with a friend of his who is a male model., Defense attorneys are seeking to discredit Williams as a huckster and fraud. They point to his own considerable legal troubles and suggest he is fibbing to get in the good graces of prosecutors, who otherwise have a thin case., In building the government case, Assistant U.S. Atty. Michael Dry returned repeatedly to the lengths to which Williams went to keep the transactions secret. Instead of lending $50,000 outright to the McDonnells, Williams sought to provide the funds through a complicated transfer of stock certificates, then eventually funneled the money through a real estate company the McDonnell family owned. He testified that his intention was to evade disclosure., \"I didnt want anyone to know what I was doing,\" Williams said. \"I was loaning him money for him to help me.\", While much of Williams testimony was focused on his interactions with the first lady, prosecutors said the governor was very much involved in the solicitations for gifts., They showed the jury several text messages the governor sent to Williams. One read: \"Per voice mail, would like to see if you could extend another 20k loan for this year.\", evan.halper@latimes.com, Twitter: @evanhalper]", "Date": "20140803", "Title": "[Sordid public corruption trial for Virginia ex-Gov.

{"Content": "[[, Its been nearly three years since Rick Perry stood on a debate stage in Michigan and fumbled fruitlessly for the name of the third federal agency he vowed to eliminate as president., Since then, the Texas governor has worked assiduously to restore his once-platinum political reputation  the Republican had never lost an election before his failed White House bid  and to position himself for another try in 2016., There were issue tutorials and appearances on national talk shows, travels to burnish his foreign policy credentials and visits to key political states, in particular the money-lode of California and early-voting Iowa., All that threatened to come undone with Perrys startling indictment Friday on charges that he abused his office by eliminating funds for the states ethics watchdog, an office overseen by the Travis County district attorney, a Democrat and persistent irritant., In a brief yet fierce appearance Saturday before reporters in Austin, Perry denied any wrongdoing and said he was the victim of a partisan persecution  a notion that drew not just Republican support but the backing of some Democrats and legal analysts., \"I wholeheartedly and unequivocally stand behind my veto and will continue to defend this lawful action of my executive authority as governor,\" said Perry, who punctuated his vigorous defense with a frequently wagging finger and sordid details of the arrest last year of his nemesis, Dist. Atty. Rosemary Lehmberg, for drunk driving., It was Lehmbergs conduct and Perrys subsequent threat to veto funding for her office that resulted in Fridays grand jury indictment., \"I intend to fight against those who would erode our states constitution and laws purely for political purposes, and I intend to win,\" the governor said., By portraying himself as a wrongful target, Perry sought not just to deflect the damage of the indictment but to turn the episode to his political advantage, rallying Republican donors and activists aggrieved at the perception of yet another arrogant government overreach., \"We dont settle political differences with indictments in this country,\" Perry said, echoing a cry that allies took up shortly after the indictment was unsealed. \"It is outrageous that some would use partisan theatrics to rip away at the very fabric of our states constitution.\", It will take considerable time before the political effects of the indictment and Perrys aggressive defense are known; still ahead is the prospect of booking, fingerprinting and a requisite mug shot, which seems destined to appear in campaign ads by Democrat and Republican alike., Other GOP presidential hopefuls  Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Scott Walker of Wisconsin  face their own potential legal jeopardy involving accusations of government misconduct, so Perry is not alone in that regard. (Walker, unlike others eyeing a 2016 run, is also in the midst of a stiff November reelection fight.), Against that backdrop, Perrys political skills over the next days and weeks will determine whether he climbs back into the top tier of candidates, where he resided until his collapse in the 2012 campaign; remains an afterthought; or, worse, a lingering joke with the punch line, \"Oops.\", In Texas, where Perrys third and final term ends in January, the governor has been a formidable campaigner, commanding the political agenda and shining in one-on-one encounters. Lately he showed flashes of his old home-state luster, winning positive reviews from activists in Iowa and vaulting himself into the national debate over immigration with a strong stand against the rush of Central American youth to the U.S.-Mexico border., But there have been signs as well of the more cavalier Perry, who by his own admission entered the race the last time ill-prepared and insufficiently serious., In San Francisco in June, he tossed a bouquet to Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton  \"great secretary of State, first lady\"  a line unlikely to win friends in a GOP primary. After appearing this week at the Iowa State Fair, he exulted in his performance, telling the Des Moines Register, \"Im awesome!\", His indictment, of course, poses a much sterner, more consequential test., Perry was charged with two felony counts that stemmed from his threatened veto of $7.5 million in funding for the public ethics unit in Lehmbergs office, which oversees state and federal lawmakers. After her arrest, the governor had said he would zero out the money unless she quit., \"I exercised  authority to veto funding for an office whose leadership had lost the public confidence by acting inappropriately and unethically,\" Perry told reporters Saturday., Lehmberg served about half of a 45-day jail sentence but refused to resign, and Perry followed through on his veto threat, prompting a government watchdog group to file a complaint saying Perrys actions amounted to improper intimidation. A special prosecutor was appointed and several top aides to Perry appeared before the Austin grand jury for questioning. The governor did not testify., Critics of Perry note that at the time funding for Lehmbergs office was cut, its public corruption unit was investigating one of the governors pet projects, the Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of Texas. Questions have surfaced regarding the institutes funding and the role of some of Perrys political allies., The governor did not address the matter in his eight-minute appearance Saturday, but rather laced into Lehmberg for her belligerent behavior after her arrest., \"Stopped for a DWI with a blood-alcohol level almost three times the legal limit,\" Perry said. \"An individual who, when booked in, had to be restrained, was abusive to law enforcement, was kicking the door. I think Americans and Texans who have seen this agree with me, that that is not an individual who was heading up an office that we can afford to fund.\", Many of Perrys fellow Republicans  including several potential 2016 rivals  rushed to agree., Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who has not had the warmest relationship with the governor, called Perry a \"friend  a man of integrity\" and used a Twitter hashtag to say he was \"proud to #StandWithRickPerry.\", Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana posted a series of tweets defending Perry and calling the indictment \"a blatant misuse of the judicial system by liberal activists who couldnt defeat him at the polls.\" Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whose son is running for state office in Texas, called the indictment \"politically motivated and ridiculous.\", Far more surprising was the support of many Democrats, who also questioned the case against Perry. Among them was David Axelrod, a longtime Democratic strategist and advisor to President Obama., \"Unless he was demonstrably trying to scrap the ethics unit for other than his stated reason,\" Axelrod stated on Twitter, \"Perry indictment seems pretty sketchy.\", mark.barabak@latimes.com, Twitter: @markzbarabak]", "Date": "20140816", "Title": "[Texas Gov.

Scott Walker reiterated that he would tear up the nuclear deal with Iran on his first day in the Oval Office  but thats just the beginning!, To me, Walker said,you terminate the deal on day one, you reinstate the sanctions authorized by Congress, you go to Congress and put in place even more crippling sanctions in place, and then you convince our allies to do the same., At the late-afternoonkids tabledebate,Carly Fiorinasaid: On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls.

(She had better hope that the supreme leaders voice mail has a long running time.), In the same encounter, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, dating himself, said: Itll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one. Were going to start the process of securing that border. Im also going to take a bottle ofWite-Outwith me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to., Ted Cruz also plans a busy first day:, The first thing I intend to do is to rescind every illegal and unconstitutional executive action taken by Barack Obama.

The next thing I intend to do is instruct the Department of Justice and the IRS to start persecutingpresumably he meant protectingreligious liberty, and then intend to cancel the Iran deal, and finally move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem., Then ... lunch., Some of these first-day actions are perfectly feasible, such as the revocation or Wite-Outing of executive orders. But others promise more than they deliver, such as Cruzs suggestion that he could quickly sic the Justice Department on Planned Parenthood., The larger objection to day one promises is that they reflect a lack of humility. In some cases, it will be obvious that a new president will want to countermand the actions of a predecessor and no further research or consultation will be required. But in other areasespecially in foreign policyit would be rash to rush to action without sounding out allies and considering the consequences., Jeb Bush, to his credit, recognized this. He was widely criticized a few weeks ago when hesaid: One thing that I wont do is just say, as a candidate, Im going to tear up the agreement on the first day. Thats great. That sounds great, but maybe you ought to check in with your allies first. Maybe you ought to appoint a secretary of state, maybe secretary of defense. You might want to have your team in place before you take an act like that., Even when a president can act on day oneor day two or day threeinking an executive order doesnt mean that change will actually occur.

Time to start circulating those petitions in front of grocery stores in the hopes of passing new laws or taxes (or tax cuts) or rights or special carve-outs for your company in the November 2016 election., And guess what? Its going to be easier than ever, thanks to perennially plunging voter-turnout numbers in the state. Thats because the number of signatures required to turn an idea into a ballot proposition is based on the number of votes cast in the previous gubernatorial election. Since Novembers governors race had the lowest voter turnout in more than 100 years  well, you do the math., Its a cruel twist that the fewer people who vote, the longer and more complicated the ballots may become., For the last election, it took 504,760 signatures from registered California voters to qualify a citizen initiative for the ballot and 807,615 to qualify a constitutional amendment. This time around, it will take just 365,880 signatures for an initiative and 585,407 for a constitutional amendment., That may sound like a lot of John Hancocks, especially to the people standing in 90-degree heat outside Trader Joes with a clipboard. But it is an extremely small slice of the states 39.5 million residents., To the special interests that pay signature gatherers to do the work, it will mean giant savings  money that can be spent instead on more of those irritating slick, color mailers and ubiquitous radio ads that inundate (and often mislead) voters in the days before an election., If thats not enough to keep you up at night contemplating initiative reform, heres another sobering thought: With 20 months to go before the next general election, there are already three qualified ballot measures, including a referendum on the states single-use plastic bag ban, and 13 citizen initiatives  some silly, some serious, some insane  pending but not yet qualified., One would start the process for California to secede from the United States. Another states mysteriously that \"Innocent human life is inviolable. It cannot be terminated, defiled, or destroyed with impunity under any circumstances.\" One particularly horrible (though unlikely to succeed) proposal is the \"Sodomite Suppression Act,\" which would criminalize sodomy and require that gay people be put to death. And there will be more., Californias initiative system was designed more than 100 years ago to wrest control of the state out of the hands of the railroad barons. But today, it is too often a force for self-interest rather than public interest. Any industry  even a single company or billionaire with the desire and financial means  can bypass legislators with a self-serving proposal., Like democracy itself, the states initiative process is the worst form of lawmaking, except for all the others., Thanks tolegislation pushed through by former Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, the process should be slightly improved in the coming election cycle. Among other things, public hearings on proposed initiatives will be held earlier, after just a quarter of the signatures have been gathered. A commenting period has been added early in the process, so that anyone can lodge opinions about the proposal  and proponents will then have an opportunity to amend their proposals. As of last Monday, more than 130 comments had been received for initiatives that are either pending or have been cleared for signature gathering. Major donors will be named and fiscal effects will be clearly outlined online., These changes wont necessarily block all bad ideas from getting onto the ballot. There is, however, one simple thing that Californians can do to push back against initiative mischief without rewriting the state Constitution. Before signing any petition, for heavens sake, read it carefully. Dont rely on the word of paid signature gatherers, who are paid per signature and are notorious for saying anything to get people to sign. Pull out your smartphone and check it out yourself on the secretary of states website: www.sos.ca.gov., Blindly signing petitions could result in a harsh awakening one November morning to discover that a narrow margin of Californias voters had just decided to secede from the United States., Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion and Facebook]", "Date": "20150323", "Title": "[Take the initiative to read the petitions before you sign]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-initiatives-20150323-story.html", "Author": "[The Times Editorial Board]"}

(People are more likely to vote for someone who uses pot, has had an extramarital affair, never held office or is gay.), The U.S. Supreme Court has brought new meaning to the phrase tear down that wall as its conservative majority has hammered away at the barrier between church and state. Government bodies are now free, thanks to one recent decision, to impose Christian prayer on everyone at the start of public meetings. Next month, in Sebelius vs. Hobby Lobby, the court will decide whether its permissible for private, nonprofit employers to impose their religious beliefs on their employees., So when I turned on my TV the other day to catch up with The Daily Show, I was surprised to see a full-throated celebrity endorsement for atheism., Hi Im Ron Reagan, an unabashed atheist, said the 56-year-old son of our 40thpresident. And Im alarmed by the intrusions of religion into our secular government. Thats why I am asking you to support the Freedom From Religion Foundation, the nations largest and most effective association of atheists and agnostics working to keep state and church separate, just like our founding fathers intended., His sign off: Lifelong atheist, not afraid of burning in hell., People dont usually spout off about their atheism, so I was curious what led him to make the spot. Thursday, I reached Reagan, an MSNBC contributor, in Seattle, where he has lived after leaving Los Angeles in 1994., He sounded subdued, and said he has not been working much, having just suffered through a personal tragedy. On March 24, he said, his wife of 33 years, Doria Palmieri Reagan, died of complications from a progressive neuromuscular disease that she developed seven-and-a-half years ago. A clinical psychologist, Doria Reagan was seven years older than her husband., But he had made a promise to the Freedom From Religion Foundation, which honored him in 2009, and he felt obligated to keep it. Reagan has been a nonbeliever since childhood, he said, and is surprised when people react with incredulity when they hear it., I think when you hold an opinion that you find entirely reasonable, you are surprised when you discover that other people dont also consider it reasonable, and kind of get up in arms, he said., Thats a familiar reaction to people who are outspoken about their atheism or agnosticism, said Annie Laurie Gaylor, co-president of the Wisconsin-based foundation, which considers its mission education., We get emails every day telling us we should leave the country. Very nasty stuff. Death threats,\" Gaylor said. \"The crank mail and phone campaigns are unending and almost always in response to our work for separation of church and state--not for promoting free thought and atheism. But theres no question that atheists and agnostics are at the bottom of the totem pole when it comes to social acceptance., Indeed. In 2006, a University of Minnesota study published in the American Sociological Review, found that atheists are less likely to be accepted, publicly and privately, than any others from a long list of ethnic, religious and other minority groups. Atheists topped a list called I Would Disapprove if My Child Wanted to Marry a Member of This Group., Gaylor said her foundation has been inspired to raise its profile by the recent successes of the gay civil rights movement. We already have an out of the closet movement, but we need to turn up the volume. (The foundation also filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the Hobby Lobby case.), Comedian Julia Sweeney cut a spot for the organization two years ago, taking on the American Conference of Catholic Bishops campaign against Obamacares contraception mandate. The ad aired 1,100 times, Gaylor said., Getting a celebrity with Reagans name recognition was a coup, Gaylor said. His spot ran May 22 on two Comedy Central shows, The Daily Show and The Colbert Report. The organization paid $155,000 for air time. She hopes to raise enough money to place the ad on 60 Minutes in the fall., Reagans spot has generated hundreds of responses. Some are very poignantI never thought I would live to see a commercial like this. Theres a lot of gratitude pouring in for Ron Reagan. Hes a big name, and thats what our movement has lacked., Reagan, who, like his mother former First Lady Nancy Reagan, has advocated for stem cell research, said he worries that religion often goes hand in hand with ignorance and scientific illiteracy., I think what troubles me  whether its religiously inspired or not  is the ignorance, foolishness, and I might say, stupidity, in this country. This championing of anti-intellectual, anti-science, scientifically illiterate theories and lack of critical thinking is disturbing. Climate change is such a handy example., Religion, he said, is delusion., And when it morphs into believing that the Earth is 6,000 years old and insisting on teaching that to our children, thats a very dangerous thing., So, hey, any freethinking celebrities out there who want to lend the cause a hand: the Freedom From Religion Foundation wants a word with you., \"If you know George Clooney,\" said Gaylor, \"let me know.\", ]", "Date": "20140530", "Title": "[Ron Reagan, not afraid to burn in hell, promotes atheism in TV spot]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/abcarian/la-me-ra-ron-reagan-endorses-atheism-20140530-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, Jeb Bush carefully attempted to open up distance between himself and his brother, President George W. Bush, in a much-anticipated foreign policy speech Wednesday, suggesting that in the Mideast, he would value stability even if that meant supporting autocrats rather than democratic forces., In a speech to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Bush  widely viewed as the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination even though he has yet to formally announce his candidacy  also strongly defended the National Security Agencys collection of records on Americans telephone calls, saying it was hugely important to protect the country against terrorism., For the life of me, I dont understand why the debate has gotten off track about the program, he said., The defense of the NSA, and repeated references to the importance of engagement  a word he used in some form 22 times in a little more than an hour  drew a sharp line between the former Florida governor and potential rivals for the GOP nomination, particularly Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has denounced the NSA program and argued for reducing U.S. entanglements overseas., But it was the distinctions Bush drew with his brother that did the most to start defining what a Jeb Bush foreign policy might look like., Employing a line that his aides had widely advertised in advance, Bush said that while he admired his brother and their father, President George H.W. Bush, Im my own man, and my views are shaped by my own thinking and my own experiences., New circumstances require new approaches, he said., In the speech, he shed little light on what those new approaches might mean. Indeed, he completely avoided the most fraught part of his brothers legacy, barely mentioning the word Iraq, except in an initial stumble in which he meant to say Iran., In the question-and-answer session that followed, however, Bush broached the subject., He defended his brothers record on Iraq, saying that there were mistakes made in Iraq, for sure, but that the troop surge in the final two years of the Bush presidency was one of the most heroic acts of courage politically that  that any presidents done, because there was no support for it, and it was hugely successful., But he also drew a sharp distinction on the issue of promoting democracy overseas, which George W. Bush made a major theme of his presidency. Asked by the events moderator, former ambassador Ivo Daalder, about how to balance support for democracy with stability in the Middle East, Bush made clear that he favored the latter., Foreign policy is not about just one thing, he said. I do believe that American values and American liberty is a force for good in the world; that if we could create the freest world, that we would have less threats, less violence, less terrorism and many other things. But to get there, thats a long-term challenge., In the shorter term, we have to be practical, he said, delivering a strong defense of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Sisi, whose government has been sharply criticized by human rights groups for crushing free speech and dissent., We have to balance our belief in liberty with a belief that security and engagement will eventually yield better societies, he said., U.S. officials have put too much emphasis on holding elections as a touchstone for which governments to support, he said, adding, Ive been critical of the president a lot here. This is a problem of presidents past as well., The remarks suggested that his foreign policy would more closely resemble that of his father, who put a high premium on stability and prudence, rather than that of his brother., As expected, Bush sharply criticized President Obama as having weak leadership and misplaced priorities, sounding a theme that Republicans hope to use in the campaign against the expected Democratic nominee, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is Obamas former secretary of State., Under this administration, we are inconsistent and indecisive, he said. We have lost the trust and confidence of our friends. We definitely no longer inspire fear in our enemies., This administration talks, but the words fade, he added. They draw red lines, and then erase them. With grandiosity they announce re-sets, and then disengage. Hashtag campaigns replace actual diplomacy and engagement., Obamas failure to keep some U.S. troops in Iraq early in his first term created a void that set the stage for Islamic State militants to become a serious threat, Bush said., Although Bush criticized Obamas approach to Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, he said little about what he would do differently., He drew a sharp contrast, however, with the administrations criticism of Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying he supported Netanyahus plan to speak to Congress early next month about the negotiations over Irans nuclear program., I am surprised that the administration is upset to hear from a close and valuable ally on such a sensitive topic, Bush said., As Bush prepares for a likely presidential bid, dealing with foreign policy has loomed as a tricky topic, in part because Republican divides on foreign affairs have turned into a wide chasm in the years since his brother left the Oval Office., On one side, much of the Republican establishment favors a more activist, military-oriented policy than the Obama administration has pursued in trouble spots from Ukraine to the Middle East to East Asia., On the other side, libertarians, led by Paul, have called for reducing U.S. involvement overseas. The senator has tried to distance himself from the more isolationist extremes advocated by his father, former Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas). But he has frequently tangled with Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Marco Rubio of Florida and other Republicans who advocate what he sees as excessive U.S. involvement in overseas crises., The rapid rise of Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria appears to have strengthened the establishment position within the party. Republican voters, who had been warming to Pauls side of the debate, swung last year toward a more hawkish view of the world., david.lauter@latimes.com, Lauter reported from Washington and Bergen from Chicago., , 6:07 p.m.:This post has been revised throughout for updates and additional details., 12:20 p.m.: This post was updated throughout, This post was originally published at 9:36 a.m.]", "Date": "20150218", "Title": "[Jeb Bush casts his foreign policy views as distinct from his brother's ]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-jeb-bush-foreign-policy-20150218-story.html", "Author": "[David Lauter, Kathy Bergen]"}
{"Content": "[[, Jeb Bush may be the establishment favorite for the Republican presidential nomination, but he still has a lot of work to do to persuade GOP voters to back him, a new poll finds., By contrast, Democrats seem overwhelmingly willing to support Hillary Rodham Clinton as their partys nominee, despite unhappiness on the part of some liberal activists and the current controversy over her use of a personal email account while she was secretary of State., The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, released Monday, found that 49% of likely Republican primary voters said they could see supporting Bush, the former governor of Florida, while 42% said they could not., Two of Bushs rivals, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, were more widely acceptable. Just over half (53%) of people who expect to vote in the GOP primaries said they could see backing Walker, compared with only 17% who said they could not. Rubio drew a similarly one-sided response, 56% to 26%., By contrast, the poll delivered harsh news to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie: 57% of the likely GOP voters said they could not see supporting him, compared with 32% who said they could., Of 14 GOP figures polled, the only one who did worse than Christie was Donald Trump, the developer and casino owner, whose occasional declarations that he plans to run are usually dismissed as self-promotional stunts., Among other major GOP figures, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul had ratings similar to Bushs., On the Democratic side, 86% of likely primary voters said they could see supporting Clinton. The poll was conducted Sunday to Thursday of last week, as the controversy over her email use began to bubble., Voters overall had a positive image of Clinton, with 44% viewing her favorably and 36% negatively. Bush is less well known, with 23% seeing him positively and 34% negatively., The poll does point to one significant area of potential weakness for Clinton: By 51% to 44%, voters overall said she would represent \"a return to policies of the past\" rather than \"new ideas and vision for the future.\", That could be a liability at a time when 59% of voters say they would prefer to see a candidate \"who will bring greater changes\" than one who is \"more experienced and tested.\", But Clintons liability on that question is notably less than Bushs. In his case, 60% see him as representing the past, and 27% say he would represent the future., The poll, conducted by a team of pollsters from each party, Bill McInturff from the GOP and Fred Yang from the Democrats, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points for the full sample., For more on politics and policy, follow@DavidLauter on Twitter.]", "Date": "20150309", "Title": "[2016 Republican race up for grabs, Democrats back Clinton, poll finds]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-nbc-wsj-poll-2016-clinton-20150309-story.html", "Author": "[David Lauter]"}
{"Content": "[[, Joe Biden was not the only one who found himself in crisis when a videotape emerged during the 1988 presidential primary exposing him as a plagiarist., The political operatives who had secretly distributed footage of Sen. Biden passing off the words of a British politician as his own also had a big problem on their hands., Their disclosure nearly derailed the candidacy of the rival the operatives worked for, Michael S. Dukakis. He fired them and issued a major mea culpa., Dont expect any such apologies in this years presidential race., Political opposition research, once a mostly unmentioned dark art, has turned into a garish, multimillion-dollar enterprise complete with logos, marketing strategies and indiscriminate, real-time streaming of the work product onto social media., Changes in the way voters consume information, a numbness to the negative politicking that once so offended them and the emergence of new research and data distribution technologies are driving once-shadowy operatives into the sunlight. The prominence of super PACs and campaign-oriented nonprofits also plays a role., The research machines have emerged from the back office of party headquarters and into the high-stakes world of political fundraising., Our focus is driving negative news narratives against [Hillary Rodham] Clinton, said Colin Reed, executive director of America Rising PAC, a formidable Republican operation with scores of staffers scouring campaign events, public filings, social media and any other resource they can find for nuggets that might harm the Democratic candidate., This self-styled new generation of Republican research and rapid response is split into two organizations. The PAC distributes material generated by a much bigger private company staffed with researchers. The higher the profile the PAC creates, the more clients the business side reels in., Things once considered taboo just arent taboo anymore, said Alan Huffman, an opposition researcher who co-wrote a book about the craft, Were with Nobody., He attributes the ability of groups like America Rising to distribute attack after attack with little risk of voter backlash to the Monica Lewinsky scandal, when so many tawdry details were unearthed that the public became jaded to the airing of a politicians dirty laundry., Others point to the modern news cycle, which is filled with outlets  many of them partisan  constantly trolling for content. Operatives who once valued discretion above all else now focus on mass disbursement, as items placed with even the most fringe websites can gain traction and dominate a news cycle., Never before have there been so many hit jobs peddled to the media, to gadflies, to swing voters  to anyone who might notice  so openly and swiftly., Its reached the point where you have trackers tracking other trackers, said GOP strategist Kevin Madden, referring to low-level operatives who follow candidates around and record their every public utterance. This used to be guerrilla warfare. Now it is out in the open., Just how little discretion there is anymore was clear this month in New Hampshire during a bizarre encounter in which a Rand Paul staffer expressed his irritation with a Democratic tracker by licking his camera. The video went viral on Twitter., Back at America Rising, Reed proudly ticks off the damage his group has inflicted on a range of candidates. He guides a reporter through the process of finding and then leaking an embarrassing internal memo from the campaign of Michelle Nunn, a Democrat from Georgia who lost her bid for Senate last year. It mostly involved clever use of Google., The method was not that different in 2006 when Democratic operatives stumbled on an embarrassing audiotape of California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger  only then, nobody was rushing to take credit for finding the material., The governor launched a state police investigation to find out who slipped the audio to the Los Angeles Times. No wrongdoing was discovered, just some poor file management by the Schwarzenegger administration., The veil over such research tactics lifted in 2011, when Democrats created a group called American Bridge., The founders of American Bridge, the first super PAC devoted exclusively to researching damaging information on GOP candidates, leveraged big donations from labor unions and donors such as George Soros to fund an army of campaign trackers and data miners., The outfit repeatedly frazzled the campaign of GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, taking aim at his voluminous tax returns and his comments to donors that 47% of the electorate are dependent on government and believe that they are victims., It was American Bridge that doomed the Senate candidacy that year of Missouri Republican Todd Akin, seizing on his comments about what constitutes legitimate rape to dash GOP hopes in what was supposed to be a winnable race., Now, American Bridges leaders have formed another super PAC, called Correct the Record, that will push the boundaries of campaign finance law by directly coordinating its research efforts with Clintons presidential campaign., The burgeoning oppo industry is an example oft-cited by those who warn big money is corroding democracy., They are raising these pools of unlimited money, and none of it is going toward elevating the political debate, said Robert Maguire, an investigator with the Center for Responsive Politics. The aim of these groups is to embarrass the candidates they dont like, whether it is by publishing books full of opposition research or this creepy tracker element., Maguire finds it particularly distasteful that an organization like American Bridge has been granted tax-exempt status by the IRS, a designation set aside for charities  and specifically not allowed for political campaigns. The goal of American Bridge is, We want Democrats to win, so here is all the slime we can heap on Republican candidates, he said., Brad Woodhouse, a former president of American Bridge who now runs Correct the Record, takes exception., If you are getting more info out there about candidates that fills in their biography, fills in their thinking, fills in their policy proposals, their philosophy or their inconsistencies, or their pandering or whatever it is, it has to be better than not having that information out there, he said., Woodhouse points to the Akin example. But for every example like that, dozens more are far less heady., American Bridge has equipped its trackers with technology to live-stream events, enabling headquarters to blast gaffes in the field onto social media before an event even ends. It boasts of a recent success involving a Jeb Bush misstep getting posted online in less than 20 minutes.

{"Content": "[[, Joints, pot brownies, cannabisdosed sodas and other marijuana products will soon be sold in retail shops to any adult who wants them throughout a large chunk of the West, after voters in Oregon and Alaska approved legalization measures Tuesday., And an initiative approved overwhelmingly by Washington, D.C., voters legalizes the use and cultivation of marijuana there, but stops short of allowing retail sales., The states join Colorado and Washington, which legalized recreational pot sales only two years ago, in a remarkable change of fortune for legalization advocates who had been toiling for decades to lift the prohibition on the drug. Proponents this week overcame voter concerns surrounding the bumpy roll out of the taxing and regulatory plans for cannabis in the states where it was legalized in 2012  as well as many unwelcome headlines  in a sign that voter unease with the drug is rapidly fading., The outcome also was a clear sign that opinions on marijuana no longer fall neatly along partisan lines. The narrow passage of legalization in GOP-dominated Alaska, where 52% of voters cast ballots in favor, was considered a symbolic victory among cannabis advocates., The vote in the capital also had political significance, playing out in the backyard of federal government as advocates try to persuade Congress to soften drug laws. The Washington, D.C., measure was driven in large part by racial justice concerns, in a city where African Americans accounted for 91% of those arrested for drug possession, even though statistics show they are no more likely to use the drug than whites., Organizers are now setting their sights on California for 2016, where they are confident the states liberal-leaning electorate will opt to legalize sales for recreational use. Such an outcome would create a bulwark for marijuana permissiveness in the West, which proponents hope to bolster by targeting large states to the east for legalization measures in 2016 and shortly thereafter., This Election Day was an extraordinary one for the marijuana and criminal justice reform movements, Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, said in a statement. The alliance, a nonprofit bankrolled by billionaire George Soros, invested heavily in the Oregon measure through its political action affiliate, and it also provided advice and financial support to the Alaska initiative., These victories are even more notable for having happened in a year when Democrats were trounced at the polls, Nadelmann wrote. Reform of marijuana and criminal justice policies is no longer just a liberal cause but a conservative and bipartisan one as well. On these issues at least, the nation is at last coming to its senses., This election season was also notable for the opposition the marijuana movement attracted. Billionaire casino magnate Sheldon Adelson stepped up with $5 million to help defeat a fairly routine measure in Florida to legalize marijuana for medical use only. But the measure, which had a majority of support from voters, would have passed in most other states. It was done in by a Florida state law that requires 60% approval for constitutional measures to pass. It fell just a few percentage points short., Still, Adelsons involvement in the campaign marked the first time a mega-donor has gotten so deeply involved in fighting such a measure. Opponents of pot said they had never before been able to afford television time, and in Florida they had the resources to mount a sophisticated multimedia effort. Adelsons political advisor said the billionaire will be looking for other opportunities to fight legalization., Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a national anti-pot group, is vowing to step up its efforts., This was not the complete slam-dunk the legalization groups expected, said a statement from Kevin Sabet, president of the group. Alaska barely voted to legalize, and several cities rejected marijuana retail stores outright. We are confident the more people know the truth about marijuana and the Big Tobacco-like marijuana industry, the more opposition to marijuana legalization will continue to grow., For more on the politics of marijuana, follow me on Twtitter: @evanhalper]", "Date": "20141105", "Title": "[Pot legalization spreads through the West and into D.C.]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-pn-pot-legalization-20141105-story.html", "Author": "[Evan Halper]"}
{"Content": "[[, Just prior to announcing his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination, Mike Huckabee addressed the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition in Waukee. We are criminalizing Christianity in this country, Huckabee declared. We cannot stand by silently. The Southern Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and Fox News host went on to sympathize with those who are scorned or mocked for what they believe and suggested that they might be jailed. Thats the fear that we better face, he concluded., Most voters outside of Republican primaries will find these assertions less than persuasive, even paranoid, but also, perhaps, familiar. With his entry into the race, Huckabee is bringing back into the national political conversation the sounds and tropes of the religious right. Whereas the tea party, which has come to dominate the grass-roots movement, broadcasts anger, the religious right stresses victimization., Huckabees statement in Waukee was eerily reminiscent of the sentiments I encountered among activists on the religious right in the run-up to the Iowa caucuses in 1988. At that time, Iowas evangelicals were still relatively new to the political process, still learning the ropes. But they were already fluent in the language of ill-treatment., The enemy would just come in like a flood if we didnt stand there, one activist told me., For much of the 20th century, Americas evangelicals felt marginalized. They hunkered into a subculture of their own making  congregations, denominations, Bible camps, Bible institutes, private colleges, seminaries  to protect themselves from the depredations of an outside world that they believed was both corrupt and corrupting., When they emerged into the political arena in the late 1970s, enraged by the rescission of tax-exempt status for segregated schools and later galvanized by opposition to abortion, they came to believe that their values were under attack. Despite their numbers and their growing political influence, they still felt, in Huckabees words, scorned and mocked., By the 1980s, abortion was the issue that politically conservative evangelicals talked about most  and they did so in terms that suggested an almost preternatural identification with the innocence and the vulnerability of the fetus., The most dangerous place to be these days, the president of the Iowa chapter of Concerned Women for America told me in 1988, is inside a mothers womb., An antiabortion radio commercial airing around that time began: First we had abortion, and they said that was all they wanted. The ominous voice continued: Then we had infanticide, killing handicapped newborn babies. Now we have euthanasia, killing the elderly and sick. Then, after a pause: Will you be their next victim?, They and their were never specified, and the radio spot offered no evidence of infanticide or euthanasia. But the rhetoric of vulnerability need not be accurate to be effective., Huckabee is deploying the same sort of rhetoric now as he advances his presidential prospects and tries to mobilize conservative evangelicals., Whereas a candidate such as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky worries about personal liberties, Huckabee warns about religious persecution. I came to New Hampshire to announce that I will fight for your right to be left alone, Paul declared at the beginning of his campaign., Huckabees approach is less philosophical and more visceral. I think its fair to say that Christian convictions are under attack as never before, not just in our lifetime, but never before in the history of this great republic, Huckabee told pastors on an April conference call arranged by the Family Research Council., Of course, Huckabees linguistic style is part and parcel of his political strategy. In his 2008 book, Do the Right Thing, Huckabee noted that whenever the religious right was energized and turned loose, they made the difference in elections. Conversely, when the GOP somewhat put us back in the attic and out of the way, we lost., Huckabees argument to Republican primary voters is that the religious right, beginning with Ronald Reagan and continuing with George W. Bush, has a better track record of electing presidents than the tea party. When politically conservative evangelical voters have been indifferent about the Republican nominee  George H. W. Bushs run for reelection in 1992, John McCain in 2008, Mitt Romney in 2012  the partys fortunes have faltered., At yet another event in Iowa last year, Huckabee took aim at those within his party who want to avoid social issues. They only want to talk about liberty and low taxes, he complained., The anger of tea party activists, in Huckabees assessment, might attract media attention, but blind fury tends to be more evanescent than moral passion or the conviction that your values are endangered., This is the sentiment that lies behind the so-called religious-freedom laws making their way through Republican-dominated state legislatures  laws that would allow individuals and businesses to refuse service on the basis of religious convictions. Our values are under attack, they insist. Huckabee warns darkly of incarceration., Huckabees own path from the attic back into the mainstream of presidential politics will not be easy. Resuscitating the rhetoric of victimization that religious right voters found so compelling in the 1980s, he must persuade them that their way of life is under siege. His electoral prospects may ride on his success in doing so., Randall Balmer, an Episcopal priest, is chairman of the Religion Department at Dartmouth College.

{"Content": "[[, Kamala Harris has spent months on what looked like a glide path into the U.S. Senate, but the emergence of Loretta Sanchez as her chief rival puts Californias attorney general in a tough fight against a member of Congress with a history of defying low expectations., The contest between two liberal Democrats could split California along regional and ethnic lines. Harris, a former San Francisco district attorney, expects to dominate in the Bay Area while Sanchez, an Orange County native, would draw strength mainly from Southern California., Harris, whose ancestry is black and Indian, is widely seen as the favorite after four months of building political support and raising money, much of it from Hollywood. She coasted to reelection as attorney general in November., Sen.

Barbara Boxers announcement that she will not seek reelection put an end to years of frustration on the part of a younger generation of California politicians who can now start elbowing their way upward in the states first wide-open U.S. Senate race since 1992., Californias strongly Democratic..., Sanchez is counting on the same force that vaulted her into the House more than 18 years ago to thrust her into the Senate next year: Latino voters growing clout in California, particularly in presidential election years., I would be the first Latina ever elected to the United States Senate, Sanchez said Thursday in announcing her candidacy outside the ornate Spanish Colonial train station in Santa Ana, her predominantly Latino hometown., A daughter of Mexican immigrants, Sanchez burst into national politics by ousting Republican firebrand Bob Dornan from Congress in 1996. It was a stunning setback for Republicans in the partys Orange County stronghold., It was also a pivotal moment in California politics, heralding Republicans nearly two-decade fall from power in a state where the partys hard line on immigration touched off a fierce Latino backlash., The race to succeed Democratic incumbent Barbara Boxer, who is not seeking reelection, will be the first statewide contest for Sanchez, a member of the House Armed Services and Homeland Security committees., In Santa Ana, where she was surrounded by friends and family, Sanchez played up her House experience on foreign policy, saying she had visited Iraq, Afghanistan and other war zones countless times., Im running for the Senate because I believe in fighting for whats right, and for whats in your heart, and thats why I voted against the Iraq war when everyone was beating the war drums, she said., Harris lack of experience in national and foreign policy, Sanchez said, will be a key point of contrast., Harris spokesman Nathan Click said, The attorney general looks forward to a lively discussion about who is best equipped to help change the culture of dysfunction in Washington, D.C., and make a difference in the lives of Californians., Sanchez, 55, grew up in Anaheim and graduated in 1982 from what is now Chapman University in Orange. She has an MBA in finance from American University in Washington, D.C. For nine years, she worked as a financial analyst for private companies and public agencies., A younger sister, Linda Snchez of Whittier, is also a Democratic member of Congress., A question facing Sanchez now is whether the kind of attention she has won while in Congress could weigh down her campaign. On occasion, she has made fellow Democrats wince., In 2000, she embarrassed party presidential nominee Al Gore by scheduling a fundraiser at the Playboy Mansion during the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. At Gores behest, the party took away Sanchezs convention speaking slot. Sanchez backed down and moved the event to Universal Studios CityWalk., Sanchez has also made headlines with cheeky Christmas cards. For years, they featured Gretzky, her white cat. One card showed Sanchez, wearing pink flannel pajamas, snuggling in bed with Gretzky. Another showed the congresswoman in a tank top on a motorcycle, with Gretzky perched on the handlebars., Sanchezs public image has left some party strategists skeptical of her prospects., Theres a genuine hunger for a history-making Latino candidate in this race, but Loretta Sanchez is probably not the answer to that hunger, said Democratic strategist Roy Behr, a former campaign advisor to Boxer. One could call her actions eccentric, or courageously charting her own path, or bad political judgment. But theyre not actions that enhance someones ability to run a credible Senate campaign., But Fernando Guerra, a political science professor at Loyola Marymount University, suggested that Sanchez fit Californias tradition of defying political conventions. He recalled the U.S. Senate victories of semanticist S.I. Hayakawa in 1976 and of Hollywood dancer and actor George Murphy in 1964., You need to capture the publics imagination, and I think her eccentricities will really help her, said Guerra, who nonetheless called Harris the favorite., Antonio Gonzalez, president of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project, said Sanchez could inspire a surge in Latino voter turnout. She has long prepared for this race in both political and policy terms, he said., In Santa Ana, Sanchez said she did not believe she had a public-image problem. Im really a policy wonk at heart, she said., Sanchez cannot seek reelection to the House while running for Senate, so her departure sets off a scramble for her seat. The areas large Vietnamese community could be a key asset for Republicans as they try to recapture it., In the Senate race, Sanchez will need to raise money aggressively. At the end of March, she had less than $540,000 on hand, while Harris had more than $2.2 million, according to their most recent finance reports., Sanchez said she was not worried about money. Just think, she said. If every Latino in this state would send $1 today to our campaign, wed have more resources than we would need., Two other Latino Democrats are considering the race: Rep.

Since then, he has allowed his readers to traversethe healthcare landscapewith him via regular updates., This week heconnected the dots between his medical condition and the Republican Partys oft-expressed determination to repeal the AffordableCare Act., Drum wrote that, because of his condition, Republican healthcare policy sharply raises the stakesof the 2016 election for people in his position. By undoing the Affordable Care Act, he observed, a Republican Congress and Republican president could leave millions of Americans without access to affordable coverage:, \"This is more personal for me than usual. Scary, too. There are no guarantees in life, and theres no guarantee that MoJo will employ me forever. If I lose my job, and Republicans repeal Obamacare, I will be left with a very serious and very expensive medical condition and no insurance to pay for it. And I feel quite certain that Republicans will do nothing to help me out.\", Thats all true. Among the most important provisions of the ACA isa prohibition against refusing insurance to individuals with preexisting medical conditions, or even pricing it higher for them than for healthy individuals. This eliminates the risk that people could become uninsurable if they fallsick -- a verycommon riskin the pre-Obamacare days., As we reported a couple of weeks ago, the Congressional GOP does not have a coherent plan for healthcare reform ifthey repeal Obamacare. That was made even clearer this week when they released their proposed budget resolutionfor the coming year. The budget plan includes repealingObamacare. But it presents not a whit of rationale for doing so, while utterly ignoring the mounting pile of documentation that the Affordable Care Act works extremelywell., \"Repeal Obamacare\" is a Republican shibboleth, a litmus test for showing your right-wing credentials. Its not a healthcare reform policy but a nihilistic absence of one. As Richard Mayhew, the health insurance blogger at Balloon-Juice.com (like me one of Kevins fans), wrote succinctly of the stakes: \"Cancer can hit anyone, and under the Republican plan, a one time cancer diagnosis and recovery screws a person for life. Under the Democratic current law and future policy plans, that person is not screwed for life.\", You should send Kevin your best wishes, whether via his blogs comment thread, tweeting @kdrum, or ESP.

{"Content": "[[, Kim Davis, the devout Christian who is fighting against issuing Kentucky marriage licenses to same-sex couples, is hardly the first to be caught in the battle between religious beliefsand civil laws. Modern social issues, including abortion rights and capital punishment, have hinged on the same fulcrum., The issue is centuries old. The Bible notes that Jesus, attempting to avoid being trapped in a treasonous statement, tried to separate church and state and explained: Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesars; and unto God the things that are Gods., On Wednesday, Davis was again confronted with a request by a same-sex couple for a license to marry, and for the second day, she refused to grant the needed papers. The Rowan County clerk has maintained that her religious beliefs and Gods authority are superior to U.S. courts that have held there is a constitutional right for members of the same sexto marry., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, Davis and six of her deputies have been ordered to appear before a federal judge Thursday to explain why they should not be held in contempt for failing to issue the licenses., After the Supreme Court in June ruled that same-sex marriage is a constitutional right, clerks in several Southern states refused to issue marriage licenses, citing a personal religious objection. In an attemptto avoid discrimination, the clerks,like Davis, refused to give a marriage license to any couple  homosexual or heterosexual., Two cases are technically still pending in Texas, though the clerks offices have been issuing licenses, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, which has brought such litigation. There also are a handful of Alabama counties where clerks have refused to issue licenses, and those cases are pending in the lower courts there., But the Kentucky case has drawn the most attention because it is the first to make it to the Supreme Court, said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond School of Law., None have gone so far along to the Supreme Court, he said Wednesday of the Davis case. None of the clerks have been so visible, and none have had such a high profile. It is has brought all the attention to this situation., After a life that included personal problems and several marriages, Davis said she became a devout Christian four years ago after the death of her mother-in-law., I went to church to fulfill her dying wish, Davis said in a statement, released through her lawyers, Liberty Counsel, which defends Christians in cases where religion clashes with civil society. In church, I heard a message of grace and forgiveness and surrendered my life to Jesus Christ. I am not perfect. No one is. But I am forgiven., Davis, in her court papers, argued that her religious beliefs mean that she cannot in good conscience sign or allow her name to be on a license that is given to same-sex couples. She cited the Constitutions 1st Amendment and the state Religious Freedom Restoration Act, designed to protect religious expression. The state law is modeled on a federal law of the same name., Those arguments didnt sway the lower courts, nor the U.S. Supreme Court, Tobias said., The clash between the 1st and 14th amendments is the nub of the issue, he said. The courts have said that religious arguments have to give way to the due process requirements under the 14th amendment., The Supreme Court rejected Davis claims, and though there were no opinions or dissents, the top court seemed clear, Tobias said. It probably felt that it had already dealt with the merits of the issue of same-sex marriage, and now clerks have to do their duty under the constitution., According to Douglas Laycock, a law professor at the University of Virginiawho specializes in religious freedom cases, the Kentucky case seems clear given federal laws on when a person can claim a religious exemption., Her office cannot claim a religious exemption, Laycock said. The county has no religion so it is not allowed to claim an exemption. She doesnt have to do it personally, but someone in her office has to issue the license., In an email, Mathew Staver, chairman and founder of Liberty Counsel, defended Davis, whom he said is merely requesting her right of conscience be accommodated. There are a number of alternative ways to do this, including removing her name and title from the marriage license., Staver also argued that there are other places to get a marriage license nearby so Kim Davis request for accommodation is reasonable and an easy fix., What comes next will depend on the contempt hearing Thursday and whether a penalty  a fineor imprisonment  is imposed. Davis is an elected official and has refused to resign despite calls from activists who have sought a state impeachment proceeding., Meanwhile, Davis tried to spend Wednesday morning out of the limelight in her private office. She did emerge to deny a marriage license sought by Robbie Blankenship and Jesse Cruz, a couple from Ohio. Their confrontation was caught on video broadcast by local and national outlets., What authority do you have under the United States Supreme Court? Blankenship called out as Davis leaves after rejecting the license request. None, he said., You are a disgrace, he continued.

{"Content": "[[, Kristina Schake had built a solid reputation among political operatives for driving the shift in voter opinion on gay marriage, foiling Big Tobacco forces and helping Michelle Obama transcend the traditional role of first lady -- but the State Department was not her wheelhouse., So when Schake was about to interview this year for a big job on the campaign of Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former secretary of State, she needed a crash course in foreign affairs., The tutor she chose had a surprising background: a confidante of Condoleezza Rice who helped the administration of George W. Bush craft national security policy and schooled Sarah Palin in diplomacy. The two were a political mismatch. But they were aligned on more important things. They were sisters., Every time one of us has something big we are looking at, it is the other one we want to talk to, said Schakes sister, Kori., Get more national political newsand the latest from Campaign 2016 >>, The sisters from Sonoma inhabit opposite ends of the California political divide. Kori Schake operates out of Stanfords Hoover Institution, the West Coast spawning ground for conservative thought. Prominent Republicans seek her guidance on such matters as State Department management and the intricacies of NATO politics. Her younger sister by eight years, Kristina, a former LOreal executive and voracious consumer of all things pop culture, is one of the lefts most sought-after image advisors. Rob Reiner, Maria Shriver, Michelle Obama and now Clinton have all looked to Kristina Schake to build campaigns fueled by whats trending back in the real world., Californians are rightfully grumpy about how little attention presidential candidates seem to pay voters in their noncompetitive state. But the Schake sisters underscore how big California ideas and movements  on the right and the left  are guiding presidential politics., Serving as deputy communications director at the sprawling Clinton campaign, Kristina Schake has one of the most formidable tasks in Clintons Brooklyn headquarters: softening the battle-hardened candidates image and making her more relatable to the everyday Americans that Clinton talks about often. Schake has spent considerable time in Washington, but unlike so many others on that staff, she is not of Washington. She clings to her California sensibility., What I bring to it really is the ability to say, If I were in California right now, is this something I would be thinking about? Are we breaking through? Schake said., Perhaps its predictable a Democrat would use California as a guidepost. But Schakes hawkish sister -- who served as a senior campaign advisor to John McCain because, as she puts it, McCain believed in actually winning the wars we fight -- is also particularly fond of West Coast thinking., There is a much bigger-sky approach out here, Kori Schake said. In Washington, people start every policy conversation with the limitations. Here there is a vibrancy and tolerance for failure. You dont fail; you just dust yourself off and start over., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, California serendipity guided Kori Schakes career. It presented itself when she was a Stanford undergrad short on course credits for her major. The only remedy was a tedious-looking class on Soviet political elites. As happens at Stanford, it was taught by a professor able to open all manner of career doors. In this case, it was Rice., When Rice led the National Security Council, she made Schake her director of defense strategy. While Rice was secretary of State, she brought Schake in to explore how the agency could be shaken up to run more effectively. Rudy Giuliani recruited Schake as a senior advisor for his presidential bid in 2008. When his candidacy flamed out, McCain came knocking. Veterans of the campaign say Schake was a moderating counterbalance to some of the aggressive neoconservatives who dominated McCains inner circle., When Kori Schake later left Washington to take the position at Stanford, Kristina Schake gave her a copy of California, Kevin Starrs sweeping history. She wanted to make a thoughtful Californian out of me, Kori Schake said. The sisters grew up bound by few limits, with an airline pilot father who encouraged them to explore the world (they did) and a fiery community activist mother always pushing them to take a stand (they did)., Kristina Schakes imprint is evident throughout the Clinton campaign, from the campy Snapchat photos to the emphasis on the candidates experiences as a grandmother., Campaign officials are adamant that the quaint van trip across the Midwest that Clinton took when she launched her bid was all the candidates idea, but even if Schake didnt have a hand in it, the event speaks to why Clinton hired her. It is exactly the kind of thing Schake would cook up., It was under Schakes guidance that First Lady Michelle Obama cultivated an image as a pop culture icon, yet a relatable one. Schake encouraged the undercover shopping trip by Obama to Target, Obamas recruitment of Wal-Mart as a partner in a landmark nutrition crusade, and the mom dance the first lady performed with Jimmy Fallon. It was on Schakes watch that Obama presented the best picture prize at the Academy Awards., The strategists methods were shaped in some notable California battles, involving notable California personalities. Maria Shriver consulted with Schake while creating her annual womens forum, which has become a massive event attracting speakers as diverse as the Dalai Lama and Billie Jean King., She has this great sense of how someone is presenting herself, said Rob Reiner, the Hollywood director. Not just whether the person is saying the right things, but how they are coming off. He leaned heavily on Schake to pass Proposition 10, Reiners successful crusade to fund early childhood education with a tobacco tax, approved in 1998. The cigarette companies were pummeling the campaign with negative advertising. Schake confronted it by coming up with endless story angles for local newspapers and television news crews to pursue that raised suspicions about tobacco company motives., NEWSLETTER: Get essential California headlines delivered daily >>, A decade later, in 2008, Schake would find herself again plotting with Reiner and her then-business partner, Chad Griffin, on another historic California campaign. The way they went about reversing the states ban on gay marriage is the stuff of a Hollywood script  in fact, it eventually became the focus of the HBO documentary The Case Against 8., Like so many schemes of that time involving Hollywood players and money, it sprouted from a conversation at the Polo Lounge, where Reiner often held court. A Reiner acquaintance joined the conversation, urging the group to call her sisters ex-husband, who was a lawyer. It was a forgettable moment. Everyone at the table already knew lots of capable lawyers., Later, though, the woman followed up. Her sisters ex was Ted Olson, the prominent conservative who represented George W. Bush in the Supreme Court amid the contested presidential election of 2000. The darling of the right wing, it turned out, was deeply troubled by the gay marriage ban in his native state., This is the same guy who put me in bed for two days after Bush vs. Gore, said Reiner. But if it was true he was on our side, we had a chance of winning., The legendary legal bid that Olson would mount in partnership with David Boies, his Bush vs. Gore rival, was successful in persuading the courts. Schakes role was arguably tougher. She had to help persuade the public, which was key to creating an environment in which judges would be comfortable jettisoning a law approved by voters., We needed to make this issue real to people who were not gay, and get them to feel some empathy and connection to it, Schake said. The work she and Griffin did took many paths, but one of the most successful was through People magazine. It reached millions of Americans who were on the fence. Schake reads about 40 magazines a month, but she pays particular attention to People, which has huge reach among the moderate middle., She said, Think of all the other mothers who will read that magazine and see you there with kids, said Kris Perry, one of the plaintiffs profiled in the People article Schake pitched. Just that photo will change how they view the fight., Kori Schake marvels at her sisters pop culture IQ. It is not, she said, in the family DNA. Kori Schakes own fondness for periodicals tends to run toward academic journals., We compete for the aunt of the year award in the Schake tribe, she said. There is no question that while my nephews may consider me the adventurous one, she is the cool one. She sends them music that 18 months later they begin to hear played on the radio., evan.halper@latimes.com, Twitter: @evanhalper, ALSO, Are Republicans losing white voters too?, California Republicans echo U.S. trends, favoring outsiders Donald Trump and Ben Carson, Which presidential campaign is winning over Silicon Valley?

{"Content": "[[, Large numbers of Democrats key to a Hillary Rodham Clinton victory in the 2016 presidential election will take to the streets this weekend to protest a sweeping Pacific free-trade pact that has newfound momentum in Congress  but dont look for the candidate to be marching with them., Less than a week after Clinton launched her candidacy, her effort to run a campaign with populist appeal is hitting an awkward patch. The bipartisan deal on Capitol Hill that would give President Obama authority to cement a long-delayed Trans-Pacific Partnership puts the spotlight on an uncomfortable issue for the candidate., Clintons record of promoting the trade pact is a source of bitterness on the left. The congressional support for the deal is stirring up long-held resentment among labor leaders over President Clintons signing of the landmark North American Free Trade Agreement, which Hillary Clinton supported at the time., The labor unions and environmental groups opposed to the Pacific deal do not take the issue lightly. The AFL-CIO has suspended all giving to federal candidates to focus its political activity on stopping it., \"The politics around trade has always been tough, particularly in the Democratic Party, because people have memories of outsourcing and job loss,\" Obama said Friday when asked by a reporter about the deal and whether he needed Clintons support to complete it., Obama offered a lengthy and detailed response, but he did not answer the part of the question about Clinton., For her part, Clinton is treading cautiously., \"The goal is greater prosperity and security for American families, not trade for trades sake,\" said Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill. \"She will be watching closely to see what is being done to crack down on currency manipulation, improve labor rights, protect the environment and health, promote transparency and open new opportunities for our small businesses to export overseas.\", The assurances are unlikely to calm restive liberals seeking to block the legislation moving through Congress., Congress could be asked to approve a final deal just as Democratic primary voting is getting underway next year., If Clinton were to embrace the pact, it would go against the tide of Democrats aligning themselves with labor on this issue and leave potential challengers an opening for attack  but it could also give Clinton a boost., It may ultimately be her opportunity to show independence from big Democratic special interests while keeping them close through core issues such as minimum wage and climate change., Though the Trans-Pacific Partnership is hardly bright on the radar of most Americans, Democrats seeking to disrupt Clintons march to the nomination and win it themselves are doing their best to put it there., \"My strong hope is that Secretary Clinton and all candidates, Republicans and Democrats, will make it clear that the Trans-Pacific Partnership should be rejected and that we must develop trade policies that benefit working families, not just Wall Street and multinational corporations,\" said Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent liberal Vermonter positioning himself for a run., Former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley built a fundraising pitch around his effort to stop the agreement., Union members plan to hold dozens of protests against the pact across the country Saturday. The events follow the 86,000 calls to members of Congress they have logged and petitions with tens of thousands of signatures., Defeating the trade pact is a signature cause of progressive standard-bearer Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts. In a playful YouTube video, former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, who helped President Clinton negotiate NAFTA, uses an easel, drawing paper and a magic marker to explain why the Pacific agreement is \"the worst trade deal youve never heard of.\", Clintons allies argue her wait-and-see approach is reasonable., \"She and I  and her husband  have been talking about these issues for well over 20 years,\" a leading Democratic proponent of the trade pact, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, said at a breakfast Friday hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. \"Shes been a candidate for five days.\", The candidate has a nuanced history with free trade., During the 2008 Democratic primary, both she and then-Sen. Barack Obama campaigned as trade skeptics. But their positions changed once Obama was in the White House and Clinton was his secretary of State. There, the two worked together to advance the Pacific trade pact., \"She was very closely associated with this,\" said Scott Miller, an international trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies., Clinton championed the pact in a long piece she wrote for Foreign Policy magazine in 2011, saying it would \"bring together economies from across the Pacific. Our goal is to create not just more growth, but better growth.\", A retreat would be a major pivot away from her own legacy and her husbands., But the Democratic appetite for free trade has diminished along with the number of centrists in the party., That much was clear Friday morning in the way Wyden pitched the Pacific pact. He said it looks nothing like the agreements negotiated under President Clinton., \"We produced a proposal that is very different than trade policy in the 1990s,\" he said. \"The reference point for Democrats is really the 90s and NAFTA and the Clinton deals. This is very different.\", evan.halper@latimes.com, Twitter: @evanhalper, Times staff writer Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.]", "Date": "20150418", "Title": "[Pacific trade pact a tricky issue for Hillary Clinton's candidacy]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-trade-clinton-20150418-story.html", "Author": "[Evan Halper]"}
{"Content": "[[, Lawmakers on Wednesday approved new campaign rules in response to a controversy involving the political activities of suspended Sen. Ronald S. Calderon and his brother, former Assemblyman Tom Calderon, both Democrats from Montebello., The legislation, which now goes to the governor, would bar elected water board members throughout California from accepting campaign contributions of more than $250 from donors with business pending before their boards., The bill also would require board members to abstain from voting if they have accepted such a donation in the previous year., Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia (D-Bell Gardens) proposed the rules in response to reports by The Times that the Calderons had made large campaign donations to most members of the Central Basin Municipal Water District board before it approved a consulting contract for Tom Calderon., \"Given the scandals in my backyard with the Central Basin, this was important to me,\" Garcia said. Her bill is AB 1728., The U.S. attorneys office has subpoenaed records from the Central Basin district involving a contract with Tom Calderon. The Times reported last year that the district had paid Calderon more than $750,000 in consulting fees since 2004 for political and legislative advice., Less than three months before an August 2012 vote to extend his last contract, a Tom Calderon campaign group gave $10,000 to the reelection committee of water board member Phil Hawkins., Ed Vasquez, Rudy Montalvo and Art Chacon, who were then on the board, also voted for the extension. Vasquezs reelection committee received $6,433 in three contributions from Tom Calderon from February through May 2012. He also took in $4,400 from Sen. Ron Calderon that year., Montalvos reelection campaign received $6,262 from Tom Calderon in early 2012. Chacons campaign for the water board had a $3,000 contribution from Sen. Calderon in 2010., The state Senate suspended Sen. Calderon in March, after he was indicted on federal charges including bribery. Democratic Sens. Leland Yee of San Francisco and Roderick Wright of Los Angeles County were also suspended; Yee was indicted on public corruption charges and Wright was found guilty of perjury and voter fraud for lying about living in his district., All three have pleaded not guilty and are being paid because Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento) said the state Constitution does not allow salaries to be withheld from suspended lawmakers., On Wednesday, the Assembly approved a proposal (SCA 17 by Steinberg) for voters to consider in 2016 that would allow pay and benefits to be stripped from suspended legislators. The deadline for placing proposals on this years state ballot has passed., Lawmakers on Wednesday also gave final legislative approval to a measure that would prohibit elected officials and candidates from using their campaign funds to pay a spouse to work on the campaign.

{"Content": "[[, Leading candidates for the Republican presidential nomination split sharply Sunday on the same question that tripped up Jeb Bush last week: Was invading Iraq a mistake?, No, said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.): The 2003 invasion was the right decision because President George W. Bush had intelligence findings indicating that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction., Bush wasnt dealing with a Nobel Prize winner. He was dealing with Saddam Hussein, Rubio said. And he made the right decision based on the information he had at that time., At the other end of the GOP spectrum, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul stopped just short of saying that the U.S. would have done better to leave Hussein in power. He questioned whether toppling secular dictators in the Mideast had helped or hurt U.S. interests., I think when Hussein was toppled, we got chaos, Paul said. We still have chaos in Iraq. I think it emboldened Iran, he added. We now have the rise of radical Islam in Iraq as well., A third potential candidate, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, took a position closer to Rubio than Paul., I think any president, regardless of party, probably would have made a similar decision to what President Bush did at the time with the information that he had available, Walker said., Knowing what we know now, I think its safe for many of us, myself included, to say we probably wouldnt have taken that tack to launch an invasion, he said., Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, spent much of last week revising answers to the question of whether he agreed with his older brothers decision in 2003 to invade Iraq. After first saying yes, then calling the question hypothetical, he eventually settled on this answer:, If were all supposed to answer hypothetical questions knowing what we know now, what would you have done, I would have not engaged, I would not have gone into Iraq., Bushs shifting responses drew dismayed comments from Republican activists who said he seemed unprepared for an obvious question., While most of the potential candidates have focused on what they characterize as an intelligence failure in the prewar assessments of Iraqs weapons program, Pauls question about whether overthrowing dictators is a good idea involves a deeper disagreement with longtime GOP foreign policy., He has raised similar questions about U.S. policy toward Syria, where the Obama administration is, at least officially, committed to seeing President Bashar Assad removed from power., Paul has several times made the point that although Assad is a dictator, he has fought against Islamic radicals and defended the interests of Syrian Christians., Rubio, by contrast, has joined many other Republicans in chastising the administration for not doing more to overthrow Assad. On Sunday, he repeated his call for the U.S. to take a more muscular approach, saying the administration should find a group on the ground in Syria that we could work with., Rubio made his remarks on Fox News Sunday; Paul was interviewed on NBCs Meet the Press; Walker was interviewed on CBS Face the Nation., The three also differed in how they analyzed negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program., Paul, asked if he would consider using military force against a country trying to develop a nuclear weapons program, said the U.S. always should have the threat of military force behind diplomacy., But I would prefer diplomacy. I think we can still have negotiations, he said. We negotiated with the Soviets for 70 years, and we ended up coming to a peaceful outcome., My hope is really that negotiations continue, he said. There are some in my party who say, Oh, I dont want any negotiations. Theyre ready to be done with it, he added. But once youre done with negotiations, the choices are war, or they get a weapon, and I dont wanna have just those two binary choices., Rubio disagreed. The outlines of negotiations to contain Irans nuclear programs are much worse than anybody anticipated, he said. And, in fact, every time theres a new revelation about the deal, it gets worse and worse and worse., Walker said that any agreement with Iran must include full dismantling of what he characterized as its illicit nuclear infrastructure, which he said was a real threat to Israel as well as the U.S. allies among the Arab states of the Persian Gulf., The deal the administration has been negotiating with Iran would put new limits on what Iran can do with its nuclear facilities and would impose new inspections on them, but would not dismantle them., Not surprisingly, the one area on which all three would-be nominees agreed was in criticizing former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the likely Democratic candidate., If she ever takes questions, reporters should ask Clinton, Was it a good idea to invade Libya? during Obamas first term, Paul said. Did that make us less safe? Did it make it more chaotic? Did it allow radical Islam and ISIS to grow stronger?, I think the war in Iraq is a good question, he said, but so is the question of Should we have gone into Libya? , Rubio criticized Clinton for her position on Iraq during the latter part of the Bush presidency. We dont know how she justifies, for example, not supporting the surge in Iraq and these sorts of other things, he said. Clinton, who was a senator from New York at the time, opposed the 2007 surge., Paul, asked about surveillance provision of the Patriot Act, which is scheduled to expire at the end of this month, noted that a federal appeals court in New York earlier this month had ruled that the governments collection of records of U.S. telephone calls was illegal. So really, it oughta stop., You can catch terrorists, he said. Judges will grant warrants when investigators have a specific person they want to pursue, he said., The Senate is to take up the Patriot Act this week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called for an extension of the surveillance provisions through the end of July to give Congress more time to work on replacement legislation.

{"Content": "[[, Legislators and protesters have taken their positions, the stage in the state Capitolisset, and the curtain has drawn up on another labor drama in Wisconsin., Lawmakers in the Republican-dominated Legislature on Tuesday began debating legislation that would probably dramatically weaken Wisconsin unions if passed and approved by Gov. Scott Walker, a potential 2016 Republican presidential hopeful., The state Senates labor committee on Tuesday morning beganhearing an expected full day of testimony and public comment over a Republican proposal toban private sector unions from requiring nonmembers under their representation to pay dues., The five-member, Republican-led committee is expected to then vote on the bill and send it to the Senate for possible deliberation Wednesday., Conservativessay the legislation would make the statemore attractive for businesses. Critics say the so-called right-to-work legislation -- which exists in 24 states -- would inevitably decrease union membership in Wisconsin and further diminish thepower of unions, which tend to support Democrats.

The battle has revived memories of the dramatic 2011 labor showdown at which protesters occupied the Capitol and Democratic lawmakers fled the state to block avote overlimiting collective bargaining for public workers., Walker eventually emerged victorious in that fight and with a high profile on the national stageafter signing the legislation into law in March 2011., The current battle centers on who has to pay union dues., Essentially, in workplaces where a majority of workers have elected a union to represent them in contract bargaining with employers, the union represents all members of that workplace regardless of whether they support the union, said Paul Secunda, professor of law and director of the labor and employment law program at the Marquette University Law School., The proposed law would ban unions from drawing dues from nonsupporting members, who would still nonetheless get the benefits of union bargaining for betterwages and benefits, Secunda told the Los Angeles Times., \"The union is stuck. They have to represent all employees in the bargaining unit, and if they dont, they can get sued for breach of duty of [fair] representation,\" Secunda said. But for those who dont want to pay dues, Secunda said, \"theyre not legally required to anymore ... so the union is out of business because theres no money to support what it does in the workplace., Republican lawmakers, led by Senate Majority Leader Scott L. Fitzgerald, argue that a right-to-work law would draw new jobsfrom other states and encourage current employers to stay., \"In order to see our economy continue to compete at a global level, we cannot remain mired in an antiquated system,\" Fitzgerald said Tuesday in prepared remarks., Observers sayWalker has flip-flopped his position on such legislation. After surviving thebruising 2011 legislative fight and an ensuing recall election, Walker made it clearhe would not support right-to-work bills., \"I have no interest in pursuing right-to-work legislation in this state,\" Walkertold reporters at the state Republican Partys annual convention in 2012, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel., \"Im going to do everything in my power to make sure it [doesnt come to my desk]because my focal point [is] private sector unions have overwhelmingly come to the table to be my partner in economic development,\" he said., As recently as September, during his most recent gubernatorial campaign, Walker said that right-to-work legislation was not part of his agenda, but on Feb. 20, he told the Journal Sentinelhe would support Fitzgeraldsbill., The fact-checkingservice PolitiFact Wisconsin rated Walkers change of heart as a \"full flop.\", Follow @MattDPearce for national news.]", "Date": "20150224", "Title": "[Another labor showdown looming in Wisconsin, with Walker center stage]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-wisconsin-labor-showdown-20150224-story.html", "Author": "[Matt Pearce]"}
{"Content": "[[, Less than two years into office, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus government collapsed Tuesday as he fired two ministers who lead parties in his ruling coalition., Ending a protracted political crisis and speculation about early elections, Netanyahu dismissed Justice Minister Tzipi Livni and Finance Minister Yair Lapid and said he would move to dissolve parliament and call for elections., Addressing Israelis at a prime-time televised news conference, Netanyahu accused the two ministers of repeatedly challenging his policies and leadership, citing examples such as Lapids criticism of construction in East Jerusalem and Livnis meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas against the prime ministers instructions., I will no longer tolerate an opposition within the government, I will not tolerate ministers attacking the policy and head of the government from within, Netanyahu said in announcing the changes. He accused the two of waging ugly old politics., Four other ministers from Lapids centrist Yesh Atid party quit in protest of his dismissal. Yaakov Peri, resigning as science minister, called Netanyahus remarks hesitant, cowardly and even slightly hysterical., Livni also had harsh words, calling Netanyahu a petty politician and noting that other ministers had criticized him strongly without being fired. The head of the liberal Movement party, Livni has been Israels chief negotiator with the Palestinians., Netanyahu is the second-longest serving prime minister in Israels history. But the outgoing government, his third, is one of the shortest-lived. This government was contrarian from the start, Netanyahu said., An opposition bill to dissolve the Knesset, Israels 120-seat parliament, is already slated for discussion Wednesday and is expected to pass., Approval would start the clock ticking toward general elections, expected in March. The Cabinet would remain in place until a new government is formed after elections, although responsibilities of fired or resigned ministers would have to be entrusted to caretakers., Previously, elections were not expected until 2016., The five-party coalition Netanyahu formed after the last elections in January 2013 was divided from the beginning on a wide range of key issues, including the peace process with the Palestinians, settlements and economic policies, but managed to coexist on other matters., Political differences between liberal and hawkish members were further challenged over the last year by a chain of events including the peace talks and their collapse, the war in the Gaza Strip, settlement controversy and the recent wave of terrorist attacks., The fraying coalition unraveled rapidly in recent weeks amid fierce clashing between Netanyahu and his top ministers over increasingly contentious legislation, and the budget and economic issues. Coupled with an increasingly restive hawkish contingent within Netanyahus Likud Party, infighting in effect paralyzed the government., The latest deadlock was sparked by a bill declaring Israel to be a Jewish state, and a budget that put Livni and Lapid on a collision course with Netanyahu. The confrontation became increasingly personal., A series of last-minute meetings between Netanyahu and the leaders of his coalition partners failed to stop the downward spiral of his feuding government. Livni and Lapid charged that Netanyahus efforts were not sincere., Fierce accusations flew after a late-night meeting between Netanyahu and Lapid, after which the prime minister said elections would be preferable to the continued existence of a Cabinet whose ministers sabotage the governments actions against the public interest., Lapid accused Netanyahu of acting irresponsibly and reneging on promised support for the budget and economic reform, both geared to lowering the cost of living., We had an alternative, a good alternative, Lapid said, adding that billions of dollars will now be wasted on elections rather than going to education, welfare and health. The cost of elections is estimated to be about $500 million. In coming months, planned reforms will be suspended and government expenditures limited until the next government passes a budget., According to Livni, elections will not be about the economy but a choice between moderate Israeli Zionism and dangerous extremists that mustnt be allowed to take over the country. She called for a more centrist government that would fight terror but also make the necessary diplomatic decisions., At a news conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Secretary of State John F. Kerry declined to comment on Netanyahus actions but said he hoped elections would produce the possibility of a government that can negotiate and move towards resolving the differences between Israelis and Palestinians., The Labor Party, which heads the opposition, kicked off its campaign two weeks ago, with the slogan Israels stuck with Bibi, referring to the prime minister by his nickname and suggesting that the country cannot move forward under his leadership., This week, opposition leader Isaac Herzog said Netanyahu had failed in every parameter and brought the country to a dead end in diplomacy, security and the economy., Israels political system has taken sharp U-turns in similar situations in the past, but the crisis appeared beyond repair Tuesday., Israelis dont really understand why we are headed to elections after less than two years, but that doesnt matter.

{"Content": "[[, Like so many political events, the U.S. Supreme Court decision on Monday that upheld the right of independent citizen commissions to draw district lines inspired a different reaction in California than elsewhere in the nation., Here, it was a victory for Republicans, spared the alternative of having the strongly Democratic Legislature draw lines that would have carved into the GOPs already paltry number of elected officials. Elsewhere, it was a defeat for Republicans, who control legislatures in places like Arizona, where the case originated, and wanted the restoration of the legislatures power to draw lines beneficial to their party., \"In Arizona, the Republicans are upset today, but in California the Democrats might be a little less happy than they might have been otherwise,\" said Jessica A. Levinson, clinical professor of law at Loyola Law School, who specializes in election law. \"Redistricting can sometimes make for strange bedfellows.\", The partisan benefits were not terribly clear in the public reactions of elected officials, many of whom skipped over the political fallout to emphasize their support for the Mom-and-apple-pie notion of citizen involvement, enshrined by two ballot measures., \"Todays decision by the nations highest court supporting redistricting commissions is a victory for Californias open and publicly accessible redistricting process,\" state Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Lenof Los Angeles and Assembly Speaker Toni G. Atkins of San Diego, both Democrats, said in a statement. \"We hope other states will follow suit now that the court has removed any question about its constitutionality.\", \"California voters overwhelmingly approved Propositions 11 and 20 to take the redistricting process out of the hands of elected officials and give it to an independent body,\" Senate GOP leader Bob Huff of San Dimas said in his statement. \"The courts decision will ensure that Californians will continue to have an open and fair redistricting process.\", The measured nature of the responses reflected the limited effect of the Arizona case on California  at most a few seats would have been affected had the court gone the other way. But waiting in the wings is a far more consequential case that will be heard by the high court next year., That case, Evenwel vs. Abbott, will determine whether district lines are drawn to accommodate a number of residents or a number of eligible voters. The latter category would exclude noncitizens and the young. Many of Californias most powerful Democrats represent districts whose outlines would change dramatically were the court to upend tradition in the Texas case., A court decision to change the defining number from residents to those eligible to vote \"would have a massive impact on national redistricting and specifically on the ability to create districts that empower minority groups  Latinos, Asians, even African Americans,\" said Paul Mitchell, a California redistricting expert., If applied to congressional elections, Mitchell said, a Texas decision could force the combining of urban districts as they now exist in places like metro Los Angeles and the Bay Area and, apart from California, in states like Texas, Florida and New York. (The same would be true at the legislative level, which are specifically included in the case.), The result, he said, would be \"a major shift in voting power\" of Latinos and African Americans. A work-up by Mitchell of the nations congressional districts demonstrated how dramatic the effect would be of a Texas ruling citing the need for eligible voters., Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allards eastside Los Angeles district, for example, would suddenly need an influx of nearly 150,000 eligible voters, as the district would be about half the size it needs to be if those not eligible to vote are brushed aside. Nearby districts are in a similar situation, and thus candidates for combining. (One complication of the Texas case is that its not clear exactly what would make up an eligible voter; the case refers only to \"voters or potential voters\" compared to the population at large.), The winners in the Arizona case announced Monday were Republicans representing districts for which the independent commission drew less-partisan lines than the Democratic Legislature otherwise would have. Among members of Congress, they included Reps. David Valadao of Hanford, Jeff Denham of Turlock and Stephen Knight of Palmdale. All three already are on the GOPs endangered incumbents list for 2016., Democrats also lost an opportunity to strengthen some of their weakest incumbents, including Rep. Ami Bera of Elk Groveand Scott Peters of San Diego. Both survived strong challenges in 2014. Peters district has a one-point Republican registration edge, and Beras a two-point Democratic advantage. Each has a substantial number of nonpartisan voters as well., Before the independent commission was created, those seats would have been redrawn by Democrats in the Legislature to benefit their party incumbents. Opposition to such gerrymandering was the chief argument of the two ballot measures to put control in the hands of the commissionone in 2008, which controlled legislative line-drawing, and a second in 2010 that extended its power to congressional lines., \"The independent redistricting commissions typically do make life and elections harder for incumbents,\" Levinson said. \"The losers today are self-interested incumbents.\", cathleen.decker@latimes.com, Twitter: @cathleendecker.

{"Content": "[[, Los Angeles County officials and business leaders rose to the defense of a Japanese company Monday that has all but given up plans to build a $60-million manufacturing facility in the Antelope Valley because of a dispute with local labor leaders., UPDATE:Japanese firm is ready to scrap plans for Palmdale rail-car factory, Two years ago, Osaka-based Kinkisharyo International won an $890-million contract to build 175 light-rail cars for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority., Most of the parts will be built in Japan, but the firm agreed to perform final assembly, including painting and wiring the cars, in Los Angeles County. It has been doing that from a temporary facility in Palmdale., Kinkisharyo leaders said they hoped to build a permanent plant that would allow them to also move some heavy rail car manufacturing from Japan to the United States., The 60-acre Palmdale site that Kinkisharyo chose, however, came under fire this summer when local activistsincluding members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 11presented the city with a 588-page appeal claiming violations of state environmental law. The document says the factory has not secured proper water rights, and that construction could kick up spores that carry Valley fever., At a news conference Monday, Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich, a Metro board member,accused labor leaders of greenmail tacticsusing the environmental law as leverage to convince Kinkisharyo to promise that its workforce would be unionized., Kinkisharyo recently refused a request for a card check agreement, in which a company agrees to recognize a union if a majority of workers sign cards asking for one. The optional process is favored by labor leaders because it avoids the riskier alternative, holding an election on the factory floor., We offer good salaries and good benefits, and weve never had a labor issue, Donald Boss, Kinkisharyos general manager of program management, told The Times. If our employees want to organize, they can. But we arent going to organize for them., The appeal has already delayed the factorys construction by four months and has cost Kinkisharyo at least $2 million, Boss said. He added that Metros ambitious schedule for the rail car deliveryan average of four new vehicles a monthleaves little room for delay., All final assembly of the Metro cars will stay in Palmdale, and the 134 people who have been hired will keep their jobs, Boss said. But the heavy manufacturing work will probably leave California. The company is touring factories in Arizona, Arkansas, Nevada, Texas, Idaho and Oregon., People need to know what these scorched-earth politics are really going to bring, said Carol Schatz, the president of the Central City Assn. of Los Angeles. Elected officials urged Gov. Jerry Brown to convince the law firm that authored the environmental appeal to withdraw it and let construction on the factory begin., IBEWs goal is to chase this plant and these jobs out of California, said Gary Toebben, the president and chief executive of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. He said losing the plant would give the state a scarlet letter and signal to investors that doing business in California isnt worth it., The IBEW did not return requests for comment., Maria Elena Durazo, who heads the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, the regions largest union voice, said in an interview that Kinkisharyo will violate its contract with Metro if it takes any jobs out of state. She added that the firm has done nothing but treat [labor] as if we were outsiders., Theyre behind schedule, and now theyre going to use this as an excuse to not deliver on what they were supposed to do, Durazo said. Anything else they mention is a distraction of the fundamental issue., In a statement, Madeline Janis, the director of a coalition of labor and community groups, said public officials ought to hold Kinkisharyo to its obligations to taxpayers, rather than blaming labor unions., Metros deputy executive officer for procurement, Victor Ramirez, said the first car, a test model, was delivered a week ahead of schedule and that Kinkisharyo is in full compliance with their contract., Palmdale Mayor James C. Ledford Jr. said he hoped the new factory could become a permanent source of skilled labor for Kinkisharyo after the Metro contract ends., Metro has struggled for years to acquire enough rail cars for the countys rapidly growing transit network. A $300-million deal with the Italian firm AnsaldoBreda to build 100 light-rail vehicles fell apart in late 2009, putting Metro more than two years behind its original schedule., The agency needs a major shipment of new vehicles for two new light-rail routes to Santa Monica and Azusa, which are scheduled to open in 2016., For more Los Angeles transportation news, follow@laura_nelsonon Twitter.]", "Date": "20141020", "Title": "[Business leaders say labor is pushing rail car plant from L.A.

President Obama and Michael Bloomberg, then mayor of New York, were furious that the public was not warned in advance., Eleven days after the flyover, Caldera resigned after less than five months on the job. The controversy, he toldObama in a letter,made it impossible for him to effectively lead the White House office that oversees about 2,000 military personnel assigned to the president., The incident was one of the most widely publicized of Calderas career.

He lamented, for example, Californias enactment of tens of thousands of laws during his 45 years in politics., Although many of those were important to ensure public safety, protect civil rights or fight pollution, he said, the ever-growing reach of state bureaucracy needs to be checked., \"Its like Gulliver being tied by these Lilliputians, with more and more little strings and ropes,\" the former Oakland mayor said, describing how a thicket of building restrictions unnecessarily hamstrung redevelopment of the hardscrabble downtown neighborhoods of the city., \"So just signing the law and it goes into the code books  thats the beginning, not the end,\" he said. \"I intend to do a lot more follow-through work in the next four years.\", Policy changes needing further attention, he said, include a shift to local control over certain school funds and prison realignment, which sends low-level felons to local jails rather than state prisons., Brown, 76, cast himself as a wiser manager of the states giant bureaucracy than he was during his first two terms, from 1975 to 1983. He also suggested hed finally mastered Californias political complexities, saying he was squirreling away much of his campaign money for ballot measure campaigns that he might need to mount during a final term., \"There may be things to be done that will involve a ballot measure,\" he said. \"Im not going to disclose\" what they might be. But \"I do think having a credible war chest will overcome whatever infirmities lame-duck governors might ordinarily suffer from.\", Brown said hed learned from his failure in the mid-1970s to build a war chest that he could have used to push an alternative to Proposition 13, the 1978 initiative that capped property tax hikes and has bedeviled elected officials ever since., Brown was definitive that he would not seek to change the law, a third rail in California politics. But he left open the possibility of altering other tax laws., \"Prop. 13 is a sacred doctrine that should never be questioned,\" he said. \"That doesnt mean that we cant look at our tax code in various ways.\", In 2010, Brown pledged not to raise taxes without voters consent, even though Sacramento can increase levies without the publics permission. He declined to make a similar vow now., And although Brown insisted that the tax increase he took to the ballot in 2012  Proposition 30  was temporary and he had no intention to make it permanent, he did not rule out an extension., \"Tax reform is difficult  thats why I havent talked a lot about it  but Im not ruling it out,\" he said, adding that his goal is to replace the revenue provided by Proposition 30 with money saved from paying down the states debt by the time the measure expires., \"Were trying to manage so we can do without it,\" he said. \"But it is challenging.\", Kashkari has hammered Brown for his ties with the powerful California Teachers Assn., which has spent millions of dollars supporting the incumbents campaigns. Brown said he believes he could serve as a bridge between warring factions  the teachers unions and those who seek to change teacher tenure, seniority and evaluation systems., \"The issue du jour is firing teachers, that through that one mechanism of firing a very small number of teachers, that that is the leverage point that will transform the entire school. Well thats just not true,\" Brown said. \"Most kids are dealing with teachers that under no scenario of reform would ever be fired.\", Though dismissal procedures are a serious issue, getting teacher qualification, development and evaluation right are critical for schools long-term health, he said., \"It cant all be just about more rules and more money, and thats basically what Sacramento does.\", Brown said he had no regrets, perhaps aside from not meeting his wife, Anne, earlier., He repeatedly pointed to his experiences and seasoning  as governor in the 1970s, as mayor of Oakland, as a presidential candidate  as the source of his surer hand and greater clarity than he had in his first stint as governor., \"I govern from a base of enormous experience,\" he said. \"I am more penetrating in my understanding than I was 35 years ago. I think thats very helpful.\", Brown has ruled out a run for president in 2016. But he declined to rule out another bid for Oakland mayor., \"I wouldnt mind being mayor of Oakland,\" Brown said. \"But I dont know, when Im 80 and a half, whether Ill have the same appetite. Im very excited doing this job.\", Still, he said, \"I dont want to foreclose my options for four years from now.\", @LATSeema, @ finneganLAT]", "Date": "20141019", "Title": "[ An experienced Jerry Brown vows to build on what he's already done]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-pol-jerry-brown-20141019-story.html", "Author": "[Seema Mehta, Michael Finnegan]"}
{"Content": "[[, Making plain what he has vaguely hinted, Jeb Bush instantly scrambled the still-early 2016 presidential race Tuesday by announcing he would form a political action committee allowing him to explore a possible White House bid., The PACs purposes will be to support leaders, ideas and policies that will expand opportunity and prosperity for all Americans, Bush, the son and younger brother of former presidents, wrote in posts on Twitter and his Facebook page. In the coming months, I hope to visit with many of you and have a conversation about restoring the promise of America., Practically speaking, Bushs announcement was just a tiny step down a path the former Florida governor had already seemed to be following. But it left a considerable footprint., The move banished any doubts about Bushs interest in running  doubts he himself had fanned by publicly equivocating about the personal toll and political difficulties of seeking the office. Can I do it where the sacrifice for my family is tolerable? Bush mused at a Wall Street Journal conference this month. Its a big sacrifice, because its a pretty ugly business right now., Indeed, the harsh reaction from some quarters signaled that Bush could face a grueling, divisive fight for the nomination. Another Bush versus another Clinton, L. Brent Bozell III, a longtime conservative activist, posted on Twitter, referring to a possible November 2016 matchup with former First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. Political vomit., Even those reacting with more restraint pointed up a hurdle that Bush, like Clinton, would have to overcome: Neither is exactly a fresh face., I dont think we need another Bush, period, Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma told reporters on Capitol Hill. I like them all, but I dont think we need another Bush., The most immediate effect of Tuesdays announcement fell on the many Republicans already engaged at various stages of seeking the presidency. Some, like Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida, had formed their own leadership PACs, which function as the equivalent of a campaign organization in waiting., Rubio, who was mentored by Bush as he rose through the ranks of Florida politics, seems unlikely to challenge his former patron in a bid for the GOP nomination, though Rubio suggested Tuesday his decision would not be based on who else makes the race., I have a lot of respect for Gov. Bush and I think hell be a very formidable candidate if he decides to run, Rubio said. From my perspective, my decisions going to be based on where I can best advance my agenda for restoring the American dream., Bushs move also placed considerable pressure on other prospects who would most likely vie with him for support of the Republican establishment., The boomlet behind a third Mitt Romney bid is likely to lose a great deal of whatever momentum it had. Others vying for establishment support, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and two Midwestern governors, Wisconsins Scott Walker and Ohios John Kasich, will suddenly have to rethink their plans  or, at the least, the timing of their decisions., Hes now gotten ahead of everyone else, said Bobbie Kilberg, a major Republican donor in Virginia who worked for both President Bushes. I think this may force the hand of other candidates in the center-right arena to move earlier than perhaps they wanted to. This puts some pressure on donors to also move more quickly than they thought they would., Donors and activists in Florida are now in a bit of a quandary, said GOP strategist Ana Navarro  though she made it fairly clear where she stood., I love Marco Rubio. I love Jeb Bush. I have loved Jeb longer, Navarro said., Paradoxically, there is much that remains unknown about the prospects of a Bush candidacy, notwithstanding his household name and dynastic status., The Republican Party is different than it was in 2000, when it nominated Bushs brother, George W., and vastly different than in 1988, when his father, George H.W. Bush, was the partys choice for president. During much of that time, Jeb Bush, who left the governorship in 2007 after two terms, was out of elective office., Many in the party have little use for the compassionate conservatism that George W. Bush promoted, or the pragmatism George H.W. Bush displayed., Jeb Bushs moderate position on immigration and support for Common Core, a set of recommended national education standards, places him at odds with many conservative activists, a bloc that holds considerable sway in the GOP nominating process., Lately, Bushs business dealings have also come under renewed scrutiny. In addition to serving on corporate boards and giving paid speeches, Bush holds leadership positions in offshore private equity funds that are partly financed by foreign investors, according to a Bloomberg report. If he runs for president, Bushs business ties and moneymaking ventures will doubtless be mined by his opponents, both Republican and Democrat, as were Romneys business dealings., Bush had taken several steps in recent weeks that pointed toward a White House bid. He huddled privately with some longtime advisors and sent personal emails to major GOP donors saying that if he ran in 2016 he hoped to have their support. Last weekend, in a television interview with Miamis WPLG, Bush announced he was writing an e-book and would release 250,000 emails from his years as governor  a level of transparency other candidates may be expected to follow., At the same time he has openly pondered whether he can find joy in the ruthless business of running for president, a process that has grown even more relentless and caustic with the advent of the never-ending news cycle and hyper-partisan media. Im not saying, Oh, woe is me. ... Dont get me wrong, Bush said at the Wall Street Journal event. Ive got to really do a lot of soul-searching., Presumably, his travels under the auspices of his new PAC will help answer his lingering questions. But Democrats werent waiting for a final decision to begin launching their attacks., Jeb Bush has fully embraced the failed economic agenda that benefits only a select few at the expense of the middle class, said Democratic National Committee spokesman Mo Elleithee. Thats not going to change no matter how many different ways he says he may run., mark.barabak@latimes.com, seema.mehta@latimes.com, Twitter: @markzbarabak, @latseema, Times staff writers Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, Many members of Congress remain deeply skeptical of the landmark deal announced Tuesday to halt Irans nuclear ambitions but are unlikely to have the votes to stop it., While Democrats largely back President Obamas pursuit of an agreement to lift sanctions on Iran in return for measures to prevent the country from building nuclear weapons, Republicans, who have the majority in the House and Senate, say the administration should walk away from a deal they fear concedes too much., But in a promising sign for Obama, few Democrats stood up publicly Tuesday to oppose the deal and the partys presidential front-runner, Hillary Rodham Clinton, expressed support., The final outcome will probably turn on a core group of centrist Democrats in the House and Senate, along with a handful of Republicans, whose votes could determine whether the agreement holds., I think people are going to understand that were in a deteriorating situation in the Middle East, and this offers an opportunity to turn the page, said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. I know we have a lot of geniuses around here, but I would just hope that people would hold their fire., Clinton gave lawmakers similar advice during an unusual daylong series of private meetings with House and Senate caucuses on Capitol Hill, where she spoke favorably of the agreement reached with the U.S., Iran and other major countries., After the morning session with Clinton, Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman of Sherman Oaks, who has concerns about the deal, said lawmakers options are limited. We cannot be as tough as the tough guys want to be on Iran so long as the president of the U.S. supports this deal, he said. Youre trying to pressure and cajole and threaten Tehran from Capitol Hill., Congress has 60 days to vote on the agreement, keeping the issue at the forefront of congressional politics and the 2016 presidential campaign., House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), who bypassed the White House earlier this year by inviting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to criticize the deal in an address to Congress, promised a fight., \"This isnt about Republicans versus Democrats,\" Boehner said. \"We will fight a bad deal that is wrong for our national security and wrong for our country.\", Although Congress may have enough votes to pass a resolution of disapproval, there would not likely be the two-thirds majority required to overturn Obamas promised veto, allowing the agreement to stand., Republicans are eager for a veto showdown over foreign policy with Obama, believing the public  or at least their constituents  would be on their side., Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton, who this year wrote a provocative public letter against the deal to the Iranian government, called it a \"grievous, dangerous mistake.\", But what became clear Tuesday was that although the Republicans in the House would almost certainly be able to pass the disapproval resolution under their majority-rules voting structure, the Senate outcome is less certain., In the Senate, a 60-vote threshold is needed to advance legislation over a filibuster. Although several key Democrats are deeply skeptical of the deal, the lack of immediate opposition from within the presidents party offered a potentially positive development for the administration as it tries to rally public support., \"First thing is to not tear down this agreement before the ink is even dry, before we even read it, said Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), among those who could sway the vote. Congress has a role now, by law, and its to thoroughly scrutinize the details of the agreement., Final votes are not expected until September, guaranteeing a lobbying blitz by the White House and the deals opponents, including Israel., Supporting or opposing this agreement is not a decision to be made lightly, and I plan to carefully study the agreement before making an informed decision, Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said., The 60-day clock does not start ticking until the administration sends the full agreement to Congress, which by law must be five days from striking the deal., The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), is expected to launch hearings next week., \"I begin from a place of deep skepticism that the deal actually meets the goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,\" Corker said. \"Congress will need to scrutinize this deal and answer whether implementing the agreement is worth dismantling our painstakingly constructed sanctions regime.\", House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) welcomed the deal, but said Congress \"must maintain our vigilance.\", Theres a block of members here who will really decide whether this agreement is sustained or not, said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank). I would hope all of us give the pros and cons of this agreement serious consideration, and also look soberly at the alternatives., For the latest from Congress and the 2016 campaign, follow @LisaMascaro., 2:41 p.m.: The story was updated with additional background and reaction., The story was originally published at 9:39 a.m.]", "Date": "20150714", "Title": "[Some Democrats voice concerns on Iran deal but so far appear ready to support Obama]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-congress-reaction-iran-20150714-story.html", "Author": "[Lisa Mascaro]"}
{"Content": "[[, Many Republican tears have been shed over the partys inability to win over Latino voters in California. And many more have been shed over the partys inability to win over the states Asian voters, at least in big ticket races. And now theres another, more surprising reason for Republicans to fret., Are they losing white voters too?, Nationally, as well as in California, white voters  specifically, older white voters  have been the backbone of the Republican Party. That worked, as long as older white voters were the backbone of the states politics. Not so much any more., Now, when it comes to voters, formerly homogenous California is an amalgam of races: 24% Latino, 9% Asian, 6% African American. More than 4 in 10 voters are non-white, according to a new USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll., And of the white voters, fewer are Republican than in decades past: Little more than a third of white voters were registered as Democrats, almost precisely the number registered as Republicans. (Two in 10 white voters were registered independents.), Interested in the stories shaping California? Sign up for the free Essential California newsletter >>, The Republican figures among whites were good, however, compared with their numbers among non-whites. Republicans were under-represented among African American, Latino and Asian voters; their largest bloc was the 18% of Latinos who were Republican. When minority voters were taken together, only 17% were registered Republicans, while 52% were Democrats and 27% independents, who in California side hugely with the Democratic Party., The reasons for the fading Republican presence are many. The Latino portion of the puzzle rests on 1994s Proposition 187, the effort to ban the use of state services byimmigrants in the country illegally. Pushed by a Republican governor, Pete Wilson, it was seen by Latinos of all statuses as an attack on close family and community members. The response? To flee to the Democratic Party, or become an independent, effectively Democratic voter., As white voters objections to illegal immigration have eased over the decades, more white voters here recoiled at the partys stance. And there was more: Women felt alienated by a party that blocked workplace protections for them and campaigned against abortion rights and contraception. Young voters, white or otherwise, looked askance at GOP opposition to gay rights and, later, same-sex marriage. A state with religious affiliations that are lower than the national average bridled at the increasing evangelical dominance of the party., \"It has been a perfect storm over the years,\" said Allan Hoffenblum, a former Republican strategist who runs the California Target Book, a nonpartisan compendium of state political races. And there is more than a slight chance that it could spread to other states as they work through similar demographic changes, he said: \"This is something Ive been warning about.\", In recent California elections, the combination of increasing numbers of minority voters and whites slumping allegiance has been toxic for Republicans. As Hoffenblum noted, through 1998 Republicans owned statewide offices; since then the wins have petered out., As recently as the 2010 election, exit polls showed, whites were 61% of the states voters; Sen. Barbara Boxer lost them by 10 points and Gov. Jerry Brown lost them by 5 points. In 2012s presidential contest, whites were down to 55% of the vote, and President Obama lost them by 8 points., No California exit polls were taken in 2014,  the price of holding a gubernatorial contest whose result was a foregone conclusion  but a USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll taken a week before the election showed Brown winning white voters by 9 points. Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom was winning whites by 7 points, and two other candidates  Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris and Treasurer John Chiang  also were winning whites handily., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, State Republicans have worked for years to redefine their brand, electing more women and minority members to the Legislature and grooming them for leadership positions. Their candidate for controller last year was the well-regarded Fresno Mayor Ashley Swearengin, who, were she a Democrat, would be among the top ranks for statewide office. But redefining the party has been problematic in a state generally disinterested in politics and whose Capitol is outside a big media market., The presidential campaign, which arrives here in earnest for Wednesdays presidential debate in Simi Valley, has done little to bolster the partys brand here, replete as it has been with fights over immigration, Planned Parenthood and same-sex marriage, the kinds of issues that alienated rising voters in the first place. The combination of a contentious and sharply conservative presidential campaign, and no countering brand definition by California Republicans, threatens more retrenchment, many Republicans say., \"One of the big problems in California is there really is no California Republican voice,\" said one party veteran, who spoke anonymously to preserve business relationships. \"What voters hear is the national party. There really isnt anyone helping California voters  understand that Republicans in D.C. and Republicans in the South dont necessarily speak for Republicans in California.\", There are the California Republicans struggling for notice, he said, and then there are the loud and braying voices on the presidential campaign, reinforcing an image that many Republicans here would like to leave in the dust., \"If you think about it, the mayor of Fresno is trying to have a louder conversation than Donald Trump and Ted Cruz,\" he said. \"That is a nearly impossible task.\", cathleen.decker@latimes.comTwitter: @cathleendecker, For more on politics, go to www.latimes.com/decker and www.latimes.com/politics., MORE INCALIFORNIA POLITICS:, Legislature leaves anti-tobacco measures and health plan tax on the table, The inside story of how power struggles doomed Jerry Browns top priority, Politics at the local level pointless?

{"Content": "[[, Mayor Eric Garcettis appearance last fall at an auditorium across the street from Los Angeles City Hall drew scant attention. It was a gathering of watershed protection specialists, and hed come with an ardent appeal: Join him the following week at a federal hearing on the L.A. River., The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was weighing plans to tear apart some of the rivers \"concrete straitjacket,\" as the mayor put it, and restore wetlands along the banks. Garcetti was lobbying hard for the most expensive option, a $1-billion proposal that federal officials were resisting., \"Lets not go halfway on the heart and soul of a great city,\" he told the audience. \"Cancel whatever plans you have. Take your wife or husband out another night.\", The hearing was packed and the mayor went on to press his fight in Washington. Eight months later, the Army Corps  defying expectations  recommended the plan Garcetti wanted., Approval by Congress is still uncertain. But Garcettis campaign for a dramatic rehabilitation of an 11-mile stretch of the river stands as a rare case of the mayor taking a bold political gamble to reshape a broad swath of Los Angeles for future generations., In his first year as mayor, Garcetti has more often taken a low-risk approach to the job, avoiding potentially messy fights over taxes and spending on signature projects., His \"back-to-basics\" agenda  making City Hall more efficient and effective with up-to-date technology  is supposed to result in smoother streets and sidewalks, less hassle getting building permits and quicker 911 response times., Garcetti says hes strategically building a foundation to revitalize the citys economy and improve its quality of life. But his approach also raises the question of whether he is shying from confrontation and playing it too safe., Franklin D. Gilliam Jr., dean of UCLAs Luskin School of Public Affairs, said Garcettis emphasis on internal city operations is \"small ball\" at a time when Los Angeles faces large-scale challenges  substandard schools, high unemployment and an affordable housing shortage., \"Im just looking for a way to knit this all together,\" Gilliam said. \"You have people in large parts of South L.A., East L.A. and other parts, some in the north Valley, who are really up against it. What are they offering them? What are they doing for them?\", During Garcettis tenure on the City Council, two L.A. mayors took big political risks with mixed results. Mayor James K. Hahn replaced an African American police chief, Bernard C. Parks, with William J. Bratton, who was widely viewed as a success. But it undercut Hahns political base among African Americans, and he lost his 2005 campaign for reelection., Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa reaped dividends by pushing for a Westside subway and other transit lines. But he also spent nearly two years fighting to take over the Los Angeles Unified School District, only to see his plan struck down by a judge., Garcetti advisors say modernizing the citys lumbering bureaucracy is no small undertaking, and long overdue. Computer systems are outdated and incompatible, they say, and it takes an average of 432 days to award a contract. It matters, they add, that the city has sharply cut the length of time that callers are placed on hold when they phone 311, the hotline for reporting graffiti, illegal dumping and other nuisances., \"Eric Garcetti has much more ambitious goals for the city, but he wants to put first things first,\" said Rick Cole, the deputy mayor for budget and innovation. \"Those big goals cant be achieved if government isnt effective at achieving results.\", In an interview in his City Hall office, Garcetti said he had \"brought the sensibility of a CEO\" to his job, imposing annual performance reviews on all agency managers. He took credit for firing more than half a dozen department executives., \"It was a big, bold move to interview everybody, and by the end probably a third of them will have gone,\" he said., Garcetti cited steps hes taken to spur the citys economy, particularly his promotion of a summer jobs program for young people from low-income families., But he took a go-slow approach to a core item on his economic agenda: a 15-year phase-out of the citys tax on the gross receipts brought in by businesses  a levy that generates about $450 million annually for the city budget. His first budget assumes the first tax cut of $15 million would not occur until 2016., \"Wed be less than honest if we didnt say we were disappointed that the phase-out will not begin during the coming year,\" said Gary Toebben, president and chief executive of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce., Garcetti also declined to back a plan to put a sales tax hike on the November ballot to generate $4.5 billion to fix damaged streets and sidewalks, a source of constant citizen gripes and a crucial part of his back-to-basics program. Garcetti said the city should explore other options, such as tapping the states gas tax or fees companies pay for producing greenhouse gases, before asking voters for more money to tackle a decades-long backlog of roadway upkeep., \"It was pretty clear that this year, putting something on the ballot was probably putting the cart before the horse,\" he said., Garcetti has also been cautious about using his clout to influence local elections, diluting the value of his endorsements. In the race to replace L.A. County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, Garcetti waited until less than a week before the June 3 primary to back West Hollywood Councilman John Duran  too late for the candidate to fully capitalize on the mayors support., \"Its just unfortunate that it came six days before the election and not sooner,\" said Duran, who lost., Garcetti said hes more focused on governing than on politics. \"Im not here to be the political mastermind of Southern California,\" he said. \"Im here to turn the city around.\", On public schools, a signature issue for his predecessor, Garcetti has also taken a low-key approach. Villaraigosa failed in his attempt to take control of the L.A. school system, but nonetheless exerted enormous influence over its leadership and direction., Garcetti, by contrast, has assumed the mayors more traditional role as an outsider on public education. So far, he has declined to weigh in on a special election for a South L.A. school board seat., And he issued no public statement on a judges landmark court ruling striking down Californias teacher tenure laws this month on the grounds that they disproportionately saddle poor and minority children with ineffective teachers  a cause championed by Villaraigosa. It was only in an interview with The Times weeks later that Garcetti, whose campaign was backed by teacher unions, called it \"a great decision.\", Garcetti has taken on some risk by challenging the union that represents most Department of Water and Power employees  a group known for pouring resources into its chosen candidates, including Garcettis opponent in last years election, former City Controller Wendy Greuel. And Garcettis high-profile role in calling for the ouster of Clippers owner Donald Sterling over his racially charged remarks won him wide praise., Garcettis focus on city operations hasnt troubled Hector Huezo, a Boyle Heights resident who heads an alliance of 14 neighborhood councils along the Los Angeles River. Huezo said Garcetti was striking the right balance between big-picture issues  such as restoration of the river  and the \"nitty-gritty\" of improving services like graffiti removal., \"It has been safe,\" Huezo said. \"It has been focused on the internal workings of City Hall.

He has said he is in a listening mode, and doesnt plan to lay out his own foreign policy plans here in Polands capital or at his next stop in Estonia., He met Thursday with Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski and President-elect Andrzej Duda and other political leaders. He and his wife Columba also laid flowers at the Warsaw Uprising Museum, at a cross where Pope John Paul II conducted Mass in 1979, and at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier., Bush seemed to suggest he would endorse a more muscular foreign policy, saying the perception of American retreat from the global stage in recent years had emboldened Russian President Vladimir Putin to commit aggression in Ukraine., When theres doubt, when theres uncertainty, when we pull back, it creates less chance of a more peaceful world, Bush told reporters. Youre seeing the impact of that in Ukraine right now., Russian military forces have been accused of backing pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine, and Putins policies are inciting worries in much of Europe and Washington., Bush again refused to take a position on whether the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should permanently station troops at bases in Poland and the Baltic nations. The alliance has rejected those proposals in the past., But he said the U.S. military should increase its presence in the region. \"I think we need to be more robust,\" he said., Bushs visit has been overshadowed in part by headlines about staff turmoil and other problems in his campaign-in-waiting, and controversy over a 1995 book Bush coauthored that called for a return to public shaming to discourage behavior he considered immoral or improper., \"There was a time when neighbors and communities would frown on out-of-wedlock births and when public condemnation was enough of a stimulus for one to be careful, Bush wrote in \"Profiles in Character.\", Infamous shotgun weddings and Nathaniel Hawthornes Scarlet Letter are reminders that public condemnation of irresponsible sexual behavior has strong historical roots.\", Bush said Thursday that some of his views on shaming have changed since 1995., My views have evolved over time, but my views about the importance of dads being involved in the lives of their children hasnt changed at all, he said., For more political news, follow @LATSeema.]", "Date": "20150611", "Title": "[Jeb Bush says his trip to Europe has confirmed his view of the world]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-jeb-bush-poland-20150611-story.html", "Author": "[Seema Mehta]"}

But recent comments for which Huckabee is being ridiculed could have come from the mouth of the Great Emancipator., Huckabee recently doubled down on his suggestion that states need not comply with a Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide., In an interview with USA Today, he asked: \"Do we really surrender the entire American system of government to five people, unelected, appointed for life, with no consequences for the decisions they make? The founders never intended for there to be such incredible, almost unlimited power, put in the hands of so few people.\", Challenged by Chuck Todd on Meet the Press, Huckabee basically held his ground, though he rejected the idea that he was advocating state nullification of Supreme Court decisions., The courts cant make a law, Huckabee told Todd. They can interpret one, they can invalidate one. But even then, as in the case of theDred Scott decision in 1857, that said black people werent human beings, Abraham Lincoln refused to adhere to that because he said it wasnt a just law., Huckabee is wrong if he thinks that a Supreme Court decision isnt binding on the states or that states could block the implementation of a ruling by refusing to pass enabling legislation. But hes right that Lincoln had a similar view., In his first inaugural address Lincoln said that if the policy of the government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal., But Lincolns limited view of the courts role didnt survive the civil rights revolution of the 20th century. In Cooper vs. Aaron, a 1958 decision involving the desegregation of schools in Little Rock, Ark., the court rejected the notion that there is no duty on state officials to obey federal court orders resting on this courts considered interpretation of the United States Constitution., If the Supreme Court does rule later this year that the Constitution requires that states recognize same-sex marriages, states will have to comply, whatever Huckabee says and whatever Lincoln thought., Follow Michael McGough on Twitter @MichaelMcGough3]", "Date": "20150128", "Title": "[Huckabee and Lincoln agree, and they're both wrong]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-huckabee-lincoln-gaymarriage-20150128-story.html", "Author": "[Michael McGough]"}
{"Content": "[[, Mitch McConnell, the Senates top Republican, has never been closer to snaring the job hes dreamed about for years: majority leader., Let me set the agenda, McConnell told supporters recently at a coal processing plant in this central Kentucky town, using a little football lingo to remind voters that he stands to lead Congress upper chamber if he and the GOP win in Novembers midterm elections. Make me the offensive coordinator., Less than a year after a widely unpopular government shutdown dealt the GOP a political hit, McConnell and his fellow Republicans -- who already hold the majority in the House -- see total control of Congress within their grasp., On Tuesday, McConnell easily dispatched his GOP challenger in the midterm primary. But even as he celebrated victory, there was a growing fear inside the party that the GOP-establishment-versus-tea party battles that have vexed House Speaker John A. Boehner for four years will simply spread to the other side of the Capitol., Much of the Washington gridlock in recent years has come not only from partisan bickering, but from GOP infighting. Deep divisions remain among Republicans about how to address issues such as immigration and the deficit, and such struggles could only intensify with a new Senate majority that includes centrists such as Maines Susan Collins and small-government, libertarian-minded conservatives such as Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul in Kentucky., The success of a Republican Congress would rest largely on McConnell, an veteran lawmaker who worked his way up from being a Capitol intern to serving in President Fords Justice Department, before returning to Kentucky to start his own political career., Fellow Republican and former Majority Leader Trent Lott called McConnell a creature of the Senate, and said the leadership post is one McConnell has long aspired to. He views it as a historic event, and a chance to make a difference, Lott said. I dont think hes just looking for the glory of it., But Lott added thatsucceeding in the role wouldnt just be a test of McConnells skills, its also going to take a different attitude among his troops., That might explain why McConnell, 72, and other Republicans are already working to lower expectations about what is achievable., When youre in the majority, you have more responsibility, McConnell said in a recent interview. And it is challenging., Even a Republican wave this fall would likely give the GOP only a razor-thin majority, perhaps just the 51 votes they would need to end six years of Democratic control of the upper chamber. But thats not enough in a body where any major legislative action requires a filibuster-proof 60 votes., Were not going to have 60 votes, said McConnell, who has developed a reputation as a shrewd political strategist and master of arcane Senate procedure. It is important to remember Barack Obama will still be president for two more years, and the veto pen is a powerful thing. So we need to be realistic., McConnells task would be a daunting one, trying to attract the Democratic votes hell likely need to advance bills without having defections from his own camp. Hard-line conservatives are likely to insist on a renewed fight to repeal the presidents healthcare law and to make spending cuts to balance the budget. Social conservatives would push for new legislation to restrict abortion and benefits to same-sex couples., As majority leader, McConnell would command significant authority in setting the agenda. But in a speech in January he indicated that he would aim to focus on areas of consensus, not solely conservative priorities -- like repeated votes to repeal Obamacare., Theres a time for making a political point, even scoring a few points. I know that as well as anybody, he said then. But it cant be the only thing we do here., Senior lawmakers cite tax reform as an example of the type of legislation that could draw bipartisan support and be harder for Obama to veto., But McConnells stated goal of restoring the Senate to its role as a moderating institution doesnt sit well with tea party conservatives, who have used their position in the House to dominate the agenda, often to the frustration of Boehner., Conservative leaders met quietly outside Washington last week to plot a strategy for reasserting their influence within the Republican Party, concerned that mainstream GOP leaders will abandon core principles and move to the center in order to position the party for the 2016 presidential race., An effort in the next two years to keep our heads down ... will probably end with disappointing election results, warned Michael Needham, who heads the conservative advocacy group Heritage Action for America and attended the strategy meeting., Needham said the party should stick to the conservative ideals that appeal to its core supporters. If youre not providing a contrast to the left, you shouldnt be surprised that the American people embrace the people who are providing the agenda, he said. This notion that the left and the right just need to sit down and come up with compromises does disservice to vast philosophical differences in this country., McConnell allies stress that the Kentuckian isnt planning to shy away from political battles with the president when they are called for. But hes also keenly aware that just as quickly as Republicans might take the Senate majority, they could lose it in 2016 when a slate of first-term GOP lawmakers face reelection in swing and Democratic-leaning states., A fully Republican Congress would have an obligation to the partys would-be 2016 presidential hopeful to avoid extreme positions that would damage GOP presidential chances, analysts say. At the same time, Republicans would bear full responsibility for an institution that is highly unpopular with the public and has been notoriously unproductive in recent years., In order to elect a president in 2016, were going to have to show in 2015 and 16 that the American people can trust Republicans with the government, said Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.). That means that well have to come up with changes that go in a conservative direction, but changes that command support of independent voters as well as our conservative base., McConnells most immediate challenge is winning his own race, which is proving difficult even in a state that handed Obama one of his largest margins of defeat in 2012., After defeating Matt Bevin in the GOP primary Tuesday, McConnell faces a stronger challenge in November from Kentuckys Democratic secretary of state, Alison Lundergan Grimes. On a 50-county bus tour in recent weeks, the 35-year-old Grimes has hammered McConnell for not focusing enough on the states economy.

{"Content": "[[, Mitt Romney, once the presidential nominee Republicans hoped would unseat President Obama, is now nothing more than a Netflix Original, the star of the recent political redemption documentary Mitt., Following Romney from his first family meeting in 2006 to his defeat in November 2012, the 90-minute inside look isnt without its share of expected silliness and self-aggrandizement. There are intimate moments seen at his many homes. Jokes are made about private planes. Romney interrupts an otherwise resonant anecdote to mention his friendship with Papa John, you know, of Papa Johns. In the whole documentary, only two black people are seen speaking on screen. One is the president., Footage of the candidate bumping a hot iron into his arm while mumbling ouch over and over has become an online hit and an apt metaphor for the whole Mitt Romney experience. No doubt: If Mitt were a drinking game for cynical leftists, 47% ABV shots might prove fatal., PHOTOS: How the Democrats can win back the House and keep the Senate -- in 6 steps, But liberal bias confirmation isnt the animating spirit of Mitt. True to the hype, filmmaker Greg Whiteley humanizes Romney, showing the family man in a softer light than the glare of campaign flashbulbs could ever allow the candidate. The result is an if only kind of movie that encourages viewers to look at Romney through a new lens -- not the flipping Mormon of 2008 or the robotic aristocrat of 2012 -- and ask what could have been if wed elected him president instead of Obama., After watching Mitt, it is impossible to doubt that Romney has a profound love for his family, one reflected in their equally charming love for him. It is impossible to doubt -- however gratuitous the endless prayer scenes may be -- that Romneys Mormonism is humble and sincere., Most striking, it is impossible to deny that Romney is a shockingly self-aware man, one far more perceptive of nuance -- in public life, in others, in himself -- than he ever appeared to voters. From Romney summing up the political landscape more shrewdly than most pundits to a sequence in which he honestly interrogates his own privilege relative to his father, one comes away with the unshakable feeling that we as a country underestimated Romneys empathy and curiosity., If provoking that sentiment was the goal here -- and Im guessing it was -- then Ill concede: point proven., But if the larger goal of Mitt was to make viewers regret their harsh judgments, to second-guess the votes they cast, then Whiteleys effort fails. If anything, it underscores for me that the right candidate won in 2012. Thats not in spite of the movies humanizing effort but because of it., This behind-the-scenes look at Romney still does not totally undo the man we saw on the campaign trail. It does not erase the tone-deaf plutocrat whose apparent political instincts would make Michael Dukakis weep. Remember: Romney advocated for the austere Paul Ryan budget, and his position that undocumented immigrants should self-deport was, he explained, a compassionate approach. And he did make those 47% comments., It turns out he was self-aware the whole time? That he knew his limitations? He was able to articulate his own privilege, acknowledging that everything in life was handed to him in a way that makes even his relatively lucky father seem disadvantaged by comparison?, And yet he still ran that campaign?, At least out-of-touch Romney was a victim of his own blindness. Now youre telling us he knew the score, but he just couldnt help himself? That deserves pity, sure, but not if-we-could-go-back votes. Ignorance is one thing, but somebody who cant help their ineptitude despite being able to correctly identify the problem is the last person you want in the White House., Mitt humanizes Romney, but it shows us more clearly than ever why he was not fit to be president. For that, it is valuable., It also reminds us of something deeper. In dispelling our sense of Robot Romney, Heartless Corporate Criminal Mastermind, Mitt shows us that the greatest danger to a more perfect union doesnt come from caricatures of cackling villains. It comes from good men. It comes from family men, the kind who love their wives and kids and dogs. It comes from honest men, who are persuaded of their own intentions, who do not lack in wit or self-awareness, and yet despite all this are so blinded by privilege and corrosive ideology that -- if given power -- they would inflict a brutal austerity upon the body politic, most punishing to the very least among us. Danger comes from human frailty and error., The heroes look just like the villains -- thats the scary part of democratic life. Romney is human. He always was. Thats the lesson Mitt teaches us most clearly., [Update on Jan. 31 at 9:46 p.m.: An earlier version of this post stated that Mitt Romney only spoke to one black person during \"Mitt.\" He in fact speaks to two black people.], ALSO: , Edward Snowdens weasel ways , Another misguided GOP attack on Obamacare, Bristol Palins scathing critique of Wendy Davis is shameful, Emmett Rensin is an author, essayist and political activist in Chicago.

{"Content": "[[, Mitt Romneys announcement that he is pondering a third run for the White House with a focus on fighting income inequality and poverty presents a host of challenges that would appear to be particularly difficult for Romney to surmount., After running in 2008 on his record as Massachusetts governor, and in 2012 as an economic turnaround specialist, Romney will have to convince voters that his new emphasis is heartfelt. That would be a stretch for any candidate, not the least a man already skewered for flip-flopping and viewed by many voters as caring little about the poor., These perceptions were hardened by Romneys own words as he sought the Republican nomination in 2012. At one point, he appeared to dismiss concerns about the \"very poor\" because, he said, they were aided by a safety net that could be repaired if necessary. He was caught on video telling donors that 47% of voters were unavailable to him because they were dependent on the government. After the election, he blamed President Obama giving \"gifts\" to black, Latino and young voters for his loss., Polls taken during the campaign consistently showed that voters believed Romneys policies would benefit the wealthy, not those lower on the economic scale, and he was assaulted by Democratic ads accusing him of boosting businesses without concern for workers., Even some Romney aides found it difficult to explain how his new focus on poverty  one of three principles Romney laid out to Republican leaders Friday night in San Diego, without adding specific policy details  would mesh with his previous messages., \"I dont understand the angle that hes taking,\" said one Romney loyalist, who, like many Republicans interviewed at a party gathering in Coronado last week, would not discuss Romneys strategy by name in order to preserve relations. \"I dont understand why its one of his top three talking points. Im still trying to sort that out on my own.\", Advisors to Romney said that if he runs, he plans to counter criticism of his approach by emphasizing his years as a leader in his Mormon church  work that Romney highlighted Friday. He cited his wife, Ann, as testifying to his intent., \"She knows my heart in a way that few people do,\" Romney said. \"Shes seen me not just as a business guy and a political guy, but for over 10 years, as you know, I served as a pastor for a congregation and for groups of congregations.... Shes seen me work with folks that are looking for better work and jobs and providing care for the sick and the elderly.\", Romney is known as a man of deep faith who has donated generously to his church, but public emphasis on his religious background is new. In 2008, concerned that evangelical voters would be hostile to his Mormonism, Romney rarely spoke of it., Four years later, he was somewhat more open, allowing reporters to accompany him to services, but he did not emphasize his faith. One of the most compelling moments of the 2012 GOP convention featured testimonials from people whom Romney helped when he was a Mormon leader in Massachusetts. But their appearance was scheduled during a part of the gathering that was not televised., One Romney advisor said his reluctance to tout his good works was driven by humility  but acceding to that instinct was a political mistake., Besides having to sell voters on his new approach, Romney faces the additional job of convincing Republicans anxious for a fresh face that the best visage is that of a political veteran and two-time presidential loser., In more than two dozen interviews with party leaders in Coronado and Republicans across the country, little organic groundswell for Romney appeared to be developing., Many said they liked him and believed that the nation would be better off had he been elected president; many were grateful for the role he played as party booster as recently as the November election. Others declined to criticize Romney but said that if he runs, he would compete without any particular advantage against a score of other candidates already vying for support., \"I think Gov. Romney has built up lot of goodwill and earned lot of respect from Republicans across the country,\" said New Hampshire state GOP chairwoman Jennifer Horn. But \"whether its Gov. Romney or anyone else, its a new cycle and theyre going to have to come back and earn every vote, one by one.\", Others, from conservative media pundits to longtime GOP strategists and leaders, were openly caustic., \"I certainly hope that Romney is not our nominee again,\" said Morton Blackwell, a Republican National Committee member from Virginia since 1988. He and his wife contributed $30,000 to efforts backing Romneys 2012 bid. \"Look, having contributed more money to him than any other candidate in my lifetime, I think I have the right to say weve given him his shot.\", Henry Barbour, an influential member of the committee from Mississippi, said Romneys 2012 campaign was both \"a pro and a con\" for 2016, sharpening the candidates political skills but also displaying his weaknesses., \"Should he decide to run, hes going to be competitive and anyone who takes him lightly is a fool. But everybody starts on the go, and thats probably a hard thing if youve already been the nominee,\" Barbour said. \"2012 in many ways for him is his hurdle.\", For some, potential competition from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush complicates loyalty to Romney., Gordon Sondland, a hotelier and real estate investor, was a member of Romneys 2012 national finance committee; he co-chaired multiple Southern California fundraising events for Bush last week. He said he and other former supporters took Romney at his word when he said he would not run again., \"Many of us that have other relationships with other candidates have begun coalescing behind and supporting them.

{"Content": "[[, More than 9 million people nationwide already have voted in the midterm elections that will come to a close next Tuesday, and efforts to analyze the early vote trends have opened a whole new field for political spin., The prime example comes from Florida, a state known for its extremely close elections as well as extensive efforts by both sides to turn out early voters., Both major parties love getting voters to the polls early, which greatly reduces the number of people who need to be canvassed on election day., Voters may like it too. Casting a ballot early generally brings an end to robo-calls and campaign mailers to the voters home, leaving only the constant television commercials as reminders of a particularly nasty and intense campaign., The marquee race in Florida is the contest for governor between the incumbent Gov. Rick Scott (R) and his predecessor, Charlie Crist, a former Republican running as a Democrat., Scott beat his Democratic opponent four years ago by about 61,500 votes out of nearly 5.5 million cast. Polls show the current contest razor-thin., About 2 million Floridians already have cast ballots. Thats more than a third of the total who voted in the 2010 midterm elections., The state allows two methods of early voting  mail-in ballots, which Republicans have tended to dominate in recent elections, and in-person early voting, which tends to bring out Democrats., Both Democrats and Republicans agree on that much. After that the spin begins., Republicans point to the raw vote totals. As of Tuesday morning, according to an analysis by the Miami Herald, registered Republicans casting early ballots outnumbered registered Democrats by 142,787., No one knows for whom those people voted, of course, since the ballots wont be counted until election night. But given partisan patterns, its a fair bet that nearly all voted the party line., Advantage Rick Scott, the Republicans say., Democrats scoff: Republicans in Florida always lead in the initial early vote, they say, pointing to statistics from previous midterm elections, many of which the GOP went on to lose despite leading in the early vote., The real indicator, according to the Democrats, is the shrinking size of the GOPs lead., In an analysis Monday, Steve Schale, the Democratic strategist who helped guide President Obamas two victories in the state, noted that the Republican lead of just over 7% was far below the 17% margin the GOP held at this point in 2010., \"Democratic turnout is definitely better than 2010  and the gap continues to close,\" Schale wrote., All those prognostications should be taken with a grain or two of salt, notes Michael McDonald, associate professor at the University of Florida, whose Elections Project is the countrys leading site for voting statistics., Florida adopted rules in 2012 that allowed people to gain semi-permanent status as absentee voters. That may have changed voting behavior enough to invalidate comparisons with previous elections, McDonald noted in a Twitter message., So to find out who wins this one, Florida voters and the legions of political analysts nationwide may just have to wait until the votes are counted Tuesday night. Or, given Floridas history with close races, maybe even later., For more on politics and policy, follow @DavidLauter on Twitter., ]", "Date": "20141028", "Title": "[9-million-plus votes cast already; statistics create new field for spin]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-early-vote-20141028-story.html", "Author": "[David Lauter]"}
{"Content": "[[, More than a dozen Republicans eyeing the White House gathered here to make their case to hundreds of party activists, drawing out areas of disagreement in the expansive field that will likely emerge as contentious fault lines in the 2016 nominating process., The most potent conflict at thetwo-day conference came in the area of foreign policy, with hawks such as Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Ted Cruz of Texas calling for a muscular posture to defeat Islamic State., \"People taking this stage, telling you to leave them alone, stay away from those people, dont get involved. Well, that wont work, because they are not going to leave you alone,\" Graham said Saturday afternoon at asession in a hotel ballroom. \"They want one thing  they want to destroy your way of life.\", The statement was a thinly veiled criticism of Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has questioned the wisdom of broad U.S. intervention overseas., Earlier in the day, Paul pushed back at the notion that he was an isolationist. , Paul, who is seeking to activate the New Hampshire voters who helped his father, Ron, to a second place finish in the 2012 primary, pledged to \"do everything it takes to defend the country against radical Islam.\" But, he asked, \"Why the hell did we ever go to Libya in the first place?\", \"This is something, if you watch closely, that separates me from other Republicans,\" he said. \"Other Republicans will criticize the president and Hillary Clinton for their foreign policy, but they would have done the same thing 10 times over.\", Graham and Paul spoke on the second day of the Republican Leadership Summit in the state that holds the first presidential primary. Much of their criticism was aimed at policies favored by President Obama and the Democratic presidential front-runner, Hillary Rodham Clinton; they generally steered clear of direct attacks by name on one another., Each candidate spoke and answered audience questions for a half-hour. At times, the gathering had a circus-like air, which became most pronounced with the arrival of businessman and perennial celebrity candidate Donald Trump., After entering the room to the theme song from the television show he hosts, NBCs \"The Apprentice,\" Trump said he could be engaging in more enjoyable pursuits but was considering a presidential run because politicians could not fix the nations problem., \"I know how to bring [the country] back. I wrote a book, The Art of the Deal, said to be the number one selling business book of all time. Great book  Thats why youre here,\" Trump said. \" All the people youre listening to, you can forget it because politicians are all talk, theyre no action.\", Trump and former Hewlett-Packard chief Carly Fiorina were the two potential candidates at the event who have never held elected office. Fiorina, hitting many of the same themes she focused on during her unsuccessful 2010 U.S. Senate run in California, tried to turn the lack of elected experience into a strength., \"While there are many public servants who are fine public servants, the truth is politics is only one experience. I have lots of experiences [and] I have a different perspective because of those experiences,\" she said. \"...Sometimes people who have been inside a system for so long -- they cannot see it for what it is anymore.\", The experience theme rose throughout the gathering, as candidates made arguments that their background, or their generation, was superior., Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker touted his record of cutting taxes and boosting the states economy. And he attributed his success  in a state that votes Democratic in presidential elections  to standing by his convictions., What people want more than anything, they dont just want a fighter. They want someone who fights and wins, he said Saturday night. There are a lot of great fighters out there that dont win. There are a lot of winners out there; they dont fight., Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, for his part, focused his Friday remarks on the depth of experience that a candidate needs in order to serve as president, comments that were taken as a criticism of, among others, Cruz and a senator from his home state, Marco Rubio., I think one of the differences for the presidency than other positions is that someone sitting behind that big desk has to make decisions. You cant just be an empty slate, said Bush, who is expected to run for president but has not yet formally announced his candidacy. He added that Obama was in the U.S. Senate for two years before announcing his presidential bid, and previously in a state legislature with very little record of accomplishment., So I hope Ill be able to share the belief that accomplishment matters and leadership matters, Bush said. Who sits behind the big desk as it relates to the presidency is different than perhaps the United States Senate or another job., Rubio, who announced his presidential bid on Monday, has been in the Senate for a little more thanfour years and was previously a state legislator. (He offered his own gibes against older candidates, a field that would include Bush.) Cruz has been a senator for two years and was previously the Texas solicitor general., Common Core, the set of national education standards viewed by many conservatives as an unwarranted federal intrusion into schools, was another area of disagreement explored during the gathering., Bush strongly supports the standards, and has tried to rebuff criticism by arguing that the standards are voluntary. Several potential rivals, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Texas Cruz, just as strongly disagreed., Cruz, who announced his presidential run in late March, said Common Core is a violation of the 10thAmendment and declared that education is an area \"where the federal government has no business sticking its nose. We need to repeal every word of Common Core!\" (Because states choose to adopt the guidelines, any revocation would have to be done state by state.), Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who said he would announce his presidential plans on May 5, warned against Republicans damaging themselves in a savage primary., \"We can have a free-for-all, fratricide, a demolition derby,\" Huckabee said. \"The result will be we will make the Democrats work easier for them.\", He then pointed to his experience fighting the Clintons in his successful elections in Arkansas., \"I know the Clintons all too well. They play to win, they do anything necessary to win,\" he said. \"I faced them time and time again [and] I lived to tell about it.\", Potential frontrunner or little known, each would-be candidate used the opportunity to try to connect with party activists in a state that successfully selected the last two GOP nominees., Ohio Gov. John Kasich urged the crowd to not commit to other candidates too quickly; he said he was still deciding whether to run., \"Think about me, will you?\" he asked., Twitter: @LATSeema, , , , , , , , , , , , , , 5:44 p.m.: This article was updated with new quotes from Wisconsin Gov.

{"Content": "[[, Most presidential campaigns focus mostly on domestic issues such as the economy, taxes and healthcare, not foreign policy. But the 2016 presidential campaign is already shaping up to be an exception to that rule., For one thing, the world is a mess. The United States is at war in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, even if we dont have combat troops on the ground, and opportunities for new wars keep cropping up. President Obama hasnt convinced most voters that his policies are working; in a Fox News poll released last week, a whopping 73% of respondents said they didnt think Obama had a clear strategy in the fight against the terrorist Islamic State., The likely Democratic candidate, Hillary Rodham Clinton, will need to show how she would do better than the president she served as secretary of State. Her Republican challengers will want to reassert their partys traditional advantage on national security, a phenomenon political scientists call \"issue ownership.\", But Republicans havent quite worked out what their foreign policy ought to be, beyond \"not Obama.\", Thats partly because its still early in the campaign and the GOP boasts a bumper crop of potential candidates, some of them governors who never needed a foreign policy until now., Its also because one probable GOP candidate, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), has already broken from the pack and argued for a minimalist foreign policy with lower defense spending and fewer military commitments. Some of Pauls opponents have charged that his views add up to isolationism; the senator prefers \"conservative realism.\", But the debate isnt only about Paul. Ever since President George W. Bushs long misadventure in Iraq, his Republican successors have been struggling to refashion conservative foreign policy in a way most voters would embrace., \"I dont think the debate exists because Rand Paul is there; Rand Paul is there because the debate exists,\" said Danielle Pletka, a foreign policy scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \"He represents people who are uncomfortable with American global engagement.\", Divisions have emerged over many issues (sanctions in Iran, arms for Ukraine, trade with Cuba) but the crucial question in the campaign will probably be military intervention in the Middle East, the terrain on which the last Republican administration came to grief. If airstrikes alone arent enough to defeat Islamic State, should ground troops be deployed? And should the United States do more to dislodge the government of President Bashar Assad in Syria, including aid to Syrian rebels, airstrikes and ground troops?, Three rough camps among potential Republican candidates can be discerned. There are interventionists, who want the United States to do more. Theres the lone anti-interventionist, Paul. And, in between, theres a big group of straddlers who say they would be tougher than Obama but, when pressed, dont offer much in the way of specifics., The interventionists include Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who has called for more U.S. aid to Syrian rebels. Last week, he dismissed Obamas request for authorization to fight Islamic State as too limited and suggested he would delete Obamas proposed prohibition on long-term ground combat. \"I think we ought to authorize the president to destroy ISIL, period,\" he said, using an acronym for Islamic State., They may also include Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who told ABC News, \"We have to go beyond just aggressive air strikes. We have to be prepared to put boots on the ground, if thats what it takes.\", The straddlers include Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who has demanded that the Obama administration fight its wars more aggressively but has also said he sees no need for U.S. ground troops. Last week, when Obama requested authorization for the air war in Iraq and Syria, Cruz sidestepped the question of limits and said the main defect of Obamas request was that it failed to identify the adversary as \"Islamic terrorists.\", Paul ducked questions last week about Obamas request  perhaps because it came uncomfortably close to a proposal he made last year that prohibited using U.S. troops in ground combat and carried a 12-month expiration date., Democrats were divided over the authorization request, too  perhaps even more deeply than Republicans. But their nomination seems all but settled, and Clinton declined to comment on the issue., Its not unusual for a political party to divide over foreign policy  not even Republicans., \"This debate has been going on for a century,\" Richard Norton Smith, a noted historian of the GOP, told me. \"It isnt snide to suggest that modern libertarians are the heirs of the old isolationists.\" The last time isolationists battled internationalists for the soul of the GOP, it was a very different era  around 1950, at the end of the 20-year-long, five-term Democratic presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman., This time, the debate isnt over how to handle a world transformed by a war the United States and its allies won; its about the legacy of the last Republican president, George W. Bush, and a war most people think we lost. So the potential candidate in the most intriguing position is his brother Jeb, the former governor of Florida. He hasnt spelled out his foreign policy yet, but hes scheduled to give a speech on the subject this week in Chicago. On national security, Jeb Bush is the candidate to watch., doyle.mcmanus@latimes.com, Twitter: @DoyleMcManus, Follow the Opinion section on Twitter@latimesopinionandFacebook]", "Date": "20150213", "Title": "[Republicans haven't quite worked out a foreign policy beyond 'not Obama']", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0215-mcmanus-gop-candidates-foreign-policy-divide-20150215-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, My cartoon was prompted by a report by Times political columnistCathleen Decker about how California has become the place where politicians go to rich peoples homes to talk about the lives of less-fortunate people they rarely meet. In late June, for example: President Obama crossed into Southern California airspace on Thursday and promptly took part in two events with donors, one at the home of producer Chuck Lorre and the second hosted by entertainer Tyler Perry. Later he had dinner with Hollywood moguls Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg., Whats notable is the fact that California, despite its huge number of electoral votes, is no longer in play politically in general elections. The state is widely considered to be a shoo-in for Democratic presidential candidates. But contenders from both parties continue to visit to raise money, which they spend on advertising and other campaign costs in battleground states., Thats why visits by presidential contenders to the Golden State tend to be private affairs rather than public rallies. They fly in, meet with generous donors  or those that they hope will become generous donors  and jet out., Decker quotes Tom Epstein, a former Clinton administration operative and now a vice president at Blue Shield of California: Californias just different. Its a money machine now, more than anything else., You know somethings wrong with democracy when the nations most populous state has become politically irrelevant other than as a source of donor cash. And something is doubly wrong when it is possible for candidates to visit a state with relatively high unemployment and only meet with those willing to drop big bundles of money. Having attended some of these functions, and having befriended a number of waiters who work them, I have always been interested in the cultural intersection of the wealthy, privileged personalities at the catered events and the working-class people serving them drinks and crudits., This is not something that the politicians, even the supposedly liberal ones, seem to care much about. But maybe they should. Remember Mitt Romneys 47%\" comment, the one about a nation of takers that may have done more than anything else to derail his chances to become president in 2012?, It was captured on video by a bartender who worked for the catering company for the event. It was not the first time the bartender met Romney though it seems unlikely that Romney could have recalled their previous meeting., That time, told that Romney drank Diet Coke with lemon, the bartender handed him one without being asked at a previous event. Romney didnt say a word, didnt acknowledge the guys existence., He took it and turned and didnt say anything,\" the bartender explained. \"I presented him the exact right drink that he wanted ... Had it there, sitting there on a napkin. He took it out of my hand and turned his back without a thank you or anything else., As a Mormon, Romney may never have been taught the essential importance of always being nice to your bartender. But it appears to have cost him dearly. As Hillary Rodham Clinton, Jeb Bush and other top contenders for 2016 make the rounds at highfalutin events in California, one assumes that they remember what happened to Romney., Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinionandFacebook]", "Date": "20150630", "Title": "[Hey politicians: California is more than just a money bag for your 2016 campaign]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-rall-0630-california-hillary-2016-20150629-story.html", "Author": "[Ted Rall ]"}
{"Content": "[[, Negotiators from Taiwan and China met Saturday in an effort to maintain momentum for better relations that have resulted in economic gains., The ministers, appearing keen to sustain seven years of closer ties, discussed privately topics such as tourism and the dredging of sand in their shared ocean strait, officials said., But there were no signs that they touched directly on sensitive issues concerning Taiwans 2016 presidential election. Taiwans chief opposition Democratic Progressive Party, whose nominee leads in early public opinion polls, advocates a more cautious approach to China, including no new dialogue without greater respect for the islands self-rule., The 2016 elections are the elephant in the room, said Sean King, senior vice president with the consultancy Park Strategies in New York and Taipei., China has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan since the Chinese civil war of the 1940s, when Chiang Kai-sheks Nationalists formed a rival government on the island as Mao Tse Tungs Communists consolidated control over the mainland. Mao and his successors long threatened to use force if the self-ruled island decalred de jure independence., Current Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou, who must step down next year due to term limits, has led his government to ease icy relations by setting aside political differences to pursue economic cooperation., The Nationalists have agreed to talk to Beijing as part of one country, though their interpretation of China differs from that of Beijing. The opposition opposes that basis for dialogue., Relations with China suddenly slowed last year when tens of thousands protested in Taipei over what they view as a lack of transparency in deal-making. Critics also have expressed fear that China would leverage agreements with Taiwan in order to eventually take control of the island. That backlash eroded the ruling partys approval ratings., Taiwans minister to Saturdays talks had little power to discuss relations with China after Ma leaves office, said Alan Romberg, East Asia Program director with the Stimson Institute, a think tank in Washington. The two sides signed no agreements., His position is already clearly laid out by the president, Romberg said., The two-hour meeting on the tiny Taiwan-controlled Kinmen islets just off the mainland followed a series of speeches by the president in Taipei supporting continued warm relations with China., In the future we shouldlook correctly at reality, set aside disputes, promote cross-Strait relations in a stable manner and produce results that more ordinary people can feel, said Taiwans minister, Andrew Hsia, of the governmental China policymaking body Mainland Affairs Council, in opening remarks Saturday., Ma wants Taiwan to join Chinas multi-country Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in order to play a bigger role in regional affairs. He is pushing separately for the two sides to set up their first-ever consular-style offices to facilitate tourism and investment., The Chinese side said Saturday it welcomed Taiwan to join the bank and both sides agreed to talk further at an early date about the representative offices., Pacts with China under Ma have created 9,600 jobs and last year raised two-way trade to a record $130 billion, officials say. Chinese tourism accounted for $13 billion in revenue from 2008 to 2014, Ma said in a speech May 20., But critics say that economic gains have helped only wealthy business people. Some say the growing numbers of Chinese tourists, about 10 million since 2008, cause traffic jams, shout in public and bargain too forcefully with merchants over small items., At a beach in the southern city Kaohsiung, activists mounted a fake cannon last month to protest congestion by tour buses and the litter left behind. On Saturday, about 300 opponents as well as supporters of Taiwan-China dialogue demonstrated outside the meeting, with one protester injured in a scuffle., Jennings is a special correspondent., , ]", "Date": "20150523", "Title": "[China, Taiwan meet to promote solid relations, economic gains]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-china-taiwan-meet-to-promote-solid-relations-economic-gains-20150523-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, Neither was in the audience but Jeb Bush jokingly alluded to both, drawing appreciative laughs by noting he met his first president the day he was born and the second the day he came home from the hospital., Then Bush, formally announcing his run for the White House, turned serious, making his point humbly and unmistakably clear: The presidency, he said, was something to be earned, not inherited., Not a one of us deserves the job, the former Florida governor told a hometown crowd Monday, by right of resume, party, seniority, family or family narrative., Its nobodys turn, Bush went on, in what served as well as a poke at the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Rodham Clinton. Its everybodys test, and its wide open  exactly as a contest for president should be., The question of dynastic succession for Bush, the son of former President George H.W. Bush and the younger brother of former President George W. Bush, is one of the largest hurdles facing him in his historic White House bid., But beyond that, Bushs candidacy represents a gamble. More than most others in the field, Bush has been willing to challenge party orthodoxy, chiefly in his call for a comprehensive overhaul of the nations immigration laws  eschewing the enforcement-driven approach favored by many in the Republican Party  and continued support for federal education standards that are anathema to many conservatives., The bet is that Bush can begin to stake positions with appeal to a broader electorate in November 2016, especially the rapidly growing share of Latino voters, without destroying his chances of first winning his partys nomination., Although his official launch was a mere formality after six months of unfettered campaigning, it served as a fresh start of sorts for a candidacy that has proved less than overwhelming. The event, attended by his mother, former First Lady Barbara Bush, and his wife, children and other family members, drew hours of television coverage and dozens of reporters to swampy south Florida., The atmospherics, as much as Bushs message  upbeat, accomplished and distinct from dysfunctional Washington  were very much intended to signal that, even at age 62, he is poised to be a different sort of Republican., From the Latin music pulsing outside to the mingling of Spanish and other languages inside a community college gymnasium, Bushs rally was no typical gathering of the aging, white, rural GOP., The chosen venue, Miami Dade College, was itself a signal, telegraphing Bushs hope to reach beyond what has been his partys shrinking political base. A branch of the state public university system, the palm-dotted suburban Miami campus has one of the largest enrollments of Latino students in the country., Inside the heavily air-conditioned gym, Bush delivered the message he hopes will serve him through the long, grinding campaign, mixing can-do confidence and a highly laudatory recitation of his record as governor with subtle jabs at the several senators competing with him for the GOP nomination., Aiming at President Obama and swatting his congressional rivals in turn, Bush suggested the record of the incumbent administration showed that executive experience is another term for preparation, and there is no substitute for that., Yet for all the newness he sought to project and despite the large contingent of young people in the audience, much of Bushs message was old-time Republican gospel, including calls for lower taxes, less regulation and more limited government. His promise to banish the special interests and shake up the culture of Washington is standard for candidates of both parties., In one of Mondays few specific pledges, Bush staked an ambitious goal of 4% annual growth for each year he is president, creating a cumulative 19 million jobs, though he did not say whether that impressive number would be created in a single term or require two., Bush, who started in Florida politics in the early 1980s helping build the state Republican Party, had been mentioned as a presidential prospect for years. Still, he surprised many in December when he finally expressed interest in running., Perhaps more surprising, though, has been his performance since., Far from the commanding front-runner some anticipated  or his brother proved when he ran in 2000  Bush has failed to break free of a large and growing field of GOP rivals, by far the biggest in recent memory. More than a dozen hopefuls have declared their candidacy or are weighing a White House bid., Bushs emergence did help dissuade Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, from making a third try for president. Otherwise Bush and his formidable money-raising machine have proved considerably less than intimidating., Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who will probably vie with Bush for the support of establishment and less ideologically conservative Republicans, has indicated he plans to enter the race by the end of summer. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, another competitor for anti-Washington, establishment GOP support, is expected to officially announce his candidacy in coming weeks., Even Marco Rubio, Floridas junior senator, declined to stand aside for Bush, who helped mentor Rubio early in his political career. (The two exchanged friendly Twitter messages Monday before Bushs rally.), Time has not done him any favors., The Republican Party has moved considerably to the right since Bush last ran for office more than a dozen years ago. And his political rustiness has shown, most notably when he bobbled an easily foreseen question about whether he backed the unpopular war his brother launched in Iraq. Bush finally said, given what is known today, he would not have supported the invasion., In a sign of concern, Bush last week replaced his campaign manager, shifting him from day-to-day operations to a position focused on winning the earliest-voting states., Change, especially in politics, is never easy., At one point Monday, Bush was interrupted by demonstrators who stood up and revealed T-shirts spelling out Legal status is not enough  a reflection of unhappiness with Bush because he backed away from advocating a path to citizenship for the millions of immigrants in the country illegally., Turning to address his critics, Bush vowed to pass meaningful immigration reform, though he offered no specifics., To win the presidency, Bush suggested he would seek to bring the Republican Party to his way of thinking, not the other way around.

{"Content": "[[, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has had a tough winter, and its not getting any better with a new poll showing his favorability dropping sharply in his home state., Christie, who hopes to get his partys presidential nomination, wins a favorable view from only 37% of registered New Jersey voters in the latest survey from Rutgers Universitys Eagleton Institute of Politics, one of the states leading polls. Thats a seven-point drop in two months. For the first time, a majority in the Rutgers-Eagleton survey, 53%, viewed him negatively., Although the GOP nomination race has no official candidates yet, it has plenty of competition. This is the season in which presidential hopefuls try to win over important party activists, major donors and experienced staff, all of which are crucial to putting together a successful run. In that invisible primary, weakness at home can become a major liability., Christie has a lot of problems beyond poll numbers. He has a difficult fight ahead with Democratic legislators over the state budget. Investigations into the role that his appointees played in blocking traffic on the George Washington Bridge appear to have widened into other alleged wrongdoing. And a recent trip to London generated unfavorable headlines over Christies remarks about vaccinations., But the more immediate political problem, which the home state disapproval could worsen, is the widespread perception that Christies outspoken personality doesnt wear well with voters., Just over a year ago, Christie was still at the top of the field of potential GOP presidential candidates. Then, in January 2014, the scandal over the bridge became a major national story. As Christies appointees were accused of orchestrating the traffic tie-ups as a form of political retribution, his popularity began to sink. The drop hasnt stopped., No one has come up with proof that Christie was personally involved in the bridge closure, but the continuing investigations have combined with other voter doubts to harm him at home and in states that hold key early primaries., A recent Des Moines Register poll in Iowa, for example, showed just 36% of likely voters in that states Republican caucuses had a favorable impression of Christie. By a significant margin, that was the lowest standing of any of the major potential candidates. Similar findings have come from other state and national surveys., As Amy Walter of the nonpartisanCook Political Report noted a month ago, \"poll after poll shows that the GOP base isnt ambivalent about New Jerseys governor - they simply dont like him.\", A few numbers stand out in the latest New Jersey survey. Christies overall drop in the poll appears to be driven by self-described independents souring on him in large numbers. Christie carried independent voters handily in both of his elections as governor, but now, the share giving him a favorable rating has dropped to 31%, down 16 points since December., Part of the rationale for Christies candidacy has been the argument that his victories in New Jersey show he can broaden the partys appeal beyond core Republican voters. His decline among independents challenges that., And while the George Washington bridge scandal continues to take a toll, its not Christies biggest problem. Asked to say in their own words why they thought Christies standing had declined, 15% cited the bridge scandal. But one-fifth of the voters surveyed mentioned something more fundamental -- Christies overall personality or attitude., For more on politics and policy, follow @DavidLauter on Twitter.]", "Date": "20150213", "Title": "[Tough winter for Chris Christie as his home-state standing drops]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-christie-poll-20150213-story.html", "Author": "[David Lauter]"}

Chris Christie, saying that the American people have the appetite for hard truths, called Tuesday for cutting Social Security benefits and raising Medicare premiums for future upper-income retirees and raising the retirement age., Although several other Republicans with presidential ambitions have called for changes in the nations giant retirement benefits programs, Christies proposals are more detailed and more likely to generate controversy., His plan would go considerably further, for example, than proposals made in 2010 and 2011 by Rep.

Although budget hawks continue to warn about the long-term costs of the governments huge retirement programs, the GOP has become increasingly dependent on the votes of older Americans., Roughly half the voters in many GOP primaries in 2012 were 60 or older, according to exit polls., Some Democrats, meanwhile, have begun calling for increases in Social Security checks, particularly for lower-income beneficiaries., In addition to cuts in Social Security and Medicare, Christie also called for giving states more control over Medicaid, the joint federal-state health program for the poor, and for requiring the poor to pay some amount out-of-pocket for their care., He also proposed changes to the Social Security disability program that would limit access to benefits for some people., The proposals, delivered in a speech in New Hampshire, came as Christies presidential hopes have faded. Though he once enjoyed a position atop the potential GOP field, he has languished for the last year as rivals have gained attention., Christies allies have said that he hopes calls for changing popular entitlement programs, such as Social Security, will bolster his image as a truth-teller, unafraid to take bold stands., Some in both political parties will criticize these ideas, Christie said in his speech. Some will surrender to the divisiveness, the fear-mongering and the scare tactics that are generously served on the political menu in Washington, D.C., every day., These are the truths you all know in your gut -- I want to give voice to those common sense truths you already know, he said. I will not pander. I will not flip flop. I am not afraid to tell you the truth as I see it., Without significant changes, Social Security and Medicare will be bankrupt and insolvent by the time you retire, he said to the students in his audience at Saint Anselm College in Manchester., Thats a hotly debated forecast. Projections of the future cost of retirement programs depend a lot on assumptions about inflation, economic growth and, in the case of Medicare, the cost of medical care., In the last several years, medical costs have risen much less than projected, leading the Congressional Budget Office to lower its long-term forecasts of Medicares costs., And projections of Social Securitys long-term finances cover a wide range of possibilities; Christie emphasized the most dire scenarios., If adopted, Christies proposals would significantly reshape Social Security, in particular, changing it from a program that provides benefits for all retirees to one that levies taxes on all workers, but gives benefits primarily to middle- and lower-income retirees., Under his plan, benefits would be reduced for seniors with non-Social Security income of more than $80,000 and eliminated entirely for those with non-Social Security income of more than $200,000. Doing so would affect about 2% of retirees, he said., That idea, known as means testing, has been pushed for many years by those concerned about Social Securitys costs., Christie described the change as a matter of fairness, saying that Social Security exists to ensure that seniors will not grow old in back-breaking poverty, but that those who dont need the help, shouldnt get it., Do we really believe that the wealthiest Americans need to take from younger, hard-working Americans to receive what, for most of them, is a modest monthly Social Security check? he asked., Supporters of the current program have long argued that eliminating universal benefits would erode support for Social Security., Christie said that his proposals would not affect any current retirees or those close to retirement age, but his speech did not specify when the changes should take effect. A spokesman did not respond to a question on that point., For Medicare, Christie proposed a similar change, raising premiums for those with incomes above $85,000. Currently, seniors with incomes at that level pay Medicare Part B premiums equivalent to 25% of the cost of their medical insurance., Christie would raise that to 40%, with the amount increasing to 90% of the full cost for those with incomes above $196,000 per year., He would adopt an equivalent increase for Medicares prescription drug coverage., Christie also proposed increasing the retirement age. Starting in 2022, he would raise the age by two months each year until it hits 69., He would raise the Medicare eligibility age at a similar pace so that it would reach 67 in 2040 and 69 in 2064. He would also eliminate payroll taxes on wages earned by people older than 62., And he proposed switching how the government calculates inflation for determining cost-of-living increases, a proposal that President Obama has backed that would have the effect of reducing the growth of benefits over time., Like Obama, he would increase benefits for seniors 85 or older to offset the reduction in cost-of-living adjustments., Not surprisingly, Christies proposal drew immediate criticism from backers of the current program., Gov. Chris Christie today went after not only seniors earned Social Security benefits, but also their health coverage, in an attempt to further his own presidential ambitions, the Alliance for Retired Americans, a labor-backed group, said in a statement., Raising the Social Security age to 69, means-testing it and eliminating benefits for some is a way to get ones toe under the tent in order to destroy Social Security piece by piece., For more on politics and policy, follow@DavidLauter on Twitter.]", "Date": "20150414", "Title": "[Christie calls for cuts in Social Security, Medicare]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-christie-social-security-20150414-story.html", "Author": "[David Lauter]"}
{"Content": "[[, New research out Friday shows that Republicans will need a larger slice of Latino voters than previously thought if they hope to win the White House in 2016, creating an even tougher hurdle for the eventual nominee., Thanks to changing demographics, the conventional math that once said the GOP would need to win a minimum of 40% of the Latino electorate no longer holds., Now, data suggests that Republicans will need as much as 47% of Latino voters -- nearly twice the share that Mitt Romney is believed to have captured in 2012., Put another way: 47% is the new 40%. And it is a daunting number., \"Its very, very, very basic: Every single year, you need a little bit more of the Latino vote,\" said Matt Barreto, UCLA political science professor and co-founder of the polling firm Latino Decisions. \"Its just math.\", The research is based on demographic changes and voter preferences emerging at a time when older, white voters who have powered Republican nominees are fading. The growing Latino electorate is expected to surpass 10% of all voters in 2016, and younger white voters are trending toward Democrats., The findings arelikely to scramble Republican strategy circles, because the top Republican candidates are currently performing no better than Romney among Latinos -- a problem compounded by celebrity candidate Donald Trumps disparaging comments about Mexican immigrants., Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, does best with Latinos, at 27%, according to a Univision poll this week, closely trailed by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) at 25%., The new thinking unveiled Friday largely mirrors that of Republican pollster Whit Ayres, who has argued that the partys 2016 nominee will need more than 40% of the Latino vote. He has been tapped by Rubios campaign., A look at past elections shows the rough road ahead for the GOP amid the demographic shift., The last Republican nominee to hit the 40% threshold was George W. Bush in 2004, who was popular with Latino voters. He went on to win the White House with 58% of the white vote, at a time when Latinos were 7% of overall voters., Romney and John McCain trailed in Latino support and lost the presidency., Republicans could stem their reliance on Latino voters if the partys nominee performed better among whites -- as some GOP strategists are hoping to do., But that strategy could force thecandidate to favor more conservative positions on immigration and other issues for little gain, as history also shows that the partys attempt to grow its support among white voters has its limits., The partys high-water mark with white voters came when Ronald Reagan won 66% of the white electorate in the 1984 landslide., By 2012, Romney won 59% of white voters against President Obama., If the GOP nominee won 60% of the white electorate in 2016, the candidate would need 42% of the Latino vote to win the White House, the research shows., But if the candidate again topped out at 59% of white voters in 2016, he or she would need 47% of the Latino vote to make up the difference, the research said., Barreto, who conducted the research for Americas Voice, a leading immigration advocacy group, acknowledged he had been using the old thinking until he ran the numbers., \"We were blind to this,\" he said at a briefing Friday in Washington. \"We shouldnt use the 40% anymore.\", For the latest from Congress and the 2016 campaign follow @LisaMascaro]", "Date": "20150717", "Title": "[New data suggest GOP 2016 nominee will need to win nearly half of Latino vote]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-latino-gop-20150717-story.html", "Author": "[Lisa Mascaro]"}
{"Content": "[[, Newport Beach businessman Dale Dykema is a highly sought-after guest when potential Republican presidential candidates visit California., He recently attended an intimate dinner with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a cocktail party headlined by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and a half-hour tete-a-tete with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie., In the last quarter of a century, Dykema, 85, has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to GOP candidates, party organizations and political action committees. He has yet to make up his mind on whom to back  and more importantly, whom to raise money for  in the 2016 presidential campaign., \"There are just so many candidates in the race. Im completely on the fence,\" said Dykema, founder of TD Service Financial Corp., a company that provides foreclosure services for the mortgage industry. In 2012, he said, he settled quickly on former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, but for the upcoming election he may wait until after the first couple of primaries before deciding., The size of the field  well over a dozen likely candidates  coupled with the lack of a clear favorite mean many Republican donors in California share Dykemas reluctance to commit., \"Normally, theres a candidate that the entire establishment is behind and theres this huge fundraising juggernaut for one person,\" said Jon Fleischman, a state GOP official from Anaheim Hills and publisher of an influential conservative blog. \"This year, no one has the brass ring already in hand. Were seeing a lot more listening and a lot less giving early.\", On the Democratic side, state donors are already uniting behind former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the partys overwhelming favorite. She raised millions for her nascent campaign at events hosted earlier this month by entertainment and business leaders., As Republican donors weigh their choices, theyre grilling the 2016 candidates on a range of issues, including immigration, religious freedom and net neutrality. Theyre doing so in homes in Bel-Air, boardrooms in the Silicon Valley, parties in Orange County and GOP functions all over the state  a nod to Californias primacy in what is known in political circles as the \"invisible primary.\", California probably doesnt matter in the nominating fight. Its June 7, 2016, presidential primary is almost certainly too late to affect the GOPs process. The state is also too Democratic to put it in play in next years general election. But California is the biggest source of campaign cash in the nation., In the 2012 election, presidential candidates directly raised more than $112 million from Californias deep-pocketed donors. Thats almost the combined total raised in the next two most-generous states, Texas and New York, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. These figures do not include the millions donated to party committees and outside groups such as \"super PACs\" that are not controlled by a candidate., Not surprisingly, given Californias tilt toward Democrats, President Obama was the biggest beneficiary then, raising $62.8 million here for his reelection bid, according to the center. But GOP candidates also filled their campaign coffers here  Romney collected $41.3 million, and the rest of the Republican field raised nearly $8 million., Romneys extensive fundraising network in California, which he cultivated over nearly a decade, became available to others when he decided in January not to run again., \"Were talking a lot about it, but no ones committing to anyone right now,\" said Bret de St. Jeor, a Modesto businessman and Romney fundraiser in 2012. \"Its just flat-out too early. Lets hear a little bit more. Lets hear the opening statements from the other candidates before we start jumping on somebodys bandwagon.\", Donors \"love the courting process,\" said Shawn Steel, a Republican National Committee member from Surfside in Orange County. \"Most of the serious candidates are coming to California repeatedly, and their mission is to establish a rapport as early as possible  and to try to meet as many folks as possible.\", Steel, who is undecided, recently co-hosted a meet-and-greet and intimate dinner for Walker at the tony Pacific Club in Newport Beach. He noted that the field includes multiple candidates who appeal to the same GOP faction, whether its establishment voters, social conservatives or tea party groups., Many potential candidates, he added, have connections to California, or have the opportunity to grow support., Former Hewlett-Packard Chief Executive Carly Fiorina retains backers from her unsuccessful run against Sen. Barbara Boxer in 2010, Steel said. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry developed ties to the state during his unsuccessful 2012 presidential bid, in part because one of his top strategists is a longtime and well-respected California GOP fundraiser., Walker is a familiar face in Californias donor community, as he is across the nation, because of his fierce fight against unions in Wisconsin. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul has spent considerable time wooing the libertarian streak that runs through Silicon Valley. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has blown away audiences with his oratory, Steel said. And Bushs family has long-standing alliances in the state., Jeb Bushs brother, former President George W. Bush, was a prodigious fundraiser here, performing a \"cash-ectomy on the California donor community\" whenever he visited, Fleischman said. \"It was staggering.\", Those relationships havent sealed the deal for Jeb Bush here, but they do provide an edge for the yet-undeclared candidate that was visible during a recent, lucrative fundraising swing through the state., \"I really wanted to see him run before his brother ran,\" said venture capitalist William H. Draper III, who went to Yale with their father, President George H.W. Bush, and served as his finance chair in his unsuccessful 1980 presidential run., Draper, a former president of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, co-hosted an East Palo Alto fundraiser for Jeb Bushs committee., Susan McCaw, a major fundraiser for George W. Bush who served as his ambassador to Austria, said she was impressed by Jeb Bushs record as governor of Florida and his support for education and immigration reform. She and her husband held a fundraiser for his political action committee at their Bel-Air home., \"I think he has the best chance of beating Hillary in the general,\" she said., Electability was the one quality nearly every donor  committed or not  mentioned as a priority., John Jordan, a tech entrepreneur and vintner who has spent millions on Republican causes, plans to make a decision over the summer. He is hosting a dinner for Walker at his Healdsburg vineyard and expects to huddle with Paul soon. His sole focus, he said, is backing the candidate who could win the White House in 2016 by attracting the various factions of GOP voters as well as less ideologically driven general-election voters., \"In a pretty cold-blooded way,\" Jordan said, \"it has got to be someone that can unite the base, that they will like enough to turn out for  but at the same time isnt someone thats obnoxious.\", seema.mehta@latimes.com, Twitter: @LATSeema]", "Date": "20150517", "Title": "[California donors wait for a favorite to emerge from big GOP presidential field]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-gop-fundraising-20150517-story.html", "Author": "[Seema Mehta]"}
{"Content": "[[, Nike Chairman Phil Knight, who turned a business selling shoes out of the back of his car into the worlds most valuable sports brand, has announced plans to step down as company chairman., Knight, 77, was a middle distance runner in college who began the company in a handshake deal with Oregon coach Bill Bowerman in 1964, with each putting up $500. With shrewd marketing campaigns built around celebrity endorsers like Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods, he made the swoosh one of the most recognizable logos around the globe., That phenomenal growth also landed Knight on Forbes magazines list of 50 richest people in the world, with a net worth estimated at $24 billion., \"For me, Nike has always been more than just a company  it has been my lifes passion,\" Knight said in a statement., Knight said he wants Nike President and CEO Mark Parker, who has held those positions since 2006, to succeed him. No specific date was set for Knights departure, though he said he plans to stay involved in the business. Nike Inc. said it expects to name a new chairman in 2016., Knight sold his first pairs of shoes out of an old Plymouth Valiant while traveling the same Pacific Northwest track circuit on which he once competed. The company was originally named Blue Ribbon Sports, but changed in 1978 to Nike  the winged goddess of victory in Greek mythology  on the advice of a friend., Knight said at the time, \"I dont love it, but it will grow on me.\", By 1969, Knight was making enough selling shoes to quit his full-time job as an accountant and devote himself to the footwear company. Two years later, he paid $35 to Carolyn Davidson for the original swoosh logo design now plastered across the uniforms and shoes of athletes from the World Cup to little leagues. Building the brand through shrewd advertising campaigns and top-flight celebrity athlete endorsers like Jordan and Woods, he turned the company into what Forbes called the \"most valuable sports brand in the world.\", Knight also says he will transfer most of his Nike stock to a limited liability company called Swoosh LLC. The directors of the company will be Knight himself, Parker, and Nike directors Alan Graf and John Donahoe. On Tuesday, Knight said he had transferred 128.5 million shares, or about 15 percent of Nikes total outstanding shares, to Swoosh. Because Knight owns a large amount of Nikes Class A shares, which arent publicly traded, Swoosh now has the power to elect three-quarters of Nikes board., Knight says the move will help keep Nikes corporate governance strong., As of a year ago, Knight owned about 75 percent of Nikes Class A shares and a fraction of a percent of its Class B shares. The Class B shares are currently trading around all-time highs and closed at $108.02 on Tuesday., On Thursday, Nike said its annual profit grew 22 percent to $3.27 billion and its revenue rose 10 percent to $30.6 billion., The Beaverton, Oregon-based company also named Knights son Travis to a spot on the board Tuesday. Travis Knight, 41, is the CEO of animation studio Laika LLC and was producer and lead animator on the movies \"ParaNorman\" and The Boxtrolls, , This story has been corrected to show Knights age is 77, not 76 and that Bowermans first name was Bill, not Bob.]", "Date": "20150701", "Title": "[Nike co-founder Knight will step down as chairman]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-nike-phil-knight-20150701-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}

Ginsburg said the Voting Rights Act of 1965 had \"worked to safeguard long-obstructed access to the ballot by African Americans\" by blocking such election-law changes in the South. But the court voided that \"pre-clearance\" rule\" last year in a 5-4 decision., North Carolinas GOP-controlled Legislature had adopted a series of changes to the election rules, but until Wednesday it was unclear whether they would take effect this fall., On Oct. 1, a federal appeals court had objected to changes involving same-day registration and out-of-precinct voting. The two judges in the majority, both appointees of President Obama, said the new rules could not be enforced in this election because they were likely to have a harsher effect on black voters., North Carolinas attorneys filed an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court, saying the appellate ruling was \"deeply flawed\" and would cause \"even more confusion.\", In the conflicting appeals, both sides accused the other of trying to change the rules on the eve of an election., The high court set aside the appellate courts decision., The North Carolina law also will require voters to show a photo identification at the polls, but that provision will not take effect until 2016., Two weeks ago, the high court issued a similar order for Ohio, clearing the way for the state to reduce the time for early voting from 35 days to 28., North Carolina Gov.

{"Content": "[[, Not many people can prompt New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to apologize for his word choices or get former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to distance himself from a family loyalist., But Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate, has done both., The octogenarians power is in his money  and a demonstrated willingness to spend it freely to make or break political campaigns. He is among a growing, but still elite, group of very-big-dollar donors who can spend enough to keep an entire presidential campaign viable, even in the face of voter rejection., Competition for the high rollers is so fierce among this years unusually large Republican field that it has created a race within the race: the wealthy donors primary, a model that has eclipsed the traditional presidential campaign structure. Now, presidential hopefuls vie for the backing of millionaires and billionaires long before a primary vote is cast  and that money and support will empower them to stay in the race more deeply into primary season, perhaps right up to the national conventions., Theres the Adelson Primary  not to be confused with the so-called Koch Brothers Primary, the Norman Braman Caucus or the Larry Ellison Event, named for the industrialist brothers, the South Florida car dealer and the tech entrepreneur, respectively, each of whom have all but guaranteed big payoffs to one or more candidates., The race for the billionaires  its changed everything, said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who announced his own presidential bid last week in a still-growing field., In previous presidential campaigns, before the age of the mega-donor, money tended to track results, said Tom Rath, a longtime Republican strategist in the early primary state of New Hampshire. A victory or a strong showing in an early primary or caucus would indicate legitimacy, drawing donors and media attention, he said., Then, in 2012, Adelson spent $15 million through a super PAC to keep former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in the race for the Republican nomination for president long after other backers and voters had moved on. Such political patronage was novel then, as the implications of rapidly weakened enforcement of campaign finance rules were still being explored., Now big-money backers are almost required for political survival. This year nearly every candidate in the GOP field, which could exceed 20 people, is seeking a patron. And they have shown little shame in groveling., Send some my way! said Graham, only partly in jest. For his own long-shot bid, Graham drew the backing of billionaire investor Ronald Perelman., Candidates have been regularly parading in front of Adelson, often at forums hosted for a small group of like-minded donors at one of his Vegas resorts., Christie apologized to Adelson after referring during one of those meetings to the occupied territories  a commonly used reference to the West Bank and East Jerusalem, but one that conservative supporters of Israel like Adelson abhor., Likewise, Jeb Bush moved to distance himself from a longtime family friend, former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu., Adelson has yet to pick a candidate this year. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) won positive reviews from attendees at one of the events, according to those familiar with the gathering, though others say Adelson has been eyeing Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida., That would be a coup for Rubio, who already has the backing of Braman, a longtime supporter who has indicated he is likely to spend millions., Im committed to provide very substantial support, Braman, the former Philadelphia Eagles owner, said in an interview days before Rubio announced his candidacy. Braman has been close to Rubio for years and hired the senators wife, Jeanette, to handle his familys charitable giving., Backers of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who has yet to sign up a mega-donor, are hopeful his recent filibuster-like attempt to shut down government surveillance operations will land him a billionaire., He shouldnt have much trouble., The one thing I can tell you is there are more billionaires than you think, Graham said. Still, he believes no candidate can win the nomination without shaking the hands of voters and attending house parties in the early primary states., Foster Friess, a conservative businessman, spent more than $2 million to help keep the threadbare campaign of former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) afloat and has said he will contribute again but at a lower profile., I have decided to keep the amount of my political giving to myself. Im sure folks can find it out, somehow, but Im going to be a little more circumspect this go-round, Friess said by email., Is it fair or not for big donors to be giving so much? Does it create some kind of inherent unfairness? he went on. I guess Id have to ask, is it fair to put limits on how people spend their money? We are supposed to be a free country, but as I open the paper each day, I see more and more of our freedoms eroding., For Democrats, big donors include California environmental activist Tom Steyer, who spent $69.2 million on the 2014 midterm elections and is spending money in early primary states ahead of 2016. But the dominance of Hillary Rodham Clinton in the polls will mean Steyer and other liberals are less likely to influence the primary contest., The power to bring relevance to candidates or push them into the top tier gives big GOP donors unrivaled clout., You have a sense of, shall we say, a certain amount of debt, obligation, to one or two or three people who are your reason why you existed, said Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee who also co-wrote the campaign finance rules that have since been gutted by court decisions., McCain, like many Republicans, blames President Obamas rejection of public matching money in 2008  when he seriously outspent McCain on his way to defeating him  for unleashing much of the flood of money. But it was court decisions and the 2012 election that showed the potential for big donors to spend unlimited dollars and blunt early primary results., Witness Iowa, where Republicans long risked near banishment from the state if they failed to support a federal requirement to use corn-based ethanol and other renewable fuels in gasoline  a boost to the states farm economy., No more. Charles and David Koch, the energy billionaires who have become the leading donors in Republican politics, oppose the requirement, calling it unwarranted government intrusion in the free market., Bush said in March that he wants to phase it out. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has hedged his position, saying he might do the same. Cruz has sponsored a bill to eliminate it., Those three candidates, along with Rubio and Paul, were named by Charles Koch as being on a shortlist of candidates he might support, though that is unlikely to discourage others from courting the Kochs., Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal recently reversed his support for the Export-Import Bank, a government-backed credit agency that lends to foreign buyers of American products. The Kochs oppose the bank, putting them at odds with many conservative allies, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce., Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who once evangelized in the banks favor, recently penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal explaining his newfound opposition to it., Although the age of the mega-donor may transform the nominating process, it remains to be seen whether it will lead to an election day victory., John Weaver, who served as McCains political advisor for his presidential runs in 2000 and 2008, noted that the influence of such donors in 2012 made Mitt Romney, the eventual Republican nominee, believe he had to take more conservative positions during the primary, hurting him in the general election., If a candidate doesnt really have grass-roots support, financial support, and cant raise money broadly  then what the hell are they doing? Weaver said., Nonetheless, like others, he expects more candidates to stay in the race longer this year. They may be able to survive a poor showing in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada and continue campaigning, even if they are long shots to get the nomination., The decider, Rath said, becomes something other than the ballot box., @lisamascaro, @noahbierman]", "Date": "20150609", "Title": "[Forget voters: Presidential rivals battle to win over billionaires]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-battle-for-the-billionaires-20150609-story.html", "Author": "[Lisa Mascaro, Noah Bierman ]"}
{"Content": "[[, Novelist and longtime Scotland resident J.K. Rowling did not mention national security issues when she recently donated 1 million pounds ($1.71 million) to the Better Together Campaign, which wants Scottish voters to reject the independence option in the Sept. 18 referendum. Rowling  creator of Harry Potter and Hogwarts School of Witchcraft  did emphasize the economic downsides of a divorce from the rest of the United Kingdom. But if her funds and celebrity status help \"no\" voters carry the day, she will share the credit for a real-life geo-strategic feat: saving Britains nuclear deterrent., The pro-independence leaders of the ruling Scottish National Party have pledged to terminate arrangements, dating from the 1960s, for basing British ballistic missile submarines and their nuclear warheads at Faslane and Coulport on Scotlands west coast. In June, they unveiled an interim constitution that would obligate a newly independent Scottish government to \"pursue negotiations with a view to securing nuclear disarmament  and the safe and expeditious removal from the territory of Scotland of nuclear weapons based there.\" The proposed constitution does not specify a deadline, but if the referendum passes, the nationalists hope to see the submarines and warheads removed by 2020., At the same time, the British governments case for replacing, beginning in 2028, the aging force of four Vanguard-class submarines (which carry U.S.-built Trident missiles) with a \"like-for-like\" fleet of four new boats has scored political gains over the last year., In July 2013, the British Cabinet Office published its assessment of potential alternatives to the \"like-for-like\" plan. These include building only two or three submarines, replacing some or all of the Trident systems with yet-to-be developed nuclear-armed and stealthy cruise missiles, and abandoning the Royal Navys \"continuous at sea deterrence\" posture, which requires one sub to be on patrol at all times., Conservative Prime Minister David Camerons coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats, had insisted on the study, claiming that nuclear cutbacks would save money and that ending the continuous patrols (a \"hangover from the Cold War,\" according to one Liberal Democrat leader) would speed progress toward disarmament., But the assessment found that none of those alternatives offered the overall deterrence and operational advantages of the \"like-for-like\" approach. Moreover, some would cost more than the roughly $34-billion life-cycle price of the \"like-for-like\" plan., And this month, an independent experts commission, including prominent figures linked to the coalition parties and the Labor opposition, concluded unanimously that Britain should retain and deploy a nuclear arsenal. According to the commissions report, \"We cannot expect the United States to shoulder indefinitely the awesome responsibilities that lie in providing extended nuclear deterrence to Europe, particularly if the United Kingdom were to abandon its own nuclear force.\" Ironically, the commission had been assembled by BASIC, a small but influential British-American think tank whose stated goal is a nuclear weapon-free world., The debate over the successor deterrent remains unsettled and might flare up during Britains parliamentary elections campaign next spring. Even within the countrys defense community, some argue that funds would be better spent for conventional military capabilities. Ultimately, the next government would decide, in 2016, how many new subs to buy., However, if Scottish voters opt for independence, that picture will change radically. A defense ministry report to Parliament warns that any other arrangement for basing the deterrent force would involve \"huge\" costs. George Robertson, a former British defense minister and NATO secretary general, believes the costs of moving the nuclear force out of Scotland could be prohibitive. \"Effectively, it might mean the unilateral nuclear disarming of the remainder of the United Kingdom,\" he told a Washington audience in April., That would be a tough blow for Britains two nuclear allies and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as a whole., For decades, the special nuclear relationship between the United States and Britain, underpinned by their 1958 Mutual Defense Agreement, has ensured that their respective strategies, weapons systems and operational concepts are well coordinated and mutually supportive. As is the case in the United States with the president, only the prime minister can authorize the use of his nations nuclear forces. This complicates the planning of any potential aggressor, strengthening NATOs deterrence and collective defense pillars. The two governments also work very closely on sensitive nuclear proliferation issues, including Iran., British-French nuclear cooperation is more recent and restricted. Under the 2010 Lancaster House treaty, the countries share two laboratories related to nuclear weapons safety and reliability. Yet, beyond the cost savings of such arrangements, the French have a strategic stake in keeping Britain in the nuclear weapons business. As retired Gen. Henri Bentegeat, a former chief of defense, told French Parliament members in April, \"By helping the British  we are also protecting our own nuclear deterrent. Imagine the intense pressures that France would confront if they were forced to abandon their deterrent.\", But for now, theres little that Washington or Paris can do to help London keep Scotland in the fold. President Obamas mention last month of Americas \"deep interest\" in Britain remaining a \"strong, robust, united, and effective partner\" was an implicit rebuke to Scottish independence leaders. Recent opinion polls show a lead for the \"no\" vote, but a significant number of likely voters are undecided. And as the Economist notes, the nationalists \"have fire in their bellies.\" Hence, louder expressions of concern by American or French officials may be counterproductive., If the nationalists in Scotland win, however, British, American and French strategists will need all the wizardry they can muster., Leo Michel is a research fellow at the National Defense University in Washington.

{"Content": "[[, On a gray wintry day outside the Capitol, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) stood on the grassy East Lawn and denounced President Obamas plan to temporarily defer deportation for millions of immigrants in the country illegally., Gathered to hear the senator was a band of enthusiastic supporters, including a few like-minded lawmakers and a handful of self-described patriots. King Obama! shouted one person in the crowd, which included a man in a tri-cornered hat and others waving the yellow Dont Tread on Me flags of the tea party., Inside the Capitol dome, fiery events like this are met with a collective eye roll, deflating Cruzs currency as a power broker. More temperate legislators have grown weary of such events, which they say are effective at grabbing headlines but polarize positions and hurt the partys brand., That hardly matters out here in the drizzle  and across America, where Cruz is taking his distinct Republican orthodoxy to new heights., On Thursday, as his fellow senators struggled to end a standoff over money for the Homeland Security Department, a confrontation he helped set in motion, Cruz was across the river from the Capitol, at a conservative forum for potential presidential candidates., We need to take the power out of Washington and bring it back to the American people, he declared to the Conservative Political Action Conference, where audience members rushed with their phones to get pictures of him., Cruz seized on a technology metaphor he often uses, comparing himself to apps that have disrupted old ways of doing business, like Uber did to the taxi industry., What Im trying to do more than anything else is bring a disruptive app to politics, he said., His colleagues on Capitol Hill may not appreciate the disruption, but Cruzs backers see him as a rising political star who is redefining the conservative right., The discord between the senators increasing isolation on Capitol Hill and his emerging clout outside the Beltway will only grow louder as the junior senator from Texas steps up preparations for a possible run for the Republican presidential nomination., Can he become a viable 2016 presidential contender without the backing of Republican power brokers, or will Cruz be able to harness his grass-roots following to break into the national conversation without  or even despite  the GOP establishment?, In an interview, Cruz expressed no regrets at being seen as the cowboy-boot-wearing troublemaker of the Senate., You know, to be honest, that doesnt matter, Cruz said, his tall frame hunched in the back seat of a car as he returned from a recent appearance at a technology conference., In my time in the Senate, I have not focused my attention on Washington because Washington is broken, he said. What Ive focused my energy on doing is energizing and empowering the grass roots, because thats the only avenue of real change., Thats not always how established GOP leaders in Washington see it., Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) once famously dismissed Cruz and other tea party lawmakers as wacko birds. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) have made no secret of their displeasure with Cruzs habit of challenging their authority, which helped lead Republicans toward the 2013 government shutdown., For the last several weeks, Cruz has played a significant role in a standoff over funds for the Homeland Security Department. After that December rally on the Capitol lawn, he led conservatives in a strategy to use the departments budget as leverage to try to stop Obamas deportation plan., As the fight over Homeland Security money turned into a logjam that threatened to tag the GOP with causing another partial government shutdown, a frustrated Boehner publicly called on Cruz to step up and fix the problem he had helped create. Cruz, in turn, blamed the GOP leadership for the strategy., Supporters praise Cruzs goals. The disagreement that people had with him was more about tactics than about the substance of his positions, said fellow conservative Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), one of the leaders of the immigration fight against Obama., Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the conservative advocacy group Tea Party Patriots, said, When it comes to Ted Cruz, hes a fighter and he has stuck to his values., But unlike fellow tea party favorites, including Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida, Cruz has a penchant for alienating colleagues in pursuit of bold legislative strategies that often fail., Rather than climbing the GOP leadership ladder, Cruz covets his outsider status. His long-shot 2012 election to the Senate stunned the party., The nastier the reception in Washington, the more appreciation you receive outside of Washington, he said., Cruz honed his conservative philosophy as a teen debate star in Texas before heading off to Harvard Law School and then becoming the state of Texas chief appellate advocate. At 44, Cruz has tried to cultivate an image as being not only the smartest guy in the room, but the most conservative. Few can claim the space to his right, and he likes it that way., But his quirky style and pedantic manner sometimes grate on other Republicans, whom he amicably dismisses as graybeards., In the run-up to the 2013 government shutdown, Cruz delivered an all-night talk-a-thon against the Affordable Care Act during which he impersonated Darth Vader from Star Wars. On April Fools Day, he rolled up a shirtsleeve on Fox & Friends to reveal a faux tattoo of Winston Churchill, one of his heroes. And last fall, Cruz protested Obamas immigration executive action in a floor speech that recast, almost word for word, one by Cicero, the Roman orator., He has a softer side, as well. During his all-night speech, he read aloud from Dr. Seuss for his young daughters who were up late watching C-SPAN at home. An office end table displays a small bobblehead collection, which includes one of late Supreme Court Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, for whom he clerked after law school., Cruz views his work as part of a longer strategy to bend the political agenda toward conservative values., His goals may not have been achieved  Obamacare remains law  but his methods clearly have jolted the conversation in Washington., His office logged 2,000 calls a day in support of the 16-day shutdown in 2013, his staff said, and his anti-Obamacare petition got more than 1 million backers., That attention hasnt hurt his national fundraising efforts, either, a key consideration for anyone hoping to be president. Cruz raked in more than $80,000 during the shutdown period, more than all but a few senators, most of whom were running for reelection or in leadership, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money and politics., As the 2016 field takes shape, Cruz is trying to broaden his profile  writing a book about his life and policy preferences and burnishing his foreign policy credentials with a recent trip to a security conference in Munich, Germany, where he accompanied McCain., Though he hasnt announced plans to run for president, Cruz made an appearance in January at a gathering of wealthy donors aligned with the Koch brothers and was a conservative favorite at the first major Republican gathering of potential presidential contenders in Iowa., Ted Cruz had the highest bar to reach  and he exceeded it, said the Iowa events host, GOP Rep. Steve King, a Cruz ally and regular at his office pizza parties where they spitball strategy., Many believe Cruz understands his electoral limits in 2016, but will capitalize on the opportunity to insert himself as a major player and potential kingmaker. Not bad for a freshman senator whos never held elected office before., One scenario has Cruz taking a role more like that played by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin or perhaps Jim DeMint, a former senator from South Carolina who left office to become president of the conservative Heritage Foundation  outsiders who try to swing the game from unlikely centers of power., Cruz dismisses that idea as not remotely accurate. But his actions during a recent private retreat of House and Senate Republicans did not look like those of someone rolling up his sleeves for the hard work of legislating., Instead, several people noted, Cruz declined to join many of the panel sessions where lawmakers hammered out policy, preferring to chat one-on-one with a few lawmakers in the halls., Hes a very  obviously  bright, articulate person, and he commands quite a following, said fellow Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican in the chamber, who acknowledged having differences with his colleagues tactics. The question is: What do you want to do? Do you want to run for president, or do you want to be an effective senator?, More seasoned politicians suggest, sometimes paternalistically, that Cruz simply needs more time and experience., We just gotta keep working with Ted, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), a conservative former governor, said with a sigh. You want all that intelligence and energy to be channeled., Meantime, Cruz continues his speechmaking, often to the frustration of potential allies., At a recent news conference, a robust group of House and Senate Republicans  including some party leaders  stood behind Cruz to voice support for his call to use Homeland Security funds to force Obama to back down on immigration., But as the questions dragged on, so did Cruzs answers. One by one, the other lawmakers slipped away, until Cruz, without even realizing it, stood almost alone., lisa.mascaro@latimes.com, Twitter: @lisamascaro, ]", "Date": "20150226", "Title": "[Sen.

Joni Ernst, a lieutenant colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard who is running on a promise that she would bring Iowa ways to Washington, D.C., Braley and his fellow Democrats have tried to paint Ernst as too extreme for Iowa, particularly given its increasingly blue tinge. As with Senate candidate Cory Gardner of Colorado, Democrats have argued that Ernst is far more conservative than most Iowa women on issues such as abortion and personhood., On Wednesday, both Braley and Clinton spent a good deal of time discussing those issues, as well as their support for raising the minimum wage and wage equality for men and women., It is not enough to be a woman. You have to be committed to expanding rights and opportunities for all women, Clinton said in a dig at Ernst, made without mentioning her name. She laid out a series of questions for Ernst and other GOP candidates on personhood measures -- which would give full human rights from the moment of conception -- and access to affordable contraception coverage., Theres a big difference between these two candidates,\" she said., Clinton also touted the nations improving economy  You can see Americas comeback  but quickly noted that the economy had not improved for everyone and that it was increasingly hard to maintain a middle-class lifestyle., We have more work to do, and thats whats going to be on the agenda of your next senator, she said., She also reminded the crowd of her husbands record as president. Millions of new jobs were created, more families made it into the middle class, and more families got lifted out of poverty, she said to applause., Clinton acknowledged that she was preaching to the choir, by urging members of the audience to get out and vote, but she encouraged them to nudge their friends and neighbors to the polls., Campaign staff kept the event intimate, using tickets to cap the crowd at a couple of hundred people, who filled the front third of the hall between barricades that separated the crowd from the stage on one end and the press area on the other. , There is a path that can lead you to a better world, Clinton said, joking that she was taking on the role of preacher. And that path leads to the kind of senator that Iowa deserves. If you want a senator who doesnt believe that Iowa is for sale to the highest bidder, please do everything you can for the next six days., \"You dont want to wake up a day after the election and wish you had done more, Clinton said.

A CNN/ORC poll taken in Iowa and released Wednesday showed Bush with 5% support compared with front-runner Donald Trumps 22%., Bush and his campaign profess to be unconcerned, and are convinced that Trumps front-runner status will be as ephemeral as the early leads enjoyed by Newt Gingrich, Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain in the 2012 cycle., Bush, who has referred to himself as the \"joyful tortoise\" in the race for the GOP nomination, brushed aside recent polls as irrelevant., \"Ill remind you that my dad in 1980 was probably an asterisk at this point,\" Bush said at the Iowa State Fair on Friday. The elder Bush won the Iowa caucuses in 1980 but ultimately lost the nomination., \"And last time around, there were candidates that were winning at this point that never even made it to the starting line,\" Bush said., Several factors are contributing to Bushs inability to break out: the crowded field of 17 candidates. The unexpected and sustained rise of Trump. Bushs positions on immigration and Common Core education standards, which are at odds with the most conservative voters. The double-edged sword of his last name. And a lack of heavy stumping in the early states, where voters demand numerous intimate meetings., Dennis Albaugh, an Iowa billionaire who has donated to Bush, said the candidate needed to be more aggressive., \"It doesnt look good right now,\" said Albaugh, who hosted an event  set amid his massive collection of classic Chevrolets  that Bush headlined Thursday in Ankeny, Iowa., \"I think that hes got to get on track.\", Al Cardenas, a longtime Bush advisor and fundraiser, said Bushs natural advantages would ultimately propel him forward once the election gets closer., \"During this curiosity stage, outsiders, newer faces in the national scene are an attractive option till voters start getting very serious,\" he said. \"This very serious stage will probably begin in late October, November.\", Bush has the resources to sustain a long, multi-state strategy. Many of his rivals do not., \"Its a long haul,\" Bush said. \"Were just at the beginning of this.\", The former governor has also raised concerns because he has faltered in venues where he should shine, most recently the first Republican debate in Cleveland. Critics blame his lackluster performance on rustiness from not campaigning for more than a decade; supporters argue it is driven by his introverted nature and will improve with practice., \"He didnt stand out,\" said Doug Gross, a Des Moines attorney who was the Iowa finance chairman for George W.

Most of his responses \"were relatively ineffective and not memorable.\", Bush, who has largely spent this year fundraising, and a super PAC backing his candidacy are ramping up their wooing of voters., The Right to Rise USA Super PAC, which can accept unlimited donations, will buy $10 million of ad time in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina on Monday, according to the Associated Press., Bushs staff says his increased presence on the campaign trail is not in response to the low poll numbers, but instead is dictated by the natural contours of the electoral cycle., \"The closer you get to the voting contests, the more time you spend talking to voters,\" said a top Bush advisor who soughtanonymity before agreeing to speak about the campaigns strategy. \"We had an early fundraising push. Now were focused on trying to strike a balance between the early states, the big delegate states and finance events.\", The advisor added: \"Hes going to be campaigning to win, and that means you have got to go everywhere and go hard at it.\", To that end, Bush crammed in six appearances in three states over four days last week:, On Tuesday, he delivered a foreign policy speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, arguing that the withdrawal of troops from Iraq led to the rise of Islamic State. The next day he rolled out endorsements from Sens. Dean Heller of Nevada and Orrin G. Hatch of Utah at a rally in Reno, followed by a town hall meeting in North Las Vegas., On Thursday, Bush spoke about national security at a forum in Davenport, Iowa, and then at a county GOP fundraiser in Ankeny. On Friday, wearing cowboy boots embroidered with his name, Bush hit the Iowa State Fair. He ditched his Paleo diet and nibbled on a deep-fried Snickers bar, sipped mid-morning beer and flipped pork chops at a grill., Bush has spent much of his time on the campaign trail trying to establish an identity separate from his father and brother. But his brothers shadow  and the unpopular Iraq war he launched in 2003  looms everywhere., At the Des Moines Register Soapbox at the fair, where candidates traditionally take the stage and talk to voters for 20 minutes, someone reminded Bush on Friday that his brother signed the agreement for combat troops to leave Iraq by the end of 2011. Bush responded that the agreement was expected to be modified., NEWSLETTER:Get the days top headlines from Times Editor Davan Maharaj >>, Supporters, such as Ronald Fodor, the mayor of Slippery Rock, Pa., worry that voters may be wary of a third Bush presidency., Fodor had reason to be upbeat after seeing Bushs appearance at the Soapbox, where the candidate stood near bales of hay taking questions from voters., \"He was more enthusiastic than he was in the debate, and I thought he had some very good answers to the questions, and he seemed very prepared and he seemed very presidential,\" Fodor said., Such retail politicking is key if Bush wants to improve his standing in Iowa, said Sen.

{"Content": "[[, Once an afterthought, Latino voters have moved to the center of the 2016 presidential campaign, the object of early and unprecedented courtship by candidates on both sides., The efforts, both substantive and symbolic, reflect a political map that has changed dramatically with the transformation of states such as Nevada, Colorado and others that are no longer the white, Republican bastions of old., President Obama twice carried Nevada, Colorado, Virginia and Florida, thanks in good part to strong support among their growing Latino populations; in Nevada, the Latino share of the vote has tripled in the last 20 years., All four are once more expected to be among the few competitive states in 2016., A key question is whether the eventual Democratic nominee can cement those gains for elections to come, or Republicans can reverse their dismal performance of the last two presidential contests and, by doing so, expand their narrow path to the White House., Republicans seem to stand their best chance in years of harvesting Latino support with the candidacy of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants; and the expected run by the states former governor, Jeb Bush, whose wife is Mexican-born and who is fluent in both the Spanish language and Latino culture., Every week seemingly brings a new Bush appearance before Latino voters  a town hall in Puerto Rico, a speech to evangelical leaders in Houston  where he delivers, in English and Spanish, a message unlike any heard from previous Republican presidential hopefuls., First, though, he and Rubio have to navigate their partys nominating process, a course dominated by white conservatives who favor a hard-line approach to immigration reform, the very issue that has driven so many Latinos into the arms of Democrats., \"In essence, Hispanic voters tell us our partys position  has become a litmus test, measuring whether we are meeting them with a welcome mat or a closed door,\" members of a Republican task force wrote in a postmortem after the partys nominee, Mitt Romney, won fewer than 3 in 10 Latino votes in 2012., The most specific policy recommendation in the 97-page autopsy was support for comprehensive immigration reform, which, translated, means going beyond the law enforcement remedies favored by the partys bedrock supporters. Of the top-tier candidates, only Bush and Rubio have embraced that approach., It was hardly coincidental that Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton last week unveiled her immigration policy in Las Vegas or that, in doing so, she checked off much of the wish list of Latino activists, including a path to citizenship for millions of people in the country illegally and more compassionate enforcement of the countrys border laws., Nevada enjoys a prominent place on the nominating calendar, now slotted as the third to vote after contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. But more than that, the state mirrors the broad demographic changes that are reshaping politics across the country by the day., In 1994, more than 90% of Nevada voters were white, a number that shrank to 67% in 2012. Over the same period, the Latino share of voters grew from 5% to 15%, a percentage expected to increase further by 2016., (Nationally, Latinos accounted for 10% of the vote in the last presidential race. They are expected to account for nearly half of the growth in the eligible electorate between now and 2030, according to research by the nonpartisan Pew Hispanic Center.), If a Democrat hopes to be president, he or she must not only reassemble Obamas winning coalition, which included Latinos and other minorities, but ensure that those voters turn out in robust numbers. Clintons immigration proposals seem calculated to do just that, leaving Republicans the unpalatable choice of seconding her views  and alienating their conservative base  or rejecting them and risking further estrangement from Latino voters., Nevada offers an object lesson., Last year, with a virtually uncontested governors race and little effort by state Democrats to spur turnout, Latino voters stayed home in droves. As a result, Republicans not only swept every statewide constitutional office, they knocked off a supposedly safe Democratic House member here in Las Vegas and seized control of the state Legislature for the first time since the 1920s., \"Democrats cant take those voters for granted,\" said David Damore, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas, expert on Latino political participation. \"They need to spend money on outreach, get-out-the-vote, Spanish-language advertising. Without them, Democrats dont win.\", Clinton apparently got the message: Two of her first Nevada hires, campaign director Emmy Ruiz and organizing director Jorge Neri, helped Obama win 70% of the states Latino vote in 2012., For Republicans, the imperative is less urgent, given their overwhelming support among white male voters. But their nominee cant afford a Romney-style blowout., Whit Ayres, a veteran GOP pollster working for Rubio, believes the partys eventual nominee will need to win more than 40% of the Latino vote to carry the White House, a performance only two Republicans  Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush  have approached in the last 35 years. (Obama won 67% of the Latino vote in 2008 and 71% in 2012.), This time Bushs brother, Jeb, has been most conspicuous in his courtship of Latino support. \"Were an immigrant nation and we should be proud,\" he recently told supporters during a stop in Puerto Rico. \"I know about the immigrant experience because I married a beautiful girl from Mexico. My children are bicultural and bilingual.\", Rubio, of course, neednt reach to make that cultural connection. If anything, he seems to downplay his Latino heritage as he appeals to white conservative audiences., But implicit in his very candidacy is the chance for Republicans to make history by nominating their first-ever minority standard-bearer, who, as a youthful Latino, reflects the demographic wave inexorably remaking the country, state by state., For decades, Latinos were characterized  patronized, some said  as a slumbering giant: large in number, potentially powerful but largely apathetic and politically impotent. No more., Now voters such as Santos Garcia have become highly sought-after., \"Theyre going to want our support,\" said Garcia, a 59-year-old kitchen worker at Harrahs casino on the Las Vegas Strip. \"Without the Spanish vote they know they cant win.

{"Content": "[[, Once Hillary Rodham Clintons charismatic rival, then her unpopular boss, President Obama was bound to pose a bit of quandary for Clinton as she once again pursues the presidency., The conflict between remaining loyal to a Democratic president and staking out her own turf was front and center this week as Clinton opened her campaign in Iowa  and particularly when she spoke about the economy., Clinton never directly criticized Obama, whom she served as secretary of State for four years. But she also didnt give him much credit for the nations economic recovery. Instead, during her two-day swing through the state, Clinton repeatedly struck populist notes about income inequality, stagnating wages and the drag on small businesses from tightened credit., The theme  a foundation of her campaign  was that hard-working Americans are responsible for what recovery has occurred and that much more needed to be done for those who continue to struggle., \"As good as it is that weve kind of dug ourselves out of the hole of the Great Recession, were not up and running yet,\" Clinton said Wednesday at a small-business roundtable at a fruit-packing warehouse in Norwalk, south of Des Moines. \"And, unfortunately, the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top, and we need to reshuffle the cards and begin to play a different hand, a hand that includes everybody whos willing to work hard and do their part.\", The previous day, Clinton cited the wage disparity between big corporation CEOs and average workers, and the tax rate inequality between hedge fund managers and nurses., \"Weve got to figure out in our country how to get back on the right track,\" she said during an appearance in Monticello., All in all, it was a notable distancing from a Democratic president she served. (The former senator and first lady did praise Obamas signature healthcare overhaul, his proposal to make community college free and the first law he signed upon taking office the Lily Ledbetter Act, which benefitted women workers.), Clintons careful dance was driven by competing needs. As she embarks on her second White House run, its critical for her to capture the passion of the Obama supporters  notably the young voters  who helped him defeat her in 2008. But she must also win over the swing-state, rust-belt and white voters who have soured on him., Shes also up against the sentiments of voters, who typically seek a change in party, Democrat or Republican, after two presidential terms. (Winning a third successive term has happened only once since Harry Trumans 1948 victory, in 1988 when George H.W. Bush succeeded two-term Republican President Ronald Reagan.), Clintons challenge, running to succeed a two-term president she served, has been pursued twice in recent elections. In 2000, Vice President Al Gore backed almost completely away from President Bill Clinton and their shared economic record, fearful of the stain of Clintons sex scandal and impeachment. He lost and was widely criticized for failing to use Clinton to his advantage. In 1988, however, Bush won a third successive Republican term with this logic: If the country was switching horses after Ronald Reagans two terms, the least it could do was pick one going in the same direction., Both Reagan and Clinton were popular when they left office. Obama, so far, is less so. Candidates actively avoided him during the 2014 midterm elections, giving Hillary Clinton another reason to distance herself., Even before opening her campaign in Iowa, a state Obama twice won but where his favorability ratings have been underwater for two years, Clinton started to distinguish herself from Obama. In her memoir, \"Hard Choices,\" she wrote that they disagreed on whether to arm Syrian rebels. In an August interview, she went further, calling Obamas inaction on Syria a \"failure\" and directly criticizing his approach to foreign policy., In Iowa, Clinton did not mention Obama by name as she discussed the economy. But she struck at the limits of the economic recovery during his terms, and seemed as well to repudiate his approach., Obama, in a controversial 2012 comment, said that entrepreneurs success relied on help from government and others, a sentiment seized on by Republicans then trying to push him from office., \"If youve got a business, you didnt build that. Somebody else made that happen,\" Obama said in a speech in Roanoke, Va., Clinton, talking with the founder of a digital ad agency about her plans to reform the tax code and the discrepancy between the credits available for large and small businesses, reversed the emphasis., \"Youve built this company. Its your labor and your intelligence that made it what it is and youve got big plans for it, but youre being squeezed,\" she sympathized., Her riff about difficulties facing entrepreneurs and sobering statistics about the plight of small business start-ups in the U.S. seemed akin to what is routinely heard at GOP rallies., \"Its become more difficult, more expensive, more red tape, unnecessary regulations that has really put a damper and that was unfortunately exacerbated greatly by the effects of the Great Recession, where a lot of banks stopped lending,\" Clinton said. \"I want to make middle class mean something again.\", Twitter: @latseema]", "Date": "20150416", "Title": "[Hillary Clinton: Distancing from Obama while courting his supporters]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-clinton-obama-iowa-20150416-story.html", "Author": "[Seema Mehta]"}
{"Content": "[[, One consequence of the steady decline of unions in America is that weve forgotten what little we used to know about what organized labor even means., Union members are often depicted as lazy and overpaid, and job actions as a threat to the livelihoods of average Americans., These points would be a lot harder to make stick if union representation today still reached 23.3% of all private and public workers as it did in 1963 (according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics), rather than 12.3%, and if union members were still 16.6% of the private workforce, as in 1963, instead of 6.6%., It certainly would be a lot harder to depict union members as outsiders at war with society. USA Today, for instance, observed in an editorial that \"the longshoremen who are causing so much grief to workers and businesses around the country are among the nations best-paid blue-collar workers.\" It noted that a contract with raises of 2.8% a year for five years \"seems reasonable,\" since the average full-time longshoreman makes $147,000 a year (according to the employers; the union says its much less than that)., The editorial counseled the port workers that it may not be \"worthwhile to rock the boat so much\" because \"things are very good for them.\", But how poor do unionized workers have to be for them to be eligible to bargain for raises?, The subtext is that unions are on their way out, and that taking actions like agitating for pay and benefits will only hasten their disappearance. Recent events, however, are pointing in the opposite direction. Labor organizations are starting to show new creativity and militancy in attaining their goals., Some 6,500 members of the United Steelworkers are now on strike at 15 refineries across the country, including the nations largest. Refinery owners say the issue is about preserving union jobs, but for the union its more about safety: \"Onerous overtime; unsafe staffing levels; dangerous conditions the industry continues to ignore,\" a USW statement says. Thats bound to resonate when explosions and fires at refineries remain frequent occurrences  including a big blast Feb. 18 at Exxon Mobils Torrance refinery. As my colleague Tiffany Hsu has documented, overwork and employee fatigue are rife at Tesoro Corp.s Carson plant., Unions are mobilizing even for workers who arent their own members. The Fight for 15 movement for a $15 hourly minimum wage for fast-food workers was launched by the Service Employees International Union in 2012, even though few are unionized. But the movement, and other union pressure to raise the minimum wage in the restaurant and retail industries, plainly has helped place higher wages for low-income workers on the agenda for politicians and labor-intensive companies including Wal-Mart. The retail giants decision to increase minimum pay to $10 an hour by April 2016 already has been followed by TJX Corp., the owner of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and other retailers., The Fight for 15 is \"significant in two ways,\" said Thomas Geoghegan, a veteran Chicago labor attorney and author on unionization topics. \"It shows theres some point in going out and disrupting, and it builds morale, even if it hasnt brought in a lot of dues yet.\", Unions are proving more nimble at snatching victory from the jaws of even major defeats, such as the United Auto Workers loss of a hard-fought organizing vote last year at a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tenn. The loss was commonly described as a \"devastating\" setback in the UAWs effort to organize auto workers in the South. Yet today the UAW is negotiating with Volkswagen over a voice in work conditions at that very plant, where it still represents at least 45% of the workers., The union defeat made nationwide news, but its success at bringing Volkswagen to the table has stayed under the national radar., Attacks on unionization rights have been proliferating. The most recent example is the fast-track passage of a \"right-to-work\" measure by the Wisconsin Senate. The bill, which will come before the state Assembly this week and is expected to be signed by Gov. Scott Walker, a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination, would bar labor contracts that require workers to pay union fees., Geoghegan argues that the Republicans anti-union campaign could backfire, by raising the profile of labor rights as a Democratic issue. \"I can tell you with absolute certainty that the right has not given this a lot of thought,\" he said., Last year Democratic Reps. Keith Ellison of Minnesota and John Lewis of Georgia introduced a bill to recognize labor organizing as a civil right. Lawrence Summers, the former chief economist for the Obama White House and a quintessential centrist Democrat, lately has been highlighting the role of collective bargaining in raising wages. In the words of a January report by a Commission on Inclusive Prosperity co-chaired by Summers, \"expanding the benefits of collective bargaining in the United States ... would help reverse the trend toward wage inequality for U.S. middle- and lower-income workers.\", The presidential election already is shaping up as a test of which party can depict itself better as a friend of the middle class. Republicans tried to claim the mantle during the 2014 midterm elections, and many voters may have believed them. Yet attacks on unionization rights are fundamentally at odds with the interests of the middle and working class. Efforts to undermine collective-bargaining rights and union resources have only one goal, nicely articulated by the former corporate hatchet man Martin Jay Levitt in his 1993 book, \"Confessions of a Union Buster\": \"The enemy was the collective spirit. I got hold of that spirit while it was still a seedling; I poisoned it, choked it, bludgeoned it if I had to, anything to be sure it would never blossom into a united work force, the dreaded foe of any corporate tyrant.\", Its impossible to know just yet how far the pushback will go, but something is stirring., Michael Hiltziks column appears Sundays and Wednesdays.

{"Content": "[[, One night a few years back, a California communications executive named Deborah Bowker was worried about her husband, who was sick and hospitalized. An old friend told her she shouldnt be alone, that she should come over and stay the night., The guest bedroom at the friends house was used most often by grandchildren, and contained two tiny beds. That night, Bowker was crying herself to sleep in one of them when the door cracked open. Without a word, Carly Fiorina padded across the room and crawled into the other bed., Bowker and Fiorina have been close friends since they went to MIT together, and little changed for 20 years  until Fiorina decided to run for the U.S. Senate, with Bowker as her chief of staff., CAMPAIGN 2016: Get the latest news on the presidential race on Trail Guide >>, That fretful night doesnt seem like a big deal now. Bowkers husband recovered, and Fiorina might not even remember it, Bowker said with a laugh. Bowker said she hadnt told the story before and wasnt sure why she was telling it now  except that she hardly recognizes Fiorina in the image thats been created through the veneer of politics., Those closest to Fiorina, 56, describe her as loyal and fun-loving, witty and bright. But they are well aware of the other image  of a pompous diva, aligned with the most strident factions of her Republican Party, pampered by a golden parachute after being fired from her high-profile job., Fiorina the candidate hasnt always helped matters. Her tone on the stump can be caustic. At one point in her dogged campaign against the Democratic incumbent, Sen. Barbara Boxer, an open microphone caught her belittling Boxers hair as \"so yesterday.\", In a sneering attempt to connect with a \"tea party\" crowd near Fresno recently, she referred to San Francisco  the center of the metropolitan area where she spent nearly half of her life, the city just up the road from her 5,400-square-foot Los Altos Hills estate  as \"that faraway world.\", And her critics tend to roll their eyes when Fiorina  who was raised on opera and French lessons, was the daughter of a powerful judge and has a sterling academic pedigree  pitches herself as a kind of Horatio Alger. Her journey, she said at one recent campaign event, was \"only possible in the United States of America.\", Getting to know the person friends call \"the real Carly,\" meanwhile, can be a confounding task. Stung by several episodes in her life, including the unraveling of her first marriage and the brouhaha surrounding her firing from Hewlett-Packard, where she was chief executive, president and chairman, she is private and guarded., Fiorinas work ethic is legendary, and her discipline is one reason Boxer  a lioness of the left seeking her fourth Senate term  is in arguably the toughest race of her career. But Fiorina can be so on-message that she comes across as a machine., During a recent heat wave, Fiorina met with business leaders in a sweltering City of Industry warehouse. A visitor joked that the record heat might cause her to rethink her position on global warming. Fiorina was not amused, launching instantly into her talking points about climate change  contending that she reserved the right to \"challenge the science.\", On the campaign trail, it can be difficult to envision the Fiorina who could often be found dancing with the interns and the secretaries at the end of corporate parties, long after the other executives were gone. Or the woman who, on a recent boat trip, suddenly disappeared; she had jumped off the stern and hauled herself onto a tiny raft with her step-granddaughters., Friends say shes a fair cook and has a nice touch on the piano. She was raised Episcopalian but is not a regular churchgoer. She does Jane Fonda-style aerobics, whether shes home or on the road., She reads policy briefs on her iPad but reads books the old-fashioned way. Shes a voracious shopper, said one friend of 20 years, and gave one Hong Kong jeweler enough business that he put her picture in the window. She has at her disposal a household net worth estimated as high as $121 million and yachts on both coasts, and will be one of the wealthiest members of Congress if she wins., She and her husband, Frank Fiorina, a former AT&T executive with blue-collar roots in Pittsburgh, have been married for 25 years. It is a second marriage for both; she calls him a \"hunk\" with some frequency., Last fall, she threw him a sock-hop-themed 60th birthday party, tracking down friends he hadnt seen in 30 years. Fiorina was stylish as ever, said an old friend, Kathy Fitzgerald, in a black dress and textured stockings  and, since she was being treated for breast cancer, bald., Cara Carleton Sneed was born in Austin, Texas. Her mother, a talented oil painter, was a refugee from a troubled childhood in Ohio. Her father, Joseph Tyree Sneed III, was a University of Texas law professor whose ambition in academia meant that she was perpetually \"the new kid,\" she wrote in her autobiography, as the family moved repeatedly., In 1969, while teenagers across America experimented with a new counterculture, Fiorina was in Ghana, where her father was teaching students about the countrys new constitution., Fiorinas father soon joined the Stanford law faculty, and she graduated from Stanford with a degree in philosophy and medieval history  which, she jokes, rendered her unemployable. She bounced from job to job, working as a typist, a temp, a receptionist. In 1980, she signed on as a management trainee with AT&T., There, the more confident and tenacious she became, the brighter her star shined. She persuaded the companys chairman to sue the federal government for giving away AT&Ts pricing information; it was a risk, and it worked. She selected AT&T-spinoff Lucents red logo with her mothers bold paintings in mind; it was derided initially as \"the million-dollar coffee stain\"  and soon widely imitated., \"She just didnt take no for an answer,\" said Frank Fiorina, who was a mid-level manager at the time., In 1999, Fiorina became, by some measures, the most powerful woman in the history of American business  the chief executive of Palo Alto-based Hewlett-Packard Co. Her makeover of HP, especially her push for a $19-billion merger with Compaq Computer, meant tumult for the company and the technology industry. Layoffs  33,000 by some estimates, though Fiorina says she created more jobs than she eliminated  earned her the disdain of many employees., She lasted until 2005, and her tenure is viewed in two dramatically different ways, both of which cannot be true., To loyalists, she was little short of a visionary, someone whose ideas drove up revenues, reformed a once-plodding company and enabled a storied company that helped launch Silicon Valley to survive the \"tech wreck\" that crippled so many other companies., \"Carlys strategy is what saved HP  no doubt about it,\" said Bill Mutell, who worked for Compaq and retired from HP in 2006 as a senior vice president., Many analysts call that revisionist history, noting, among other things, that HP stock fell by roughly half during her tenure. One business publication ranked her among the worst CEOs in American history, arguing that she was \"posing for magazine covers while her company floundered.\", She was fired, with compensation worth about $42 million., Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld is a senior associate dean at Yale School of Management and founder of the Chief Executive Leadership Institute, a training academy of sorts for CEOs. He has studied HP extensively and called it preposterous that she would stake her candidacy on her business experience., \"This board agreed on nothing else other than they would like to breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. The only other thing they agreed on was that Carly ought to be fired,\" Sonnenfeld said., After HP, Fiorina wrote her memoir, \"Tough Choices,\" and joined the speech circuit, earning as much as $100,000 a pop in Paris, Abu Dhabi, Cabo San Lucas. Her name had been bandied about in political circles for years, and in 2008, she signed on as an advisor to Sen. John McCains presidential campaign. Fiorina joined McCain for long stretches, often acting as emcee at his campaign events., She stumbled on several occasions, particularly after McCain selected then- Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate. After Fiorina told an interviewer that Palin was unqualified to run a corporation, her TV appearances were curtailed., Bowker, Fiorinas chief of staff, questioned whether Fiorinas involvement with the campaign was a good investment of her time. She said Fiorina replied: \"Im learning.\", Fiorina announced her bid for the Senate last fall, pledging to work tirelessly to bring jobs to California  partly by increasing agricultural water supplies in the Central Valley  and to \"take our government back\" by reining in what she calls Washingtons out-of-control spending., Some of her associates were stunned that she had the energy for a campaign; she was on the heels of chemotherapy and surgery. She seemed to be running not in spite of her cancer, but because of it., \"I watched her draw energy\" from the campaign, Bowker said. \"It gave her something in her future to look forward to. Shes an unusual person that way. If it were me, Id want to curl up in a ball.\", The Senate bid is Fiorinas first run for office, but she has a voting record that is spotty at best and, by all accounts, she had little interest in politics well into adulthood., \"She had,\" her first husband, Todd Bartlem, said in a recent interview, \"no opinions.\", She set sail against Boxer with the ideological winds of the moment, tapping into the anti-incumbent anger that has swept some portions of the nation. While decrying the partisan divide in Washington, Fiorina has derided Boxer as \"an embarrassment\" and has claimed that Boxer is backed by environmental \"extremists,\" although she seemed flummoxed recently when asked to name them., In a state where registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans, Fiorina has surprised the political establishment by declining to make many nods toward the center., She has remained a steadfast defender of Arizonas controversial immigration law and has not wavered in support of Proposition 23, the November ballot measure that would suspend efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Fiorina has called Proposition 23 a job-saver and was recently feted at a fundraiser hosted in part by the billionaire Koch brothers, who control oil pipelines and have pumped money into the fight., Fiorina has said she would support overturning Roe vs. Wade, saying her views on abortion were formed largely because Frank Fiorinas mother was told to abort him due to health risks., She is something of a sensation among hard-line conservatives, particularly tea party organizations., \"She takes on impossible things, and she accomplishes them,\" said Glenda Gilliland, a Fresno Tea Party activist who retired from HP in 2005 and attended a recent Fiorina speech. \"I think she will fight  I know she will  for the people of California.\", But Fiorinas support from hard-line conservatives can make for an awkward dynamic; she appears to be more measured and moderate than they think she is. At recent campaign appearances, for example, several of her supporters volunteered to a reporter  as fact  that President Obama is an African-born Muslim., Asked whether shes comfortable with support from that arm of the political spectrum, Fiorina said: \"I certainly dont agree with it. I dont think the president is a Muslim. He clearly is a Christian. He clearly was born in America.\", Meanwhile, two organizations that have said the Obama administration promotes the \"homosexual infiltration of schools\" have spent $60,000 on advertising for Fiorina and pledged more. Fiorinas aides made clear that she does not agree with the groups position  and contended that she has no control over who promotes her candidacy., \"One of the things that has happened in politics that doesnt happen in the rest of life is that people say: Well, if I dont agree with someone 100% of the time, I cant work with them,\" Fiorina said in an interview. \"And I think its why there is so much partisan bickering on both sides of the aisle.\", \"In the rest of life  you rarely agree with someone like that. But if you can find enough common ground, you can get something done,\" she said. \"You can solve a problem. You can accomplish a goal.\"]", "Date": "20101022", "Title": "[Pompous diva or fun-loving friend?

{"Content": "[[, One of the oldest cliches on American elections, attributed to the late House Speaker Thomas P. \"Tip\" ONeill, holds that all politics is local., Not anymore., Indeed, just the opposite holds true: Increasingly, politics has become nationalized., Emory University political science professor Alan Abramowitz, one of the countrys leading experts on political polarization, lays out some of the evidence in a new paper thatalso offers a theory to explain why., The change, Abramowitz writes, is driven by the rise of what he calls negative partisanship  the belief by voters that supporters of the opposite party are very different from themselves, and not in a good way., Anyone who has followed headlines about Congress for the last decade has probably absorbed the fact that polarization has widened dramatically among elected officials., A few decades ago, both parties had conservative and liberal wings, and the votes of Democratic and Republican members of Congress often overlapped. Bipartisan coalitions moved nearly all major legislation, and local issues drove a lot of votes., Today, the Republicans have become a consistently conservative party. Democrats remain somewhat more diverse ideologically, but they have shed their conservative bloc. The most centrist Democrats in Congress stand several steps to the left of the few centrist Republicans., Congress has become much more of a parliamentary body than it once was, with members voting almost entirely along party lines on most issues, not along regional or state lines. As a result, divided government  with the White House and Congress controlled by opposite parties  has become more of an invitation to gridlock., A key insight from Abramowitz has been that polarization isnt just a Washington thing: The voters who engage most in the political process  turning out to cast ballots, contributing money, contacting elected officials  are also the ones most likely to follow their parties. In dividing along rigid ideological lines, elected officials represent the voting part of the public., In 2012, Abramowitz reports, 91% of people who either openly identified with a party or called themselves independent but leaned to a party, actually voted for thatpartys candidate for president. That tied a record set in 2004., Down the ballot, the record-setting continued: 89% of those who cast ballots in 2012 voted a straight, party-line ticket for the president and House of Representatives, while 90% voted for the same party for president and the U.S. Senate elections. Those levels of straight-ticket, party-line voting, found by American National Election Studies surveys, hit levels last seen when the study project first began to quiz voters in the early 1950s, Abramowitz reported in a paper that he and a graduate student, Steven Webster, prepared for a recent political science conference., All that straight-ticket voting comes despite the fact that more and more American voters call themselves independent., Because partisanship has a bad reputation in the U.S., the independent label appeals to many voters, Abramowitz writes. But the vast majority of people claiming that label are independents in name only. The share of the electorate who truly dont stick with a party is less than 10%., So why has that happened?, Increasingly, Abramowitz says, polls have revealed that voters see the opposing partys supporters in a highly negative light. Much of the gap, he says, stems from the fact that the two parties increasingly are divided along lines of race, religion and culture. Republicans increasingly have come to be the party of white, religiously observant Americans while Democrats draw their support from racial minorities and whites who do not have a strong religious identification., Those racial and cultural shifts have led to a widening ideological gap in which each partys supporters now feel much farther from the opposing partys ideological position than in the past, he writes., Asked to place themselves and each of the two parties on a seven-point scale from conservative to liberal, fewer than 1 in 5 voters in 1972 said the other party was at least four steps away from their position. Now, almost half do. Just more than 1 in 5 now put the other party at least five steps away, something that almost no voters said in 1972., Asked to rate their feelings about the other party on a thermometer, with 0 being entirely negative and 100 entirely positive, people who strongly identify with one party or the other went from giving the opposition a largely neutral 41 rating in 1980 to a chilly 24 now. The share of the electorate giving the other party a negative rating has jumped from just more than 1 in 4 to well over half., Not surprisingly, given those negative feelings, voters are far less likely to cast a ballot for a candidate of the other party, even if the candidate is a longtime incumbent with strong local roots. Theyre also more likely to punish elected officials whom they perceive as too willing to compromise with the other side., The nationalization of U.S. elections doomed Democratic senators from conservative states who were up for election in 2014. The same phenomenon probably will create serious problems for several Republican senators running in blue states in 2016., In the House, however, the pattern gives a clear advantage to the GOP. Because Democratic voters cluster in the nations cities, Republican presidential candidates win in significantly more House districts than do Democrats, even when a Democrat wins the White House. With election results increasingly nationalized, that means Democrats will continue to have trouble winning a majority of the House so long as that uneven distribution of where voters live continues., Those trends, Abramowitz writes, lead to a gloomy conclusion: With divided government likely to be a frequent occurrence and little or no incentive for bipartisan compromise, our findings suggest that confrontation and gridlock are almost certain to characterize thepolicy-making process in Washington for the foreseeable future., @DavidLauter]", "Date": "20150420", "Title": "[Rising partisanship among voters is 'nationalizing' local politics]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-polarized-politics-20150420-story.html", "Author": "[David Lauter]"}

Jerry Brown last year to take effect July 1 for large grocery stores and July 1, 2016 for most other retailers., Murray noted that 138 cities and counties have already enacted their own bans on plastic grocery bags and that those will stay in effect. Bag ordinances have been adopted for the Los Angeles County unincorporated areas and more than a dozen cities in the county including Beverly Hills, Glendale, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Malibu, Manhattan Beach, Pasadena, Santa Monica and West Hollywood., The new state law was stayed as soon as the referendum petitions were filed and the qualifying of the referendum continues that stay until voters act, officials said., Supporters of the bag ban expect to spend about $10 million on a campaign to get voters to uphold the ban by voting yes on the referendum., Murray cited a recent USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll that indicated support for the law by 60% of Californians., Every poll shows that Californians strongly support the law, and the $30 million to $50 million it will cost the plastics industry to launch a full-fledged campaign in 2016 will be proven to be an act of political malpractice, particularly since nearly half the state will no longer have plastic bags by election day, Murray said., He estimated that the bag manufacturers will make $145 million in continued sales while the ban is on hold between July 1 and November 2016., His coalition includes Sierra Club California, the Surfrider Foundation, Californians Against Waste and the California Grocers Assn., SB 270 by former Sen.

A majority of voters would have to say yes to the referendum, in favor of the new vaccination law, or it would not go into effect., If the petitions for a referendum qualify for the ballot by Sept. 28 with the signatures of 365,000 registered voters, the law will be put on hold until voters decide the issue., The laws critics, led by former assemblyman and Republican gubernatorial candidate Tim Donnelly of Twin Peaks, said petitions will begin circulating later this week., He expressed confidence that the proposed referendum would make the ballot., \"I think the chances are as good as anything Ive ever seen in terms of a referendum, and we can do it with volunteers because there are so many motivated people who are already organized around the state,\" Donnelly said., He noted that within 72 hours of putting up a Facebook page and website, it already had 8,400 \"likes\" and about 5,000 people had volunteered to circulate petitions and contributed money to the effort., On Tuesday, the leaders of a group of thousands of parents that organized against the law as Our Kids Our Choice endorsed the referendum move., The new law, which Gov. Jerry Brown signed June 30, eliminates the personal belief and religious exemptions that parents have used in the past to seek waivers from state vaccination requirements for their children., State lawmakers and public health officials said the law was needed because a decline in vaccinations had contributed to the spread of disease, including a measles outbreak in California this year that was traced to Disneyland., Opponents of vaccines question their safety and say it should be up to parents, not the government, to decide what medical treatment their children receive., \"This is about a parents right to make an informed decision for their children,\" Donnelly said., Allan Hoffenblum, a Republican consultant who publishes the California Target Book, which handicaps elections, predicted the referendum would qualify for the ballot., Its supporters are \"a minority of people, but its a sizable minority of people,\" Hoffenblum said. \"I would be surprised if it didnt quality. There is a lot of intensity.\", Hoffenblum also predicted that voters would uphold the new law., In a national Harris Poll commissioned by the medical news website HealthDay in March, 82% of respondents said vaccinations should be mandatory for children, and 87% said vaccines are safe., \"I think the majority of California voters would want to make sure any kids in the room with their kids have been vaccinated,\" Hoffenblum said., Sen. Richard Pan (D-Sacramento), a co-author of the new law, agreed., \"My bill was thoroughly vetted in the Legislature with about 20 hours of debate and testimony analyzing every aspect of the law,\" Pan said in a statement, \"and Californians will support protecting our schools and communities over promoting anti-science myths that endanger our children.\", Hoy: La esta historia en espaol, patrick.mcgreevy@latimes.comTwitter: @mcgreevy99, 11:30 a.m. July 15: Article updated throughout., 12:18 p.m. July 14:Articleupdated to include comments by Tim Donnelly and Allan Hoffenblum, This articlewas originally published at 10:02 a.m. July 14.]", "Date": "20150715", "Title": "[Opponents of new California vaccination law begin referendum drive]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-pc-referendum-drive-begins-against-vaccination-law-20150714-story.html", "Author": "[Patrick McGreevy]"}

{"Content": "[[, Organized labor suffered an embarrassing loss in California last month when a defiant Democrat it had targeted for years easily won a state Senate seat over a union-preferred candidate. So it reveled in Fridays victory over President Obama on a trade measure that inspired a battle for the votes of Democratic House members., The trade fight was an epic intraparty mudfest. Unions, the partys biggest source of pavement-pounders and money, barraged undecided House members with phone calls, ads and protests. Obama gathered local television newscasters to the White House to praise the members he hoped would side with him and traveled to Capitol Hill for some last-minute, and ultimately unsuccessful, arm-twisting., The ferocity was still being felt post-vote by the few California Democrats who thwarted labor amid clear threats of retribution., \"Its disappointing that we had a few members vote in a way that we would say was against the interests of working people in California,\" said Steve Smith of the state labor federation. \"And this is something were going to remember.\", Retaliation is always difficult to game out, but in California it would come with a twist: The members labor is angriest at are Democrats who barely won their seats against strong Republican challenges. Damaging a candidate who disagreed on one issue  even a big one  runs a real risk of turning a seat over to a party labor disagrees with almost all the time., In theory, labor could back candidacies by competing Democrats, but theyd have to run against incumbents who have spent years building fundraising networks and potentially alienate fellow Democrats for whom the trade bill is not the most important marker., The tough decisions ahead will come at a dicey time for unions. Historically their fights have been waged with Republicans, but in recent years Democrats have taken them on as well., In Los Angeles, former Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa earned enmity with his budget proposals; current Mayor Eric Garcetti won election in 2013 by slaying his opponent for her ties to a public employee union. A statewide Field Poll taken at the end of 2013 found labors popularity slumping, with 45% of Californians saying unions were a force for harm more than good, to 40% defending them., More trouble lies ahead: Unions anticipate a 2016 ballot measure that would give decision-making power on new employee pensions to voters, not the elected officials who have remained more loyal to labor than have rank-and-file residents., The fight between labor and Obama was in one way lopsided. Trade rarely inspires rapt supporters; those who care about it are more apt to be those threatened by labor agreements, like the North American Free Trade Agreement of the 1990s. It is blamed by unions today for the loss of almost 90,000 California jobs., Echoing the argument made then, Obama insisted that new and better-paying jobs would follow if he was given authority to craft a Pacific Rim trade deal. California, he said, would see its exports skyrocket and its ports grow flush with business. But his partys leaders did not fall into line., State Democratic Party Chairman John Burton said the notion of the treaty \"stinks to high heaven.\" Atty. Gen. Kamala D. Harris asked supporters to add their names to a list of those objecting to \"a reckless rubber stamp\" for Obama  a list that she presumably can use for her U.S. Senate campaign., In the end, only seven California Democrats out of 32 in the House agreed to a preliminary vote that was part of the trade deal. Only five  Reps. Ami Bera of the Sacramento suburbs, Scott Peters and Susan Davis of San Diego, Jim Costa of the Central Valley and the Central Coasts Sam Farr  voted to give the president swift authority to make a trade deal. The first one failed and the second one passed, and the House will take the matter up again this week., The members of Congress who flouted labors wishes said they were voting their districts needs., \"I came to Congress to put people before politics,\" Bera said in a statement, adding that the trade act will include labor and environmental protections \"not seen in any previous trade authority bills.\", Peters emphasized that Fridays votes were on procedural matters, not on a treaty itself., \"Our biotech and hi-tech companies depend on exporting their goods, and as a port city, San Diego depends on access to foreign markets,\" his statement said. \"But trade only works if we set the rules. If we dont step up, someone else like China will.\", Both men won narrowly in 2014 and are targeted by Republicans in 2016. Now Democrats will have to decide whether to aim at them as well., Smith, the labor federation spokesman, said unions understand that they need to persuade Californians about their heft on issues like minimum wage increases and sick-day pay that accrue to \"millions of people across the state.\", And at the same time, labor wants to remind politicians that they need to toe the line., \"Look, were again pleased that the vast majority of congressional Democrats did the right thing today,\" Smith said, just after Fridays vote. \"Well worry about the others later.\", On Twitter: @cathleendecker]", "Date": "20150614", "Title": "[Labor ponders how hard to punish Democrats who back trade measures ]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-pol-california-politics-20150614-story.html", "Author": "[Cathleen Decker]"}

{"Content": "[[, Over the past few days, the field of declared 2016 presidential candidateshas picked up a few more names, each announcement quickly detailed and closely analyzed. Does getting bounced from her seat running Hewlett-Packard, and conducting a solitary and abysmal U.S. Senate campaign, make Carly Fiorinaa serious contender? What about Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor and TV host who already failedin his first bite at the presidential apple? Is former neurosurgeon Ben Carsonin over his head?, For those who follow politics like a spectator sport, these incremental news items are tidbits to be savored. For most of the rest of the country, they are tedious and irrelevant developments in an endless cycle of campaigning., But to the New York Review of Books Elizabeth Drew, the campaign minutiae distractfrom the more important story of the three dangers threatening the American electoral system: voting restrictions, redistricting, and loose rules on large amounts of money being spent to influence voters. In recent years, weve been moving further and further away from a truly democratic election system., In the first of a planned two-part essay, Drew dives into the background of Republican efforts to restrict voting in various states, their successful cornering of state elections, and the effects that has had, and will continue to have, on redistricting. The electoral system has been gamed before our very eyes, but because it has happened slowly, it seems to have gone largely ignored by political reporters focusing on the daily churn (to which I also must plead guilty as a former political campaign reporter). The fix has been put in with the help of the Supreme Court, which gutted the Voting Rights Actand has endorsed voter-IDlaws that are, at best, a solution to an imaginary problem., By the time of the 2014 elections twenty-one states had enacted new restrictions on voting rights, Drew writes. Following the Republican triumphs in the state elections in 2014, forty new voter restrictions were introduced in seventeen states during the first few weeks of 2015 alone. By now, according to the National Council of State Legislatures, a total of thirty-four states have adopted some sort of voter ID law, and as of late March of this year thirty-two such laws were in effect., For years, Republicans were more alert than Democrats to the many opportunities provided by controlling governorships and state legislatures. Right now, the Republicans are in total control of twenty-four states whereas the Democrats have total control of only seven. The lesson seems to be that once Republicans get total power at the state level, they find a way to rig the rules to keep the other sides strongest constituencies from voting., As a strategy for maintaining political power, its both shrewd and cynical, and perhaps worthy of grudging admiration for its effectiveness. But the impact on the integrity and quality of elections threatens the very nature of our democracy. More from Drew:, What is now clear is that the efforts in many states to fix the outcome of the vote by keeping Democratic constituencies from voting have been largely successful. With the white share of the voting population dropping in such swing states as Florida and Nevada, both of which Obama won narrowly in 2012, and North Carolina, which Obama narrowly lost, the Republicans are all the more anxious to hold down the number of black and Latino votes., Laws restricting peoples voting rights will continue to be passed until the pattern becomes too obvious for even the Supreme Court to ignore, or we get a different Supreme Court, or enough people wake up to whats going on and see that democracy is being curtailed. For the time being we cannot expect Congress to help., In fact, we can only help ourselves. But a low sense of political efficacy and a general malaise about the American electoral system suggests we wont. And so the gaming will continue, and the democracy will recede., Follow Scott Martelle on Twitter @smartelle.]", "Date": "20150506", "Title": "[While we focus on candidates, we lose sight of threats to democracy]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-campaigns-voting-rights-democrats-republicans-20150506-story.html", "Author": "[Scott Martelle]"}
{"Content": "[[, Perhaps its just holiday cheer, but a few weeks after his party suffered painful losses in the midterm election, President Obama is ending 2014 with his highest approval ratings of the year., The evidence comes from new polls that show not only rising approval of Obamas performance in office, but also a warming trend in Americans perception of the economy., Its way too soon to claim a major shift. The evidence for more than a year has shown that the vast majority of Americans have strongly held views about Obama and that, as a result, changes in his approval ratings dont last. His ratings have been stuck at a tepid level through most of 2014., But there are a couple of reasons to think that the latest upswing might prove to be the beginning of something lasting., First, the numbers: A CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday showed 48% of Americans approved of Obamas job performance. Although that still leaves him somewhat underwater, its a 20-month high and up 4 percentage points from the previous month., Similarly, Gallups weekly tracking poll put Obamas approval at 45% through Sunday, the highest since May. Gallups more volatile three-day average had Obama at 47% over the weekend, the highest level of the year., Three factors seem to be bolstering Obamas ratings and could carry over into the new year., The most important is the economy, which, except in cases of major wars or scandals, usually exerts the strongest pull on a presidents ratings., Recent economic news has been good, capped by Tuesdays report that the economys growth rate in the third quarter reached 5%., For more than a year, as the economy has warmed up, political analysts have wondered why Obama wasnt getting more credit. One simple explanation is lag time - after a deep recession, history suggests the public needs many months of solid economic growth to feel better about the economy and political leaders., Now, that shift in public opinion may be taking place. The CNN/ORC poll, for example, showed that 51% of Americans said they had a positive view of the economy, compared with 49% who had a negative view. That was the first time a majority in the poll had been positive about the economy in seven years, and a big jump from 38% in October., Other polls have found smaller, though still notable, improvements in how Americans view the economy. Typically, such a shift benefits the incumbent., A second factor may be the impact of some of Obamas policy decisions. His approval rating among Latinos, for example, moved sharply upward after his announcement last month that the administration would seek to shield from deportation several million immigrants in the U.S. without legal authorization., Although many Republicans have denounced the immigration decision, the impact on public opinion was almost all on the plus side for Obama, presumably because the vast majority of those who disapprove already had negative views of his presidency., Finally, Obama has been plagued all year by a sense, even among those who tend to support him, that he is too passive and not a strong leader. The presidents recent spate of executive actions on a broad range of issues, including climate change and relations with Cuba, along with immigration, could be combating that image., Those factors - particularly the economy - could benefit Obama more in the year to come. Thats by no means certain. But if it happens, rising poll numbers for the incumbent would significantly help the Democratic presidential candidate in the 2016 election., The CNN/ORC poll interviewed 1,011 adult Americans on Thursday through Sunday; it has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The Gallup presidential approval numbers are based on approximately 1,500 interviews every three days; that poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points., For more on politics and policy, follow @DavidLauter on Twitter.]", "Date": "20141223", "Title": "[Obama's approval ratings climb as year ends.

{"Content": "[[, Philippine President Benigno Aquino III on Wednesday urged lawmakers to swiftly enact a law granting autonomy to the Muslim region of Mindanao to quell more than 40 years of rebellion that has killed at least 150,000 people., The proposed law is modeled on one that pacified a similar Muslim insurgency in neighboring Indonesias Aceh province in 2005., Aquino asked his political allies who dominate both houses of the legislature to pass the bill as soon as possible to give the region  to be called Bangsamoro, or Moro Nation  time to hold a referendum on the new status and organize local elections to coincide with the next national vote in 2016., The southern island of Mindanao, its Zamboanga Peninsula and nearby Sulu archipelago have been scenes of violent insurgency among the Moro populations since 1970. An Al Qaeda-affiliated extremist group known as Abu Sayyaf carried out kidnappings, beheadings and bombings in a bloody campaign for a separate Islamic state. The group has been tamped down over the last decade to a few hundred militants. U.S.-trained Filipino troops got the upper hand against the most radical insurgents with the aid of some fighters from more moderate Moro factions., The bill submitted by Aquino calls for Bangsamoro to replace the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao created in 1990 but granted more limited powers. The new Muslim state would have its own 60-seat regional parliament, police force, control over its finances, the authority to raise taxes and the right to apply Islamic sharia law to Muslims., The Philippine justice system would continue to apply to non-Muslims in Bangsamoro. Only about 5% of the predominantly Roman Catholic countrys 107 million people are Muslims but they are heavily concentrated in the Mindanao region and the Sulu archipelago., Senate President Franklin Drilon said he would press lawmakers to expedite passage of the bill, and acknowledged that fierce debates were likely en route to what he expected to be eventual approval., \"We are giving ourselves until the first quarter of next year,\" Drilon said, according to the Manila Standard Today report on the bill proposal. \"I dont think we can pass this by the end of the year. We will give it our best shot but its extremely difficult because of the budget debates that come before that.\", The bill now before lawmakers omits provisions for disarming the 11,000 fighters of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, with which Aquino signed a provisional peace agreement in March, the Philippine Star reported., The president nevertheless expressed optimism that the Muslim militia can be transformed into a political force for the autonomous region., \"If we are able to legislate this, we can give our Moro brothers enough time to prepare, thus enabling them to nurture the seeds of meaningful governance which were planted for the Bangsamoro,\" Aquino said in his ceremonial presentation of the bill to legislative leaders., The autonomy plan for the Muslim region was expected to ease concern among the island nations neighbors and allies that festering resentment among the religious minority could be used by extremist groups like Islamic State to recruit new fighters., U.S. military forces pulled out of the Philippines after lawmakers in 1991 refused to extend a defense cooperation agreement.

The government for the most part has blamed the attacks on Uighur separatist groups, which it claims are seeking to create a new homeland called East Turkestan., Uighurs, an Islamic minority, maintain that official policies restricting religious activity and local customs have increased tensions between them and the Han Chinese majority. Advocates for the ethnic group say police have used indiscriminate force against protesters, with the U.S.-based Uighur American Assn. saying police opened fire on a protest against a security crackdown on Muslims during the most recent Ramadan celebrations, killing over 20., Uighurs makes up about 45% of the population in Xinjiang, but vastly outnumber Han Chinese in Shache County, where there is strong resentment against government policies and a growing wave of Chinese migrants., Shache, known as Yarkand in Uighur, was the location of attacks in July that state media said killed 37 people and left 59 identified as assailants dead.

{"Content": "[[, Politically speaking, Sarah Palin is crazy  but in an entertaining way. Speaker of the House John Boehner may look reasonable by comparison, but his supposed rationality is pretty dubious., Before I proceed to pick on these GOP icons, I want to acknowledge that I spend a lot of time blasting Republicans in my columns and cartoons. Many readers assume its because Im a commie-pinko, America-hating liberal Democrat. Actually, my constant critique of todays GOP has more to do with the fact that I grew up in a time and place where Republicans were often the smart, sane ones and quite a few Democrats were part of a regressive, corrupt old guard., Coming from a long-time-Republican family, I leaned toward the GOP in my sympathies and my votes well into my 20s. But those were the days when the word \"Republican\" was not synonymous with conservative and conservative was not synonymous with reactionary, anti-intellectual, gun-worshiping, gay-bashing, immigrant-fearing populism., So, as a lapsed Republican, I am disappointed with the narrowness, rigidity and willful ignorance of those contemporary Republicans who claim the right to brand any Republican who disagrees with them a \"Rino\" (Republican in name only)., Judged by the long history of the party, if anyone is an actual Rino, its Sarah Palin. She has recently confessed as much, revealing an inclination to leave the GOP behind because the party lacks zeal for her list of kooky causes. One cause, in particular, has failed to ignite the passions of party leaders: the impeachment of President Obama., Last week in a column on Breitbart.com, Palin declared, \"Enough is enough of the years of abuse from this president. His unsecured border crisis is the last straw that makes the battered wife say, no mas. \", She wrote that the many impeachable offenses of Barack Obama can no longer be ignored,but failed to clarify what those crimes may be. One of the presidents worst sins, as Palin sees it, is that he has made many Americans feel like strangers in their own country. Setting aside the reality that sweeping demographic, cultural and economic changes are far more likely the cause of traditionalist alienation than anything the president has done, it should be noted that making some folks feel excluded is not an impeachable offense. Imagine how marginalized anti-war liberals felt when George W. Bush was president., Boehner apparently knows that trying to lead an impeachment effort is a fools errand. He dismissed Palins impeachment manifesto with two words: I disagree., Instead, he and the House GOP leadership are taking the president to federal court, saying he has overstepped the limits of his constitutional role. This might seem a saner course of action if not for the political loopiness of the premise on which they are basing their lawsuit. After fighting against Obamas Affordable Care Act for most of the presidents time in office, after taking countless votes to repeal the act and after running in 2010 and 2012 on a platform demanding repeal of the law, the Republicans now want to force the administration to put the law into full effect., Obama has delayed implementation of the employer mandate provision of the ACA twice since 2013. Now, penalties that will punish employers for not providing healthcare coverage to their employees will not kick in until 2016. Boehner contends Obama has usurped the powers of Congress by fiddling with the deadlines., It is an interesting legal question that a court will decide somewhere down the line, but no one is nave enough to believe that constitutional clarity is truly Boehners goal. Republicans hate the mandate as much as they hate the whole healthcare law. The lawsuit is merely a milder version of the impeachment campaign; another gambit in the ceaseless effort to block the Democratic president at every possible turn., This juvenile partisan towel fight has consumed most of the efforts of Republicans for way too long. Immediate action is needed to keep the Highway Trust Fund from running out of money by the end of August. By the end of September, a long list of other bills must be passed to avert another government shutdown. Plus, theres the debate about renewal of the Export-Import Bank and the bill to address the latest border crisis. But all that necessary work may not get done because the House majority is too fixated on undoing the last two presidential elections., For her part, Palin mocks Boehners little ploy. You dont bring a lawsuit to a gunfight and theres no room for lawyers on our front lines, she said, boldly mixing her metaphors on Fox News., These arent real Republicans.

{"Content": "[[, President Obama acknowledged Wednesday that he was disappointed with the wave of losses that Democrats endured in the midterm elections but said he viewed the result as a sign that Americans want change in Washington and want elected officials to \"get stuff done,\" rather than as a repudiation of his policies. ,  Speaking at length to reporters, Obama resisted taking responsibility for the outcome, in contrast to his response to the last midterm elections in 2010, when he admitted his party suffered a \"shellacking., The American people sent a message, one that theyve sent for several elections now: They expect the people they elect to work as hard as they do, he said Wednesday. They expect us to focus on their ambitions and not ours. They want us to get the job done. All of us, in both parties, have a responsibility to address that sentiment., But Obama signaled that he wouldnt adopt a new strategy for dealing with Congress. He repeatedly invited Republicans to work with him but, short of that outcome, said he plans to march ahead on his own a range of issues including reform of the immigration system, climate change and the implementation of his landmark healthcare law. That likely means through executive actions rather than legislation., On immigration, he said he would act before the end of the year, though he would still rather see Congress pass a bill he can sign., If, in fact, there is a great eagerness on the part of Republicans to tackle a broken immigration system, then they have every opportunity to do it, he said. My executive actions not only do not prevent them from passing a law that supersedes those actions, but should be a spur for them to actually try to get something done., Obama has invited congressional leaders to meet with him Friday, and he outlined three issues where he saw a chance for Republicans and Democrats to work together in the lame-duck session of Congress before the year ends: passage of a federal budget, taking on Islamic State militants in the Middle East and the response to the deadly Ebola virus., To that end, he asked Congress on Wednesday for more than $6 billion in emergency funding to beef up the fight against Ebola in the three West African countries it is has ravaged and to monitor the U.S. system for preventing the spread of the deadly virus at home., The request included $4.5 billion for equipping healthcare workers and clinics to fight the Ebola outbreak, while some $1.5 billion would go into a contingency fund to cover future needs. The U.N. has said it will take at least $1 billion to fight the outbreak in West Africa., He also said he would have a top military official brief leading lawmakers about the fight against Islamic State militants, and that he would continue discussions about a new congressional authorization to attack the extremists that is \"right-sized and updated,\" rather than relying on legal authority that Congress granted the president more than a decade ago to fight Al Qaeda., Obama also mentioned certain amendments to his signature healthcare law that hed be willing to accept, possible peace offerings in the hours after Republicans swept key congressional races and set themselves up to take over both chambers of Congress early next year. He said he wouldnt consider major changes like a removal of the provision requiring every person to have health insurance. But he said he would be \"open and receptive\" to ideas for making \"responsible changes.\", The Republican wins in key states coincided with votes in support of raising the minimum wage, giving hope to Obama that he might be able to work on that issue with GOP leaders., White House officials also say Obama will raise the idea with congressional leaders of reforming the corporate tax structure to pay for infrastructure improvements, and that hes open to discussing all the options that might make such a thing palatable to Republicans., Still, hours after a sound defeat for Democrats in gubernatorial and congressional races around the country, the president didnt appear to be contemplating any personal change in response., \"Every election is a moment for reflection,\" he said. \"Everybody in this White House is going to look and say,\"What do we need to do differently? ...But the things that motivate me every single day ...those thingsarent going to change.\", Republicans read the results of the election differently, talking about the perils of overreach during Obamas remaining tenure. In his home state of Kentucky, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said the presidents contemplated action would be like waving a red flag in front of a bull., But McConnell extended an offering of his own, insisting that Republicans would not engage in brinkmanship over the federal debt ceiling as they did in 2011 or consider another government shutdown as they did in 2012., For his part, Obama said he was savoring the possibilities of his remaining time in office, and vowed to work like he is playing the final period of a competitive basketball game. , Obama said he wants to be able to say,\"We played that fourth quarter well., For more White House coverage, follow @cparsons]", "Date": "20141105", "Title": "[Obama acknowledges defeat but recommits to acting without Congress]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-obama-midterm-vote-reaction-20141105-story.html", "Author": "[Christi Parsons]"}
{"Content": "[[, President Obama and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell talked of cooperation Wednesday in the aftermath of the huge GOP election victory, but the two sides prepared for renewed conflict on issues that have dominated the campaign and national debate for the last two years., On immigration, healthcare and global warming, the initial public statements from the two sides, while polite, indicated little flexibility and presaged intense new battles that could begin within weeks., JOIN OUR LIVE DISCUSSION AT NOON PACIFIC TIME, Obama reiterated his promise of executive action this year to protect potentially millions of unauthorized immigrants from deportation; McConnell likened the move, for Republicans, to \"waving a red flag in front of a bull.\", McConnell pledged to undo major parts of Obamas healthcare reform law; the president promised to veto those efforts., And the two sides prepared for confrontation on the proposed Keystone XL pipeline from Canada. That could lead Obama to face an early decision on whether to use his veto or acquiesce and anger a major Democratic constituency  in this case, environmental activists., Speaking to reporters in the East Room of the White House, Obama gave minimal concession to the widespread Republican gains in Tuesdays election, which included winning majority control of the Senate for the first time since 2006., \"Obviously Republicans had a good night,\" he said. Otherwise, he repeatedly deflected suggestions that he bore any personal responsibility for his partys defeat, or that voters had passed a negative judgment on his policies., Obamas words contrasted with his response to the Democrats midterm defeat four years ago. At the time, he described that loss as a \"shellacking.\", The 2010 losses led to a new White House emphasis on deficit reduction and a long, ultimately fruitless effort to reach a \"grand bargain\" with Republicans on taxes and spending., This time, the president gave no sign that he planned any significant change in his priorities or approach during his final two years in office., Both sides sought to convey an air of cordiality, playing down the partisan contentiousness that voters have repeatedly told pollsters they deplore., McConnell, at his own news conference in Louisville, Ky., held shortly before Obamas, repeatedly ruled out two tactics that have proved especially unpopular, saying that Republicans will not engage in brinkmanship over the federal debt ceiling, as they did in 2011, or force another government shutdown, as they did in 2013., Both leaders said they thought they could agree on expanding global trade and cutting corporate taxes, two issues that have been priorities for business groups. Trade policy has pitted the White House against many Democratic members of Congress and interest groups, making it one of the rare areas where the switch to GOP control could help the Obama agenda., But those are comparatively small-bore topics, a fact Obama tacitly conceded, describing them as areas where talks, if successful, might open the way to broader deals., Meantime, the two sides quickly squared off over the same issues they have argued about for years, starting with immigration., \"Its time for us to take care of business,\" Obama said, referring to his vow to issue executive orders if Congress doesnt act. \"I cant wait another two years.\", McConnell warned against unilateral action that \"poisons the well\" for cooperation with Republicans. \"I hope he wont do that,\" he said., Administration officials are preparing a broad package of changes to immigration policy aimed for late November or early December, according to two senior administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations., They are likely to create a program that would allow people in the country illegally to come forward, pay a fee and submit to a background check to apply for a work permit and a temporary reprieve from deportation. It would be similar to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program created in 2012., As many as 5 million people could be eligible for the new program, although the scope of the new deferred action program is still being decided, the officials said. Some officials are pushing to include all parents of children who are U.S. citizens, as well as parents of DACA recipients who have been in the country for several years., Obamas order will also probably narrow the rules given to immigration officials about who should be held for immigration violations and expand the definition of who is eligible for employment visas, the officials said., After initially saying he would act on immigration by the end of the summer, Obama announced in September that he would wait until after this weeks election. At the time, White House officials said they were holding off in deference to Democratic Senate candidates who feared executive action on immigration could imperil their campaigns., In the end, nearly all those embattled Democrats lost their seats anyway, and Obama absorbed the wrath of Latino activists who have denounced him for deporting too many people., McConnell also said the Republican Senate would move to undo at least parts of the 2010 healthcare law, although he also sought to quiet expectations of conservatives that the GOP could achieve total repeal., \"The veto pen is a pretty big thing,\" he said., Republicans will, at minimum, try to repeal the laws new tax on certain medical devices, he said, and will try to strike down the requirement that individuals buy health insurance or pay a fine, which \"people hate.\", Obama said he would veto any effort to repeal the insurance requirement, calling it \"a line I cant cross\" because it would \"undermine the structure of the law.\", But he pointedly did not repeat that statement about the device tax, which several Democratic senators also want to eliminate., As if those two fights arent enough, the two parties also seemed headed for a clash over global warming., Several Republican officials said they would push shortly after the new Congress convenes in January for legislation to end the administrations long-running deliberations over the Keystone pipeline, which is designed to carry oil from the tar sands under Canadas prairies to refineries along the Gulf Coast., Enough Democratic senators support the proposed pipeline that a bill to order it approved would stand a good chance of garnering the 60 votes needed to avoid a filibuster. Obama sidestepped a question on whether he would veto it., But McConnell made it clear that Keystone was only part of a broader agenda., During his campaign in Kentucky, a state that has a long tradition of coal mining, he repeatedly denounced the administrations policies on global warming, which Republicans have labeled a \"war on coal.\", In a not-very-veiled reference to the Environmental Protection Agency, he said Republicans would seek to use budget bills to cut back on \"the bureaucratic strangulation of our economy\" through regulation., \"Look for us to go after those kinds of things through the spending process,\" he said., christi.parsons@latimes.com, david.lauter@latimes.com, Twitter: @cparsons, @DavidLauter, Times staff writer Brian Bennett contributed to this report.]", "Date": "20141105", "Title": "[Obama, McConnell speak of cooperation, but conflict is apparent]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-washington-whats-next-20141106-story.html", "Author": "[Christi Parsons, David Lauter]"}
{"Content": "[[, President Obama called years of racial targeting in Ferguson, Mo., \"oppressive and objectionable and worthy of protest\" but decried the gunfire that left two police officers injured there early Thursday., \"There was no excuse for criminal acts,\" Obama said during an otherwise joke-suffused appearance on ABCs \"Jimmy Kimmel Live.\", \"And whoever fired those shots shouldnt detract from the issue. Theyre criminals. They need to be arrested. And then, what we need to do is to make sure that like-minded, good-spirited people on both sides -- law enforcement who have a terrifically tough job and people who understandably dont want to be stopped and harassed just because of their race -- that were able to work together to try to come up with some good answers.\", \"What we have to make sure of is that the folks who disregard and disrespect the other side, people who resort to violence -- that theyre marginalized,\" he added later., \"They set us all back,\" Kimmel said. \"They do.\", \"But theyre not the majority,\" Obama replied. \"And in the same way that you cant generalize about police officers who do an extraordinarily tough job -- overwhelmingly, they do it professionally -- you cant generalize about protesters who it turns out had some very legitimate grievances.\", Obama called attention to a recent Justice Department report that showed that African American citizens were being stopped disproportionately in Ferguson, much of the time so that the city could benefit financially from the fines assessed against them., \"What was happening in Ferguson,\" Obama said, \"was you had city government telling the Police Department ... Stop more people. We need to raise more money. Folks would get stopped. Theyd get tickets. Then, theyd have to wait in line to pay it, take a day off work. Folks would lose their jobs. In some cases, they were thrown in jail because they didnt have enough money for the fines. And then theyd get fined for that. So there was a whole structure there, according to the Justice Department report, that indicated both racism and just a disregard for what law enforcements supposed to do.\", The president reiterated -- as he did on Saturday during an evocative speech commemorating the 50th anniversary of the beatings of civil rights protesters on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala. -- that progress had been made in race relations, even in troubled areas., \"I said this at Selma: It is not unique, but its also not the norm,\" he said. \"And weve got to constantly, when were thinking about issues of racial progress, or any kind of issue, recognize that things can get better, but theres still more work to do. And we shouldnt be complacent about the very real existence of problems out there. But we shouldnt despair and think nothings changed.\", In his remarks about unrest in Ferguson, Obama sympathized with the two police officers caught in the gunfire Thursday. No one had yet been apprehended, though police searched throughout the day., \"Obviously,\" Obama said, \"we dont yet know what happened. Our thoughts and prayers are with the officers and their families, and thankfully ... theyre going to be OK.\", The appearance on Kimmels show -- Obamas first since 2008 -- was the only public event during the presidents whirlwind visit to Southern California. He landed late Thursday afternoon, visited Kimmels Hollywood set, and then traveled to Santa Monica for a gathering with key fundraisers., The off-the-record nighttime chat at the home of Chris Silbermann, co-founder of the talent agency ICM Partners, and Silbermanns wife, Julia Franz, a television executive producer, cost attendees $33,400 per couple., The gathering is one of the first major Hollywood fundraisers for the Democratic National Committee as it prepares for the 2016 presidential and congressional elections., The presidential visit also spawned the usual traffic complaints, although those were generally limited to the immediate environs of Obamas appearances., Twitter: @finneganLAT; @cathleendecker, ]", "Date": "20150312", "Title": "[Obama on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live': 'No excuse for criminal acts' in Ferguson]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-obama-ferguson-kimmel-20150312-story.html", "Author": "[Michael Finnegan, Cathleen Decker]"}
{"Content": "[[, President Obama declared America ready to turn the page on years of hardship and economic insecurity in a State of the Union address Tuesday night that offered a sprawling, post-recession domestic agenda aimed at appealing to the middle class  and at revitalizing his presidency in its final two years., America, for all that weve endured; for all the grit and hard work required to come back; for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this: The shadow of crisis has passed, and the state of the union is strong, Obama said., It was the first time Obama used the familiar phrase so directly, without qualification or condition, in a State of the Union speech., At times boastful, confident and even cocky, Obama appeared unfazed by his partys electoral pounding in the midterm election less than three months ago or his year of slouching approval ratings. He offered few overtures to the opposition, even interrupting his rhetoric about bipartisan harmony to shoot back a zinger at Republicans., When he noted he has no more campaigns to run, some Republicans cheered. Obama responded with his own dig., I know cause I won both of them, he ad-libbed., Obama declared 2014 a breakthrough year for America, a dramatic shift for a president who has spent his time in office either slogging through grim economic news or pleading for patience for better times ahead. But White House aides argued that the president was ready to move the economic debate past fights over austerity into what he labeled middle-class economics., He outlined a wide-ranging platform to define the term. Obama proposed free community college, expanded child-care tax credits, a new tax benefit for two-income families, a push for paid family leave, and a proposed tax increase on the wealthy to pay for programs the White House says will help a battered middle class participate in the economic turnaround., Obama vowed to improve job training programs, advocated a free and open Internet and issued a blunt challenge to lawmakers who oppose raising the minimum wage., If you truly believe you could work full time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it, he said, with a smile. If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise., Obamas remarks drew a contrast to his political opponents, who are aiming to turn the page from the Obama era to a new one of Republican dominance in Congress., Delivering the partys rebuttal, freshman Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa described Americans as still rattled from the aftershocks of the Great Recession. She squarely blamed the presidents policies, including his landmark healthcare law., We see our neighbors agonize over stagnant wages and lost jobs. We see the hurt caused by canceled healthcare plans and higher monthly insurance bills, she said., Americans have been hurting, but when we demanded solutions, too often Washington responded with the same stale mind-set that led to failed policies like Obamacare. Its a mind-set that gave us political talking points, not serious solutions., Ernst reiterated Republicans promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, known formally as the Affordable Care Act., Obama looked out on a House chamber filled with the first entirely GOP-controlled Congress in nearly a decade and more Republican opponents than at any point in his time in office. Still, he saved his gestures toward compromise and bipartisan outreach for well into his speech  and did not offer any specific olive branch to new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who could determine whether Obama chalks up any more major legislative victories before leaving office., McConnell had little to applaud., The biggest problem is the president made a speech that made it look like hes going to run for office again. His time for running is over. His time for governing is here. And in order to accomplish things over the last two years of the Obama administration, he needs to work with the Republican Congress, McConnell said in a statement., Obama made a broad appeal for a better politics and criticized partisan gotcha moments and fake controversies, but he seemed to do little else to ease the tensions., His speech was not aimed at political centrism. Buoyed by his rising public approval and an improving economy, the president was eager to use the moment to show the public  and Washington  that he wouldnt go quietly, aides said., Obama pledged to veto any measures that would undo his sweeping immigration executive actions or his healthcare law. His tax proposals, which would raise $320 billion in new revenue over a decade, were more likely to frame the upcoming debate than start negotiations on tax reform., After a year of being whipsawed by foreign crises, Obama defended his policies overseas against those who have pushed for more aggressive responses. He cast his choices as a smarter kind of American leadership. The phrase echoed a catchphrase the White House has used before to encapsulate his foreign policy: Dont do stupid stuff., When we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads, when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military  then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world, Obama said in his address. Thats what our enemies want us to do., He defended the ongoing multinational nuclear negotiations with Iran and restated his promise to veto proposed legislation that threatened additional sanctions against Tehran. He touted his plans to open up U.S. policy toward Cuba, urging Congress to end the half-century trade embargo as Alan Gross, the imprisoned American aid worker freed recently after five years in a Cuban prison, looked on from the balcony., Some Republicans answered the White Houses symbolism with their own, inviting Cuban democracy activists as guests., Even as Republicans in Congress refuse to allow the transfer of Guantanamo Bay detainees to prisons inside the U.S., Obama affirmed his belief that the United States should go beyond its dramatic reduction in the number of detainees at the U.S. military prison in Cuba and close it altogether, as he promised he would do shortly after he took office in 2009., Obama cast the U.S.-led coalition battling Islamic State extremists in Iraq and Syria as strong and urged patience. He vowed to work with Congress to rewrite the law for use of force that has authorized the air campaign already underway., Senior administration officials described updating that law as the presidents top legislative priority., Another focus is likely to be passing a key trade deal, which would require Obama to persuade his own party to join the effort. To that end, he made a rare appeal aimed at the Democratic base., Look, Im the first one to admit that past trade deals havent always lived up to the hype, and thats why weve gone after countries that break the rules at our expense. But 95% of the worlds customers live outside our borders, and we cant close ourselves off from those opportunities, he said., Obama offered measured remarks on two of the controversies that consumed part of the last year. First, he made a plea for criminal justice reform in the wake of the debate over race and policing that followed the unrest in Ferguson, Mo., and in New York City after white police officers killed unarmed black men, and grand juries declined to indict either officer., People may have different takes on the events, but surely we can understand a father who fears his son cant walk home without being harassed, he said. Surely we can understand the wife who wont rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift., Similarly, on the debate over the balance between free speech and anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim messages that erupted after the terrorist attacks this month on the French magazine Charlie Hebdo, Obama appealed for understanding., As Americans, we respect human dignity, even when were threatened, he said., In the end, though, he returned to the heart of his message, an economic policy aimed at strengthening the middle class., The country has recovered from hardship, he said, remaking itself like a family that suffers but works toward a better day., Weve laid a new foundation, he said.

But he warned that opponents were already offering upshaky information that recalled the policies and mindset that failed us in the past., Some of the same politicians and pundits that are so quick to reject the possibility of a diplomatic solution to Irans nuclear program are the same folks who were so quick to go to war in Iraq and said it would take a few months, he said. We know the consequences of that choice, and what it cost us in blood and treasure. So I believe theres a smarter, more responsible way to protect our national security., Obama vowed a vigorous effort to make sure that people know the facts, detailing some aspects of the deal while also offering a broader defense of his policy of engagement., Instead of chest-beating that rejects the idea of even talking to our adversaries, which sometimes sounds good in sound bites but accomplishes nothing, were seeing that strong and principled diplomacy can give hope of actually resolving a problem peacefully, he said. Instead of rushing into another conflict, I believe that sending our sons and daughters into harms way must always be a last resort, and that before we put their lives on the line we should exhaust every alternative., That is what we owe our troops. That is strength, and American leadership, he added., As Obama prepared to speak to the veterans group, the White House launched new efforts to sway the debate, including a Twitter account, @TheIranDeal. Secretary of State John F. Kerry and other officials are scheduled to testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday in the first public hearing on the proposal, a day after the administration holds classified briefings for the full House and Senate., In his remarks in Pittsburgh, Obama also mourned the five victims of a shooting rampage targeting military personnel in Chattanooga last week as American heroes., We draw strength from yet another American community that has come together with an unmistakable message to those who would try to do us harm: We will not give into fear, you can not divide Americans. You can never change our way of life or the values of freedom and diversity that make us Americans, he said., Though the president said the full nature of the attack was still unknown, he noted that Al Qaeda and Islamic State have encouraged similar activities, and he warned that lone wolf attacks are hard to prevent., Our entire government, along with state and local partners -- we are going to keep doing everything in our power to protect the American people, including our men and women in uniform, he said., Follow @mikememoli for more news out of Washington, ALSO:, Explainer: What the Iran nuclear agreement means, The talking -- and arguing -- points of the Iran nuclear deal, Op-Ed: Opposition to Iran deal makes for some strange bedfellows]", "Date": "20150721", "Title": "[Obama: Critics of Iran deal are the same people who rushed to war with Iraq]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-obama-iran-vfw-20150721-story.html", "Author": "[Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, President Obama has made the steady withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan a top priority for his second term, but his decision Tuesday to change course and slow the drawdown reflects a renewed concern about terrorism threats and a clear rapport with the new president after years of friction with his predecessor., The administration had planned to cut the U.S. military force to about 5,500 troops this year as part of a phased withdrawal. But Obama says he now plans to keep the current force of 9,800 troops there through the end of the year, although he still plans to end Americas longest war before he leaves office., At a White House news conference with President Ashraf Ghani, Obama said he hasnt changed his plan to shrink the U.S. force in Afghanistan to a limited security and military aid mission, with several hundred military personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul late next year. He said the specific trajectory of that drawdown will be set this year., The deadline for the normalization of our presence in Afghanistan remains the end of 2016, Obama said. That hasnt changed. Our transition out of a combat role has not changed., But he said he had decided to leave all U.S. troops in place this year to help Afghan forces succeed so we dont have to go back, so we dont have to respond in an emergency because terrorist activities are being launched from Afghanistan., The U.S.-led invasion in late 2001 was aimed at eradicating a sanctuary for Al Qaeda, the terrorist network that launched the Sept. 11 attacks, and oust the Taliban from power. It proved relatively easy to topple the Taliban, but difficult over the next 14 years to pacify or unify a poverty-stricken country ruled by warlords., About 850,000 U.S. troops deployed to Afghanistan, and 2,215 died there, but the Taliban insurgency remains very much alive., Afghan security forces took over primary responsibility for combat operations last year. Since then, more than 9,000 troops and police have been killed in action, a casualty level that a senior U.S. general in November called unsustainable., The Afghan army managed to hold off insurgent attempts to recapture major towns in the south last year, but it still has large gaps that will take years to fill, including the need to build an air force and the capability to keep units supplied in the field, U.S. commanders say., Its unclear whether Obama will reconsider his plan to remove all but a token U.S. force next year. Although he has frequently announced his desire to end U.S. involvement in the two wars he inherited, some experts warn that a complete pullout of American troops could leave Afghanistan vulnerable to the kind of bloodletting that has engulfed Iraq in the last year., After the 2011 withdrawal of U.S. troops, Iraq faced growing sectarian turmoil and much of its U.S.-trained military collapsed when Islamic State militants swept in from Syria and seized about a third of the country last year. The group recently claimed a franchise in Afghanistan., Obama, however, made it clear that security was not the only issue on his mind. He said he agreed to slow the U.S. pullout in part because of the reinvigorated partnership with Afghanistan and the need to secure the countrys fragile national unity government and political reforms after years of instability., Ghani, a U.S.-educated technocrat who worked for 15 years at the World Bank in Washington, replaced Hamid Karzai, who often was harshly critical of U.S. policies and tactics even as American troops were fighting and dying in his country., Karzais refusal to approve a bilateral security agreement necessary to keep U.S. troops in Afghanistan left relations with the White House in tatters last year. Ghani made signing the accord one of his first official acts after his election in the countrys first peaceful and democratic transition of power last fall., Ghanis three-day visit to Washington this week highlighted the warm new relationship. He was issued a rare invitation to the presidential retreat at Camp David, and spent Monday huddling there with Secretary of State John F. Kerry, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, CIA Director John O. Brennan, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper and other senior officials., He also stopped by the Pentagon to publicly thank U.S. troops who had served in Afghanistan, a gesture Karzai had declined., Due to desertions and casualties, the Afghan army and police now number around 330,000, well below the mandated level of 352,000., One of Ghanis goals for his U.S. visit has been to secure promises from the White House and Congress to continue military aid to his cash-strapped government at or near the roughly $4 billion that has been provided in recent years. Obama pledged his support at the news conference., Standing together in the East Room, Obama introduced Ghani as a fellow alumnus of Columbia University and an anthropologist, as was my mother. Responding in English, Ghani complimented Obamas national security team for going out of its way to engage with his government., Tragedy brought us together, he said to Obama. Interests now unite us., He vowed that his government will speak truth to terror., Most U.S. troops no longer engage in ground combat in Afghanistan and are confined to bases as trainers and advisors. But about 2,500 U.S. special operations troops still carry out attacks on the remnants of Al Qaeda and its allies., Obamas new timetable pushes back the start of the final troop withdrawal to next year and allows the continued operation of several bases that are used by U.S. forces to resupply Afghan units and provide them with emergency air support., In his comments Tuesday, Obama didnt rule out the idea that his future decisions about troop levels will depend on the situation., Anthony H. Cordesman, a national security analyst at the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the fall of a major Afghan city to insurgents could change the White House calculus on how quickly to pull out., Predicting the outcome of the fighting this year, and for that matter next year, is not something you can easily do, said Cordesman, author of the new book Afghanistan at Transition., Obama has come under growing pressure to ease back on his drawdown, or at least to leave the decision to the next occupant in the White House., Republicans have long pushed him to abandon the schedule. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said Tuesday that Obama shouldnt be dictating policy preferences divorced from security realities., But a group of former U.S. foreign policy and defense officials, including several who served in senior positions in Obamas administration, also urged the president in a letter released Tuesday to reconsider his goal of removing U.S. forces from Afghanistan by the end of 2016., The letter,whose signers included former Undersecretary of Defense Michele Flournoy and the former NATO commander, retired Adm. James Stavridis, called on Obama to reassess our withdrawal timeline and to look at the U.S. military and intelligence posture necessary in Afghanistan after 2016 to protect the United States homeland and U.S. interests overseas from enduring terrorist threats in the region., In May, Obama outlined a plan to gradually halve the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan to around 5,500 by the end of 2015., The force under that plan would be consolidated in Kabul and at Bagram air base, north of the capital. Joint bases in the strategically important cities of Kandahar and Jalalabad would be closed. Except for a small force at the embassy, most U.S. troops would leave by the end of 2016., But Ghani and senior U.S. commanders have urged the White House to delay the withdrawal, arguing the full U.S. force  and the operations at the two joint bases  is needed to help the Afghan army and police get through the summer and early fall, when insurgent attacks are the highest., Gen. John Campbell, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, told Congress last month that the withdrawal of half his forces this year could potentially take our eye off training and advising Afghan security forces when we really need it., Campbell said the Taliban is not likely to defeat the Afghan army in the field but remains a resilient, lethal force.

{"Content": "[[, President Obama has talked about the deadly dogma infiltrating some Muslim communities and decried the acts of terrorism carried out in the name of what he calls a \"distorted\" version of Islam., But as he presides over three days of discussions at the White House about the fight against terrorism, he and his staff are studiously avoiding making their efforts sound like a religiously driven campaign against the faith of more than 1 billion people., Officially, the meeting is a summit on countering violent extremism. Nobody at the White House is talking about \"Islamic extremism\" or \"Muslim terrorists,\" a semantic distinction that has critics up in arms but that the administration contends is necessary to deprive extremist groups of the authenticity they crave., \"We must never accept the premise that they put forward because it is a lie,\" Obama said in an address at the summit Wednesday. \"They are not religious leaders. They are terrorists. And we are not at war with Islam. We are at war with people who have perverted Islam.\", More than 13 years after the Sept. 11 attacks, U.S. officials are still trying to speak fluently when talking about stateless enemies who cite Islam as their inspiration for terrorism. President George W. Bush talked briefly about \"Islamofascism,\" but it fell out of use amid the protests of Arab leaders., Republicans accuse Obama of tiptoeing around the issue out of an apparent reluctance to offend Muslims. And the question of how to define adversaries is certain to be posed to candidates in the 2016 presidential election., Bush and Obama have tried to balance three goals with their rhetoric: defining 21st century foes to build support for the fight among lawmakers and the public; bringing and keeping Muslim nations on board as partners in preventing the spread of violence and extremism; and avoiding alienating Muslims in the U.S. and elsewhere., Those competing priorities were seen in recent weeks when Obama used the word \"randomly\" in describing the attack on a kosher deli in Paris last month, which some seized on as evidence of his refusal to acknowledge the anti-Semitic motivations in the killings. He was also tweaked for his remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast this month about the Christian role in the Crusades., \"They wont even call the threat what it is. How can you talk about defeating an enemy you cannot name?\" said House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican., The White House said it was not limiting its discussion to groups that identify as Muslim but acknowledged that the recent spate of attacks had been by perpetrators promoting a \"warped\" interpretation of Islam., \"They need for this to be a war between the United States and Islam, for people to believe that they are religious figures and not just terrorists,\" deputy national security advisor Ben Rhodes said. \"We dont want to grant them that legitimacy.\", But deadly homegrown attacks this year in Europe and a video that surfaced this week of beheadings of Egyptian Christians in Libya by the Islamic State gave renewed urgency to the Wests response to terrorists who say they are acting in the name of Islam., James K. Glassman, who led the State Departments public diplomacy efforts at the end of the Bush administration, says he sees both similarities and differences in how the two presidents talked about fighting extremism., Like the current administration, Bush officials were mindful of linking terrorist ideologies too closely to the religious precepts of Islam and also used the phrase \"countering violent extremism\" to describe the challenge., \"We were very sensitive to that,\" said Glassman, a co-chair at the Bipartisan Policy Center. \"But it wasnt that we were worried about offending anybody. It was just more accurate.\", The ideology fueling the Islamic State appears to be a twisted version of centuries-old interpretations of the prophet Muhammad, he said, bearing little resemblance to contemporary Islam. The Obama administration should spend time understanding and articulating that, Glassman said., But that is where he sees the administration as coming late to the game. Unlike Bush, Obama and his top officials have appeared uncomfortable setting up the fight against terrorism as a \"war of ideas,\" Glassman said., \"The way President Bush put it was usually in terms of freedom and democracy. We need to stand up for those values, and democracy is for everybody,\" Glassman said. \"I just dont hear that from this administration. I think there is a discomfort with the notion that our ideas are in some ways superior to other peoples ideas and a discomfort with the notion of marshaling ideas and sending them into battle.\", Obama called Wednesday for a broader international effort to prevent alienated young people from taking up terrorist causes, including that of the Islamic State., \"This isnt our challenge alone. Its a challenge for the world.  Given the complexities of the challenge and the nature of the enemy, which is not a traditional army, this work takes time and will require vigilance and resilience and perspective,\" Obama said., For their part, Muslim groups worried that the conference would target their communities and their beliefs as the source of the problem., \"Associating violence and extremism with Islam, such as Islamic extremism or Islamic terrorism, is very dangerous, because it will put the U.S. and the West at odds with 1.7 billion Muslims around the world,\" said Radwan Masmoudi, president of the Center for the Study of Islam and Democracy. \"The overwhelming majority of them are against violence and extremism. This is exactly what the extremists want  portraying it as a war between Islam and the West  and it would be catastrophic to fall into this trap.\", In a rare departure from citing only peaceful Muslim voices, the White House pointed Wednesday to a letter from a secret trove written by the most hunted terrorist of all time  Osama bin Laden., Shortly before he was killed by U.S. special forces in 2011, Bin Laden wrote to co-conspirators arguing that they were losing the propaganda war by letting their full name, Al Qaeda al-Jihad, be shortened, thus losing the religious element, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest recalled., Bin Ladens letter lamented that the branding problem allowed the West to claim that they were not at war with Islam, Earnest said., But \"this is not a religious war,\" Earnest said. \"This is not a war on Islam.\", kathleen.hennessey@latimes.com, christi.parsons@latimes.com]", "Date": "20150219", "Title": "[At summit on extremism, Obama defends his semantic choices regarding Islam]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-obama-extremism-language-20150219-story.html", "Author": "[Kathleen Hennessey, Christi Parsons]"}
{"Content": "[[, President Obama inserted himself deeply into the election season from this remote locale on Monday, blasting the political rhetoric of Republican presidential candidates and what he called a culture of outrageous attacks tolerated by the GOP., He singled out the weekend charge from White House hopeful and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who said that through the proposed international nuclear deal with Iran, Obama will take the Israelis and basically march them to the door of the oven. The president called Huckabees stark comparison to the Holocaust part of a general patternthat would be considered ridiculous if it werent so sad., Weve had a sitting senator call John Kerry Pontius Pilate. Weve had a sitting senator who also happens to be running for president suggest that Im the leading state sponsor of terrorism, Obama said, referring to Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ted Cruz of Texas, respectively. These are leaders in the Republican Party., TRAIL GUIDE: Daily tour through the wilds of the 2016 presidential campaign >>, Obama has remained tight-lipped about the back-and-forth within the Republican presidential field until now, but the question about Huckabee during a news conference here unleashed a flood of sentiment that made clear he has been closely following this early stage of next years election., With his indictment of candidates and party leaders in the middle of his five-day trip to Africa, he waded into the campaign conversation and suggested that he is doing so out of concern about who will succeed him., Republican leaders are shocked, Obama said, when tycoon Donald Trump, whos leading the GOP field in polls, questions the heroism of Republican Sen. John McCain, a prisoner of war in Vietnam. Yet that arises out of a culture where those kinds of outrageous attacks have become far too commonplace and get circulated nonstop through the Internet and talk radio and news outlets, the president said., But, the president said, when he is attacked, the people who were outraged on McCains behalf are pretty quiet., Huckabee may have simply been trying to push Trump out of the headlines, Obama said, adding that that doesnt reflect positively on his leadership., The rumination was part of an Obama pattern of late. He has shown more comfort in speaking frankly, whether it be reflections on his own performance in office, or the controversy surrounding Bill Cosby as dozens of women have come forward with rape accusations., Just a week ago, at a news conference to discuss the Iran deal, Obama flatly refused to respond to a question about Trump. The uptick in rhetoric from the crowded Republican field of 16 candidates, who have in recent days sought to draw attention through viral videos and other stunts, perhaps prompted a change of heart., Huckabee seized on Obamas comments, replying in a statement from his campaign that Obama underestimates Iran., \"Whats ridiculous and sad is that President Obama does not take Irans repeated threats seriously, Huckabee said., Personal attacks dont help voters, Obama said at the news conference., Part of what has made America great, he said, is a recognition that these issues are too serious, that issues of war and peace are of such grave concern and consequence ... that we dont play fast and loose that way. ... We have robust debates ... but we just dont fling out ad hominem attacks that way, because it doesnt help inform the American people., In 18 months, he said, Im turning over the keys, and would like to make sure Im turning over the keys to somebody who is serious., That requires on both sides, Democratic and Republican, a sense of seriousness and decorum and honesty., For more White House coverage, follow@cparsons, ALSO:, Clinton says she did not send classified information over private email system, Question for governors: Why should you be president when your own constituents dont like you?, At Texas-Mexico border, Donald Trump cites great danger from immigrants, 7:54 a.m.: This article has been updated with Huckabees response., This article was originally published at 6:31 a.m.]", "Date": "20150727", "Title": "[Obama: Huckabee's 'oven' comment shows pattern of GOP's 'outrageous attacks']", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-obama-huckabee-republicans-20150727-story.html", "Author": "[Christi Parsons]"}
{"Content": "[[, President Obama launched an effort Thursday to frame the 2016 presidential election on his terms, urging voters to be wary of Republicans who would reverse economic progress that his administration has fought hard to achieve., Obama visited Wisconsin to tout his new rules on overtime pay and took several jabs at Republicans, including Gov. Scott Walker, one of what he called a bus full of aspirants for his office., Ive lost count how many Republicans are running for this job. Theyll have enough for an actual Hunger Games, he joked., Obamas remarks were his first extended public foray into next years election, a race that already has drawn 14 announced Republican candidates, with two more  including Walker  expected to join this month., Despite Republicans rhetoric intended to cast them as on the side of the middle class, Obama said, they support a return to the policies that led the nation into economic crisis. Recalling the Republican warnings that his administrations actions on healthcare, taxes and other issues would lead to economic misery, he cited Thursdays jobs report and its 5.3% unemployment rate as part of what he called a record streak of private-sector job growth., This is progress. Step by step, America is moving forward, Obama said. The question we have to keep asking ourselves is, where do we go from here? Because we still have choices., One thing that the bus full of people who are fighting to lead the Republican ticket all share is they keep on coming up with the same old trickle-down, youre-on-your-own economics that helped bring about the crisis back in 2007-2008 in the first place, he said., Obama and Walker exchanged a cordial greeting after the president stepped off Air Force One en route to his event in La Crosse, a small western Wisconsin city across the Mississippi River from Minnesota., The president has been sharply critical of the governors record, including releasing a pointed statement after the Wisconsin Legislature passed a so-called right-to-work bill in March. The legislation, which curbs the clout of private-sector unions, became a Walker priority four years after his successful drive to end collective bargaining rights for most public-sector unions. The earlier move triggered a failed recall campaign to oust Walker., On Thursday, Obama contrasted Wisconsins economic fortunes with those of Minnesota, where Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton takes a different approach. As Walker has fought organized labor and cut education funding, Obama said, Dayton has expanded Medicaid, raised the minimum wage, and raised tax rates for the highest earners., Now, according to the Republican theory, all of those steps would have been bad for the economy. But Minnesotas unemployment rate is lower than Wisconsin; Minnesotas median income is around $9,000 higher, Obama said. Its a pretty interesting experiment., Walker took a different tack in a recent op-ed. Wisconsin has enjoyed a dramatic recovery, he wrote, in spite of  not because of  the presidents big-government policies., Obama also spoke at length about his overtime proposal, which he says will give 5 million middle-class workers a raise. The president instructed the Labor Department last year  which he called his year of action  to rewrite the rules governing eligibility for overtime pay. The new rules seek to expand the pool of salaried workers who automatically are eligible for higher pay for overtime work., Under the authority already granted to the Labor Department through the Fair Labor Standards Act, the administration will more than double, to $50,440 a year, the minimum salary threshold that guarantees higher compensation for salaried employees who work more than 40 hours a week., The move is among the most significant Obama has made to address growing income inequality, which has become the driving force of his partys progressive wing., Its one of the single most important steps we can take to help grow middle-class wages, the president said., The action has cheered progressive allies who have bitterly opposed the president over trade in recent weeks. It also has served as a useful signal to Obamas fellow Democrats that for all the harsh words and bruised egos, theyre in agreement more often than not., It is a reminder to people in the labor movement that this president does have his eye on working families and does care about them, said Rep. Mark Takano (D-Riverside), who has been a leading advocate of the overtime change. This is a very unifying move the administration is taking., Such a change, Takano said, had become a cause celebre within the House Progressive Caucus, and he called it a very bold step., Im glad that he has discovered his footing on this issue, Takano said. And Im going to do all I can in Congress to make sure we provide the president with the support to make sure this happens., Republicans who helped secure Obamas trade victory last week criticized his move on overtime, saying the steps he was taking to try to boost middle-class pay would only hurt job creation., Democratic Rep. Ron Kind, who represents La Crosse and helped lead a group of moderate Democrats supporting the trade bill, said only that he was looking forward to working with the administration on this [overtime] proposal as it moves forward., michael.memoli@latimes.com, 6:41 p.m.: The story was updated throughout with new details., 2:19 p.m.: The story was updated with Obamas comments., The story was originally published at 6:02 a.m.]", "Date": "20150702", "Title": "[Obama warns against the 'you're-on-your-own economics' of 2016 Republican candidates]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-obama-wisconsin-overtime-rules-20150702-story.html", "Author": "[Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, President Obama proposed tougher regulations on investment brokers who handle retirement funds, saying it is time to curb hidden fees, \"backdoor\" payments and conflicts of interest that can cost middle-class Americans tens of thousands of dollars in retirement savings., Diving into another likely clash with a Republican-led Congress, Obama on Monday billed his proposed rules  a revival of an effort quashed amid industry opposition four years ago  as part of his renewed focus on a populist economic message., He dished out tough criticism of financial advisors who are \"bilking\" clients for their own benefit and selling \"snake oil.\" He delivered the message while standing with consumer advocates, retirees and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a favorite among liberals for her efforts to reform the financial system., \"Weve got a lot more work to do to make sure the recovery reaches every single American out there and not just those at the top,\" Obama said in remarks delivered at the headquarters of seniors advocacy group AARP., The proposed rules, which the administration can enact without congressional approval, would require some financial advisors to act as what the law calls fiduciaries for their clients. That would require them to put the clients interests ahead of other factors, such as their own compensation or company profits, when recommending or selling investments., The reforms, long backed by many consumer groups, are designed to crack down on advisors who steer investors to products that provide hidden payments or generate higher fees for the advisor but do not necessarily provide the best returns., Currently, advisors are required to recommend \"suitable\" investments for clients, but that standard leaves considerable room for abuses, according to consumer advocates., A report released Monday by Obamas Council of Economic Advisors estimated that investors receiving \"conflicted advice\" earn lower returns  by roughly 1 percentage point a year  than other investors., That adds up to roughly $17 billion in lost returns in individual retirement accounts each year, the report said. Over time, the losses can build to tens of thousands of dollars for the average worker., Financial services industry officials disputed those estimates and said new rules would require changes to their compensation structure that would undermine their business model. Professional guidance would become more expensive and out of reach for average investors, they warned., \"Middle- and lower-market investors would have a hard time finding wealth managers willing to work with them, and they would be left without any professional guidance to secure their financial future,\" said Jules Gaudreau, president-elect of the National Assn. of Insurance and Financial Advisors., The Department of Labor proposed similar regulations in 2010, only to back off after strong industry pushback and criticism from lawmakers in both parties. Opponents argued that rules as written would have inadvertently prevented investors from receiving important advice and would have dictated how firms could compensate their employees., Labor Secretary Thomas Perez promised in his confirmation hearings to take industry concerns into account when redrafting the regulations. Officials said the new version includes exemptions aimed at addressing those concerns., They did not detail the exemptions, which are certain to be debated during in the coming rule-making process. The new rule would not prohibit revenue-sharing or commissions, nor would it dictate how firms pay their advisors, officials said., The White House said the new higher standards would not apply to advisors providing \"general education\" about employer-sponsored retirement plans and IRAs., Obama said he believed that the majority of advisors try to give their customers good advice. But he cast some of the financial industrys complaints as overblown. Rules governing retirement investing are decades old and in need of updating, he said., Input from Wall Street will be welcome during the process of writing a final version of the regulation, he said, but \"what I wont accept is the notion that theres nothing we can do.\", \"These industry doomsday predictions have not come true in other countries that have taken even more aggressive action on this issue than were proposing,\" Obama said. \"And if your business model rests on taking advantage, bilking hardworking Americans out of their retirement money, then you shouldnt be in business.\", The tough talk came from a president trying to burnish his record on financial regulation as the clock ticks down on his tenure., The White House enlisted Warrens advice on this and other economic proposals  making a relatively rare attempt to win the public approval of an advocate who is beloved by many Democrat liberals, but not so much by Wall Street. The event was the first public appearance for Obama and Warren since a ceremony at the White House last June, when the president endorsed the senators legislative proposal on student loans., Warren more recently frustrated the White House by opposing the nomination of investment banker Antonio Weiss for a top post at the Treasury Department. Weiss withdrew, but was then brought into the department as counselor to Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, a post that does not require Senate confirmation., As Obama tries to build momentum behind his partys economic message  and his legacy  the White House is showing its willingness to cooperate with Warren. Obamas top domestic policy advisor, Cecilia Munoz, recently met with the senator to discuss the proposal on retirement funds, as well as measures on community colleges and student loans, a White House official said., The Massachusetts Democrat, whom some liberals would like to see as a challenger to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the presidential nomination, also has been in touch with Obamas economic advisor, Jeff Zients, and Perez on minimum wage and equal pay issues, the official said., The announcement of the tougher regulations comes as Republicans are preparing to outline their top economic proposals in a budget. Officials said the president will try to draw a stark contrast in the coming weeks by making announcements about proposals they say will boost wages, make college more affordable and protect consumers., kathleen.hennessey@latimes.com, Times staff writer Dean Starkman in New York contributed to this report.]", "Date": "20150223", "Title": "[Obama proposes tougher rules for retirement fund advice]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-obama-retirement-funds-20150224-story.html", "Author": "[Kathleen Hennessey]"}
{"Content": "[[, President Obama released a $4-trillion budget Monday with liberal priorities that have little chance of passage but will serve as an initial foray in negotiations with the new Republican Congress and help define the Democratic Party in the run-up to the 2016 presidential race., The administrations annual federal budget, like those that will follow from the House and Senate, is a largely aspirational blueprint, even more so in Obamas final term. This budget, ending in September 2016, is the last one the president will still be in office to fully execute., There are several factors working in his favor this year, including a strengthening economy, a falling deficit and rising public approval of the administration., The presidents budget focuses on bolstering the federal governments role in shaping opportunities for ordinary Americans, an effort hes dubbed middle-class economics. With deficits projected to be the lowest since he took office, Obama proposes reversing $74 billion in so-called sequestration cuts to government programs that the White House and Congress reluctantly agreed to almost four years ago., The White House also announced a $478-billion public-works program to fund new roads, bridges and highways, paid for by a one-time tax on corporate profits held overseas. That idea has some bipartisan support., More broadly, however, the president intends to champion liberal ideas that are designed to narrow the nations income inequality, asking the biggest financial corporations and wealthiest Americans to shoulder a larger tax burden to help the government provide basics like universal preschool and free community college., Revenue would be raised from new taxes, including one on the nations 50 largest financial firms and others aimed at inheritance and trust funds. That would help pay for tax breaks for middle-class households, including a $500 second-earner tax credit, expansions of both the college tuition credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit, and additional tax credits of up to $3,000 per child., An administration official said 44 million households would see their taxes cut by an average of $600 a year., We believe that this budget shows how we can implement the presidents vision for middle-class economics and put the good of middle-class families and our economy front and center, while also continuing progress on restoring fiscal discipline, the official said. You dont have to choose between those two things. You can in fact accomplish both., Obamas budget details $3.99 trillion in spending and collects $3.52 trillion in revenue, running a deficit of $474 billion, the official said., Even before the budgets release, its contours were quickly dismissed by Republicans in Congress, who see little reason to yield to the White House after expanding their ranks in the last election to control both chambers of Congress., What I think the president is trying to do here is to, again, exploit envy economics, said Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) on NBCs Meet the Press on Sunday. This top-down redistribution doesnt work. Weve been doing it for six years., For Republicans, new taxes are generally a nonstarter, even as a trade-off for reversing Pentagon cuts that many GOP defense hawks warn are hurting military readiness at a time of increased threats from abroad., Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, calls the sequestration cuts mindlessness  a word the White House also uses. But he also declared Obamas proposed tax increases DOA., The president defended his plan in an interview with NBC before the Super Bowl. My job is to present the right ideas, and if the Republicans think they have better ideas, then they should present them. But my job is not to trim my sails, he said., The Republican preference is for continued austerity and lower taxes, which will probably be reflected in their own budget plans expected next month. To boost Pentagon spending as defense hawks want, their budgets are expected to slash more deeply into food stamps, healthcare and other safety-net programs., Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), the House Budget Committee chairman, promised Sunday on Fox News that a Republican budget would re-imagine Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, and will do what the American people have to do with their homes and in their businesses every single day  and thats not spend more money than what comes in., Republicans contend this combination of lower taxes and reduced spending will cut the nations still-climbing $18-trillion debt load and trigger greater growth through private investment., The president thinks that we get economic growth from an ever-bigger government, and thats exactly backward, said Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.), who led the conservative Club for Growth before joining the Senate. We cannot abandon fiscal discipline. There are individual areas that we need to look at very closely, but overall we need to maintain the fiscal discipline we have. It is the way weve managed to make some progress on deficits, but we are not out of the woods by any stretch of the imagination., At some point, though, the heady debates will bump into the practical reality of governing. Built-in deadlines will force both sides to the negotiating table this year, or set the federal government on a trajectory of shutdown threats that have permeated the last few years., On May 31, the authority to spend the Highway Trust Fund expires, which could leave countless road and highway projects in the lurch., Obamas proposal would extend the fund for the next six years by imposing a one-time tax on some $2 trillion in corporate overseas earnings that now largely escape taxation., His proposed 14% tax on foreign profits would be much lower than the standard 35% corporate rate  among the highest of the worlds major economies  and would raise $238 billion, the administration official said, about half the money needed to pay for the infrastructure program. The remainder would be covered by gasoline taxes currently in the trust fund., A similar overseas profits tax, at 6.5%, has been proposed by an unusual bipartisan alliance of Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.), showing the potential for an eventual compromise., With the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1, the full force of the sequestration cuts will begin, and Obamas proposal to prevent them from slicing across domestic and defense accounts will be attractive to Republicans who want to beef up military spending., Another pressure point, coming later this year, will be the need for Congress to raise the federal debt limit., Although deficits have declined steadily, Obamas budget projects a shortfall thats up slightly from current deficit projections. But at roughly 2.5% of gross domestic product, the shortfall is just below the 50-year average for deficits as a share of the economy., That deficit-reduction package nevertheless contained some wishful thinking from the White House. Much of it comes from three areas  lower healthcare spending, higher revenue from closing loopholes and changes to the tax system, and an overhaul of the immigration system. Prospects for the latter two passing the Republican-controlled Congress remain grim., The budget does not reflect the effects of Obamas recent executive actions on deferring deportation for some immigrants, officials said, arguing that the presidents preferred policy was to pass broader immigration legislation., Likewise, the presidents budget makes only a modest dent in the debt. Overall debt is now $18 trillion, and officials said the publicly held portion would come in at 75% of gross domestic product in 2016. Thats more than double what it was in 2007., As they have in the past, Republicans in Congress are likely to demand something in exchange from the White House for their votes to raise the debt limit. That may open the door to talks as a way to avert a crisis., lisa.mascaro@latimes.com, kathleen.hennessey@latimes.com, Twitter: @lisamascaro, Twitter: @khennessey, 9:29 a.m.: This article was updated with more details on the budget., 3 a.m.: This article was updated throughout with new information., 2:30 p.m. Sunday: This article has been updated throughout with additional details and background concerning the budget proposal., This article was originally published at 11:10 a.m. Sunday.]", "Date": "20150202", "Title": "[Obama's $4-trillion budget champions liberal priorities]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-obama-budget-infrastructure-20150201-story.html", "Author": "[Lisa Mascaro, Kathleen Hennessey]"}
{"Content": "[[, President Obama returned from a tranquil vacation Sunday to stare down an end-of-the-year stretch that promises either to cement some of his biggest remaining goals  or hasten the arrival of dreaded irrelevance., Obama has talked often of his desire to finish the last two years of his presidency strongly, notching accomplishments until his last day in office in January 2017. In reality, the congressional and political calendars give him a narrower time frame to act, before the distractionsand pressures of the 2016 election encroach on Washington., To that end, hes packed his post-vacation schedule with trips and invited high-wattage guests to the White House to draw attention to a top-level priority, his fight on climate change  starting with a jaunt next week to Alaska, where hell become the first sitting U.S. president to visit the states Arctic region and meet with hunters and fishermen whose livelihoods are threatened by global warming., Then hell welcome both Pope Francis and Chinese President Xi Jinping to Washington in quick succession, with climate change likely on the agenda for both meetings. And all along hell be battling Congress over government spending and his landmark nuclear deal with Iran., A major Pacific trade agreement is yet to be finalized, as are other legacy-building issues for Obama, including a potential plan to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay., But the president heads into these fights seemingly ready for battle. The August congressional recess that has in past yearsleft this White House on defense heading into the fall instead came and went with little controversy, and Obama aides see a chance to build momentum into the election year., The president himself challenged the Republican-led Congress this weekend to do its part for the economy and resolve a number of issues including a new spending package that must be passed by the end of September., Americans expect Congress to help keep our country strong and growing  not threaten to shut down our government, Obama saidin his weekly address. When Congress gets back, they should prevent a shutdown, pass a responsible budget, and prove that this is a country that looks forward  a country that invests in our future and keeps our economy growing for all Americans., Obama returned to Washington on Sunday after two weeks on Marthas Vineyard. Hours later, he hits the road again to build support for his climate agenda. On Monday in Las Vegas, hell tout his administrations newly unveiled Clean Power Plan, which aims to reduce carbon emissions at U.S. power plants by 32% by 2030 while ramping up production from renewable sources like wind and solar. A week later he will tour the rapidly melting glaciers of the Alaskan Arctic., Responding to the threat of climate change was among the most prominent pledges of Obamas second inaugural address, when he said that failure to do so would betray our children and future generations. The administration has invested considerable attention toward ensuring that world powers can announce a sweeping and binding agreement to reduce emissions at the United Nations climate summit in Paris that begins in late November. Obama is likely to attend as the summit nears conclusion in December., Climate will also be on the agenda when Pope Francis and Xi come to the White House in succession in late September. Francis forceful advocacy on the issue, including an encyclical published this summer in which he warned that our contemporary lifestyle, unsustainable as it is, can only precipitate catastrophes, has been cited by the administration and other advocates in pressing their case., To the extent Obama has succeeded in realizing his legacy-building goals in the lastyear, it has been, as in the case of climate, through full useof executive powers. The prospects for success are less certain when he must rely on congressional cooperation  particularly as he seeks to reverse steep spending cuts ahead of a Sept. 30 deadline to fund government operations. The White House also plans to push Congress on a new infrastructure package, and try to advance criminal justice reform and cybersecurity legislation., Though Obama has sought to preemptively pin the blame for another fiscal impasse on Republicans, Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), said the White House and congressional Democrats have clogged up the process demanding more spending. The most likely outcome, Stewart said, was a stopgap measure that maintains current spending levels on a short-term basis. Thats not a win, Stewart said., But a senior White House official argued that the administrations position on spending could be strengthened by the Republican divisions and the desire of GOP leaders to avoid another shutdown just as the presidential campaign is gearing up., Republicans in Congress have their work cut out for them, the official said on the condition of anonymity to preview Obamas fall agenda. At the same time, President Obama will not let up., The White House feels more confident after the recess about the fate of Obamas Iran nuclear agreement.

White House economists say that will lead to higher productivity in an era of stagnant wages, while nudging private companies and Congress to join in updating work conditions., NEWSLETTER:Get the days top headlines from Times Editor Davan Maharaj >>, This latest order will require companies that have federal contracts to let workers accrue up to seven days of paid sick leave each year., The action will provide coverage for as many as 300,000 workers whose jobs do not currently provide paid sick leave and many others with limited paid time-off benefits. It will begin in 2017., The U.S. is the only industrialized nation without a federal family-leave law that guarantees workers can receive pay while taking time to care for themselves and loved ones. Some states have paid-leave laws. Current federal law mandates that companies provide leave, but does not require that it be paid., Over the last year, Obama has used his executive authority to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 for workers in companies that contract with the federal government, expand overtime pay protections for all private-sector workers, and guarantee federal employees up to six weeks of paid leave with the arrival of a new child., See the most-read stories this hour >>, Labor Secretary Tom Perez, previewing the order for reporters on Sunday, saidits time to shelve notions about Americas working families that were set in the \"Leave it to Beaver\" era and modernize the workplace to keep the United States competitive with other global powers., \"Other countries have done it, and they see the benefit,\" said Perez, who has toured the country collecting stories of workers who suffered hardships, including a bus driver who brought her sick child with her on the bus rather than risk losing pay with time spent at home., The administration would not provide an estimate of how much the newbenefit will cost companies. But officials cited studies showing costs can be outweighed by the benefits of employee retention and worker satisfaction.

{"Content": "[[, President Obamas standing with the public likely will continue its recent upward trend following the latest positive economic news, but new data on the countrys polarized politics suggests hell soon bump up against a low ceiling., The labor market data released by the federal government on Friday showed the best three months of job growth since the mid-1990s, an increase in the percentage of Americans who are working and the first signs of wage growth., Thats the kind of good news that usually sends presidential approval ratings upward., But political polarization exerts a powerful pull in the other direction: Much like President George W. Bush before him, Obama faces near unanimous disapproval from opposing partisans that is deeply dug in and unlikely to change., Gallups latest analysis of a years worth of polling data illustrates the depth of the polarization., Across his sixth year as president, Obama averaged 79% approval from fellow Democrats but only 9% from Republicans. In the history of Gallups survey, that 70-point partisan gap is unrivaled, except for Bush, whose ratings in year six were identical to Obamas but with the party labels switched., Critics of both presidents decried their failure to unify the country, but the fact that two such different politicians could have identical degrees of polarization strongly suggests that the times, not the men, are to blame., In the past half century, the only years that showed more polarization than Obamas sixth year were his -- and Bushs -- fourth and fifth years., All of that suggests that Obamas overall approval rating probably will not rise much above 50% for any sustained period. The 64% approval that President Bill Clinton averaged in his sixth year, for example, is out of reach for Obama unless some completely unforeseen development causes Republicans to change their view of him., A sharply polarized electorate is not the worst thing that can happen to a president, however., The partisan gap for Bush narrowed in the last two years of his tenure. That wasnt because Democrats began to approve his performance more but because Republicans approved it less., Obama, by contrast, has been able to keep his party largely united behind him despite perennial tensions between the White House and congressional Democrats., With strong economic growth, executive actions on immigration and climate change, and policy proposals in his State of the Union speech that address Democratic priorities on a host of other issues, the unity on his side of the aisle likely will continue to grow., For more on politics and policy, follow @DavidLauter on Twitter.]", "Date": "20150206", "Title": "[Obama's approval ratings benefit from good economy but have low ceiling]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-polarized-polls-20150206-story.html", "Author": "[David Lauter]"}
{"Content": "[[, Presidents from Harry Truman to Bill Clinton have turned to foreign policy in their final months in office when their domestic agendas have been stymied. For Barack Obama, that overseas pivot may offer little relief., As he landed in Beijing on Monday morning as part of a weeklong trip to China, Myanmar and Australia, the stinging repudiation Obama suffered in last weeks midterm elections is likely to dishearten friends and embolden foreign adversaries, analysts say., Come January, he will face a Republican-dominated Congress whose leaders appear determined to take foreign policy in a more hawkish, more interventionist direction., \"The pummeling hes taking is creating the perception abroad that a president who was headed for lame-duck status is even less relevant,\" said Aaron David Miller, a U.S. diplomat from 1978 to 2003, and author of \"The End of Greatness,\" a book about the limits of presidential power., White House aides, in internal meetings, are mapping out plans to expand Obamas efforts abroad in his final two years in office. They say his authority as chief executive allows him to act without a specific congressional mandate in several sensitive areas, such as easing some sanctions on Iran., The White House has set challenging policy goals: sealing a nuclear deal with Iran, strengthening an unproven government in Afghanistan, mobilizing an international coalition against Islamic State militants, reaching regional trade deals in Asia and Europe, and turning Russia from adversary to ally., Foreign leaders, always keenly sensitive to the political strength of U.S. presidents, took note of the White House losses last week., Obama has evolved \"from the president of hope to the president of disappointment,\" Alexei Pushkov, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the State Duma, or lower house of the parliament, told the Tass news agency., Putin, angry that the United States and Europe have imposed sanctions on Russia over Ukraine, has shown no sign of backing down. In recent weeks, Moscow has sent a series of provocative military flights into European airspace., The Kremlin also said last week that it wont take part in the 2016 Nuclear Security Summit, which seeks to strengthen international controls to prevent terrorists from gaining access to nuclear materials. Obama initiated the summits in 2010., Because Russia is one of the largest potential sources of such material, Moscows boycott is a blow to the nonproliferation effort Obama hoped would be an important part of his legacy., The election setback also did not go unnoticed in Beijing, where Obama will meet this week with Chinese President Xi Jinping., The two leaders have sparred over cybersecurity, trade and Chinas growing military assertiveness in the South China Sea, and China has criticized Obamas efforts to boost Americas military presence in the western Pacific in a \"rebalance\" of U.S. forces., The GOP success means \"the lame-duck president will be further crippled,\" wrote the pro-government Global Times newspaper in Beijing. \"U.S. public opinion has downgraded Obama.\", The Republican sweep also could bolster Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has clashed with Obama over White House efforts to ease Israeli-Palestinian tension., Robert Danin, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle East, said that domestic American politics isnt the crucial factor in Netanyahus calculations, but the shift in Washingtons political landscape \"could embolden him.\", Republican control of the Senate also could complicate Obamas efforts to complete a nuclear deal with Iran this month, a foreign policy goal his aides consider as important to his White House legacy as his 2010 healthcare initiative., Obama has considerable leeway to work around Congress in implementing a nuclear deal, which would ease economic sanctions on Tehran in exchange for systems to ensure that Iran cannot build a nuclear bomb., But if Congress believes the deal is a poor one, it could mobilize to block it., Republican skeptics, including Sens. Mark Kirk of Illinois and Bob Corker of Tennessee, who is to take over the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, already are planning legislation that could threaten the negotiating effort by adding new sanctions on Iran or giving Congress more leverage over the deal., Republican hawks also will be ascendant. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz), who is expected to lead the Senate Armed Services Committee, is likely to push the White House to step up the military campaign against Islamic State, and to begin providing arms and ammunition to the government in Ukraine, among other issues., Obama may still have the upper hand in those disputes., But theres likely to be an ugly fight over Obamas request, which he announced at a news conference Wednesday, to seek congressional authorization for the bombing campaign against Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq., As a result, he may find it harder to persuade Turkey, Qatar and other members of the coalition battling the Sunni militants to provide money or military help., And he doesnt have some of the assets of previous presidents, such as strong personal relationships with world leaders, analysts say., \"The problem is with him [is] hes just not strong on that,\" said David Rothkopf, a former Clinton administration official who has written extensively on the National Security Council., Still, Obama will have it easier in some areas., One is the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership regional free trade agreement, another White House priority. The accord, which is still being negotiated, faces Democratic opposition in Congress. Republican leaders say they will give the deal a major push if negotiations succeed., And analysts note that Obamas fortunes could shift abruptly if he successfully manages a sudden terrorist danger, or manages to seal a good nuclear deal with Iran, thus neutralizing a major security threat., That \"would make a real difference for him,\" said Miller, the former U.S. diplomat, who is a vice president with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, a think tank in Washington., 6:24 p.m.: This post has been updated with President Obamas arrival in Beijing., It was originally published at 4:16 p.m., ]", "Date": "20141109", "Title": "[Election setbacks for Obama may embolden foreign adversaries]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-obama-foreign-20141110-story.html", "Author": "[Paul Richter]"}
{"Content": "[[, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus planned address to Congress next month is driving an uncomfortable and rarely seen wedge between congressional Democrats and Israel  and that may have been exactly what House Speaker John A. Boehner and other Republicans intended., For many Democrats, and especially the more than two dozen Jewish members of Congress, Boehners decision to invite Netanyahu to speak about Irans nuclear program  despite objections from the White House  is forcing them to choose between their president and their long-standing support for Israel., On Thursday, Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) became the third Jewish Democrat to say he would not attend the planned joint session speech, a surprising expression of protest in contrast to the usual outpouring of support and standing ovations U.S. lawmakers lavish on Israels leader., \"Theres a tension,\" said Rep. Alan Lowenthal (D-Long Beach), who has not decided whether to attend. \"The prime ministers coming puts us who are supportive of Israel in a difficult position, especially as Jews who do support Israel, because I think its totally inappropriate to come at this time.\", At least 20 other members of Congress have also vowed to skip the speech. Some see Netanyahus visit as an affront to the president, while others view it as the latest in a continuing effort by Republicans to upset the ties between Democrats and Jewish American voters and donors., Boehner insisted the invitation was intended only to give a key ally a forum for discussing the Iran nuclear talks, in which Israel has a significant stake., But privately, Republican aides havent hidden their delight at how the issue is vexing Democrats, without conceding that was the intent., Democrats suspect politics were part of the reason Boehner broke the usual protocol by not coordinating the invitation of a foreign leader with the White House., \"I dont know whats in the speakers mind,\" said Democratic Rep. Lois Frankel, who represents a district in south Florida with a sizable Jewish population and plans to attend the speech. \"He could be thinking about Iran, he could be thinking about politics. I am just very disturbed  and I would say upset  that Israel is to be used as a political football.\", Though Israel has long coveted the bipartisan support it enjoys in Congress, Netanyahus Likud Party and U.S. Republicans have moved closer together in recent years, joined by shared conservative ideologies and hawkish foreign policies. Evangelicals, who are often more pro-Israel than many Jewish Americans, have also pushed the GOP toward greater support of the Netanyahu government., So have wealthy donors like casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who contributed more than $100 million to Republicans in the 2012 campaign and is expected to be a major player in the 2016 presidential race. Adelson, who is Jewish and is married to an Israeli, is also one of Netanyahus biggest political patrons; he owns a free, pro-government daily newspaper in Israel that has become one of the countrys most-read., But in the U.S., 70% of American Jews identify with the Democratic Party, while just 22% with the GOP, according to a 2013 study by Pew Research Center. President Obama won 69% of the Jewish American vote in 2012, according to exit polling reported by NBC News, though support dropped from 78% in his 2008 election., \"Youre seeing an emerging split between a part of the community that is politically in line with the prime minister and in line with the Republican Party, and a part of the community that is more supportive of a progressive political agenda here and the Labor Party there,\" said Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of J Street, a liberal pro-Israel group. Boehners invitation \"has successfully exposed that that difference can no longer be papered over.\", Obama publicly declined this week to offer advice to fellow Democrats when asked whether they should attend Netanyahus address, though he has said he wouldnt meet with the prime minister when he comes next month, citing the proximity to Israels March 17 election., Vice President Joe Biden, who would usually attend the speech as the president of the Senate, is proceeding with plans to travel abroad then., Amid the initial controversy over the invitation, top Israeli officials worked the halls of the U.S. Capitol last week to gauge the level of concern, particularly among Democrats., The speaker of Israels Knesset met separately with Boehner and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), and the Israeli ambassador to the United States met with a small group of pro-Israel Democrats who expressed concern at how the planned visit had devolved into a partisan fight., But this week Netanyahu sought to quell speculation that he might change plans, saying on Twitter that he was \"determined\" to address Congress., Major Jewish groups have largely stayed out of the fray, including the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which will also host Netanyahu during his visit. But the Republican Jewish Coalition launched a petition urging support for the address. J Street, meanwhile, is calling on Boehner to reschedule the speech after Israeli elections., For now, most Jewish Democrats plan to attend. Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) said it was \"unseemly\" to invite a foreign head of state to speak against White House policy, but that he would be a \"gracious host.\", \"One of the things that overshadows this whole controversy is the fact that there have been efforts over the last few years to politicize support for Israel,\" he said. \"The strength of the U.S.-Israel relationship has always been at its core a very bipartisan one. I think anything that threatens to jeopardize that is not good for the U.S. and is not good for Israel.\", Rep. Eliot L. Engel of New York, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, dismissed the controversy as \"a tempest in a teapot.\", \"It doesnt matter that the president and the prime minister dont like each other,\" he said. \"Im mostly concerned about the U.S.-Israel relationship and that it remains strong and remains bipartisan.  The minute Israel becomes a partisan issue, then the U.S.-Israel relationship suffers.\", The most vocal Democratic critics of the invitation have been non-Jews. Sen. Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the most senior Democratic senator, accused Republicans of orchestrating a \"tawdry and high-handed stunt that has embarrassed not only Israel but the Congress itself.\", The Jewish Americans who are skipping the speech have been careful in discussing the issue, wary of escalating the controversy., \"There are other venues where Id be open to hearing from Mr. Netanyahu, and there are other time periods where I think itd be appropriate,\" said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii). \"But I think this was done in a way that was unhelpful to the America-Israel relationship, and I dont want to participate in it for that reason.\", Noting that some outside political and pro-Israel groups are already threatening electoral retribution for lawmakers who dont attend, Yarmuth posted a 600-word statement explaining his view that Netanyahu \"has plenty of other places to express his opinions.\", \"It is both sad and ridiculous that attending this speech will be used as a litmus test for support of Israel,\" Yarmuth said. \"I will not contribute to the impression that this body does not support the president of the United States in foreign affairs.\", michael.memoli@latimes.com, Twitter: @mikememoli]", "Date": "20150212", "Title": "[Netanyahu's U.S. speech drives a wedge between Democrats, Israel ]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-democrats-netanyahu-20150213-story.html", "Author": "[Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, Promotions and policy decisions at the Justice Department have been put off. Announcements have slowed to a trickle. Congress is waiting for input on the agencys budget priorities., Amid the stalled Senate confirmation of attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch, the nations biggest law enforcement agency finds itself in partial limbo., Department officials havent even been able to decide whether they should participate in a major international meeting on cybersecurity this spring., \"There is a constant complication about committing to things,\" said Robert Raben, a former assistant attorney general who is advising Lynch on the nomination and remains in touch with department officials. \"For April and May, there are an enormous amount of things that are on hold. Its impossible for the leadership to know what to commit to, because they do not know if Ms. Lynch is going to have a different view.\", The Senate returns to session this week and the votes to approve Lynch to replace outgoing Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. appear in place. But there is no clear indication from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) as to when he will schedule a vote., Although Holder remains on the job, he has scheduled few public appearances. Colleagues say he has already had to postpone one vacation trip and is eager to get back to private practice without the constraints of government., Holder \"remains very engaged in high-level discussions about cases and policy matters,\" said Emily Pierce, acting director of public affairs., But administration officials acknowledged privately that non-urgent decisions are being held in abeyance. \"There are major policy decisions that are on hold,\" said one department official who was not authorized to speak publicly about internal matters., Lynchs record and experience are not the reasons shes been waiting five months since being nominated, the longest delay in recent memory and more than those of the previous seven attorney general nominees combined., Instead, her ascent has been embroiled in partisan politics., Democrats share part of the blame. First, they urged the White House to refrain from naming a successor to Holder  who announced in September hed step down  until after the congressional election in November because they feared a controversial choice might hurt their chances., Then after the election, the Democratic-controlled lame-duck Senate decided against moving forward on the confirmation when they had the chance, punting the nomination to the new GOP-led Senate., During her Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in January, Lynch generally made a favorable impression, eventually winning the support of three committee Republicans. She has backing from major law enforcement groups., But many Republicans voiced frustration with her refusal to disavow President Obamas executive actions on immigration, which would defer deportation for millions of immigrants in the U.S. illegally. Though the issue would mostly not fall under Lynchs direct purview, Republican critics see the presidents moves as exceeding his legal authority., Lynch appears to have secured the necessary 51 votes for confirmation, helped this month by the announcement of Sen. Mark Steven Kirk (R-Ill.) that he would vote for her., But now the vote has been held up by an unrelated battle over a human trafficking bill. Democrats, though supportive of the bills aims, are filibustering the legislation because it contains a provision that they say would expand existing restrictions on abortion. McConnell said he would not schedule a vote on Lynch until after the Senate approved the bill., \"The only thing holding up the Lynch vote is the Democrats filibuster of a human trafficking bill that would help prevent kids from being sold into sex slavery,\" McConnell spokesman Michael Brumas said. \"The sooner they allow the Senate to pass that bipartisan bill, the sooner the Senate can move to the Lynch nomination.\", Democrats have responded by accusing Republicans of blocking the first African American woman nominated to become the nations top law enforcement officer. Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) last month accused Republicans of asking Lynch \"to sit in the back of the bus when it comes to the Senate calendar.\", Confidentially, some administration officials acknowledge that it was a mistake for Holder to promise to stay on until his successor was confirmed. A vacancy at the top of what is now a key national security branch probably would have compelled Republicans to move faster and avoided the partial administrative paralysis now affecting the department., James M. Cole, a former deputy attorney general who left in January, said the lack of permanent leadership hindered the departments effectiveness., \"There are law enforcement matters, national security matters, civil rights issues, police department [investigations]  issues that you start to disrupt when you have somebody waiting in the wings who you know is going to get in, but they are not there yet,\" Cole said. \"In any major case, including organized crime or corruption or national security, you want somebody who is going to make the ultimate decisions who has been able to follow the case through from the beginning.\", tim.phelps@latimes.com, Twitter: timphelpsLAT, Times staff writer Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.]", "Date": "20150413", "Title": "[Justice Department in partial limbo as Loretta Lynch awaits confirmation]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-lynch-confirmation-20150413-story.html", "Author": "[Timothy M.

They are expected to show another healthy increase in new jobs., There were mixed signals on the labor market Thursday ahead of the report., Initial claims for jobless benefits jumped last week to a nine-month high of 320,000, the Labor Department said. The second-straight weekly increase could have been caused by severe winter weather., At the same time, planned layoffs by U.S. businesses fell 5% in February from the previous month, according to career counseling firm Challenger Gray & Christmas Inc., Several months of strong job growth have had a notable effect on public views of the economy. Nearly 70% of Americans now say they believe the job situation has at least partially recovered, the Pew report found., Thats a big change since Pew last asked that question, in September 2013, when fewer than half of Americans thought the job market had begun recovering., In the current survey, about 7 in 10 Americans said they viewed current economic conditions as fair or good, and almost 8 in 10 said they believed next year will be the same or better, the poll found. The poll also found majorities holding positive views about improvement in real estate and the stock market, as well as jobs., Despite those improvements, many Americans still have significant worries about their economic situation and the nations., About 3 in 10 Americans said their personal finances had yet to recover from the recession. Another 3 in 10 said they took a significant hit in the recession and had recovered, while about 4 in 10 said the recession had not had a major effect on them., The more positive assessments, not surprisingly, came from those higher up the income ladder. Among Americans with household incomes of $100,000 or more, only 14% said they had not yet recovered from the recession, while half said the recession had not significantly affected their personal financial situation., By about 2 to 1, Americans said the economy remained just as vulnerable to a major crisis as it had been before the financial meltdown in 2008., Obama administration officials have repeatedly tried to make the case that reforms adopted in 2009 and 2010, including the Dodd-Frank law that expanded oversight of the financial system, have made the economy more stable., The results of the latest round of so-called stress tests of major banks, released Thursday by the Federal Reserve, backed up those assertions. The nations 31 largest banks had enough capital to withstand a severe economic shock similar to the 2008 financial crisis., It was the first time since the regulators began the tests in 2009 that all major banks would still have capital levels above the Feds minimum under such a scenario., But the Pew survey and others show widespread public skepticism that the economy is better able to withstand a crisis., By a similar majority of almost 2 to 1, Americans said the economic system unfairly favors powerful interests., Large majorities said government policies since the recession have helped big banks and financial institutions (71%), large corporations (67%) and wealthy people (66%). But many fewer said they see those policies as having helped the poor (32%), small businesses (28%) or the middle class (26%), the latter of which is the group that the vast majority of Americans, nearly 9 in 10, see themselves in., The belief that the economy tilts toward the powerful is strongest in the center of the American income distribution. Among those with family incomes of $30,000 to $100,000, nearly 70% took that view, the poll found., Perhaps not surprisingly, those with incomes above $100,000 were somewhat less likely to see the economy as unfair, with 60% saying so., But that was also true at the bottom of the income ladder, among those with family incomes of $30,000 and below. Among that group, which includes a significant number of young people, minorities and immigrants, 57% said they saw the economy as unfair, while 37% said it was generally fair to most Americans., The Pew poll, conducted by landline and cellphone from Feb. 18 to 22, surveyed 1,504 Americans ages 18 and older.

{"Content": "[[, Public support for a more active U.S. foreign policy has grown sharply since last year as Americans see the world becoming more dangerous., Those findings, from a newly released Pew Research Center survey, provide an important backdrop for President Obamas decision-making regarding U.S. military action against Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria and possible steps to counter Russias invasion of Ukraine., The increased support for an active U.S. policy overseas could have a big effect on the race to succeed Obama in 2016, especially among Republicans., Nearly one-third of Americans now say that the U.S. does too little to address global problems. Thats almost as many as say the U.S. is too deeply involved overseas., A Pew poll in November found that those who wanted the United States to do less outnumbered those who wanted a more active policy by 51%-17%., Two-thirds of Americans say the world has grown more dangerous in the last several years, the poll found., Opinion has shifted toward activism across the political spectrum, but the change is most dramatic among conservative Republicans., Among Republicans who say they identify with the tea party, 54% now say the U.S. does too little to help solve world problems, and only 33% say the U.S. does too much., Thats almost a mirror image of opinions among that group last year, when 54% said the U.S. was doing too much and 22% said too little., That shift among conservative Republicans, if it persists, could pose a big challenge to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), whose advocacy of less overseas involvement by the U.S. forms a central part of his potential presidential campaign., Pauls foreign policy approach, which critics in the party have labeled isolationist, has appealed to many conservatives, but could now be out of sync with a major shift in public attitudes, the poll indicates., For Obama, growing support for a more active foreign policy offer a freer hand to respond militarily to the Islamic State militants who have captured a large swath of territory in northern and western Iraq and in neighboring Syria, if he chooses to do so., At the same time, however, the poll shows that a majority of the public, 54%, believes his foreign policy is not tough enough. Thats roughly the same as last years percentage, but is notably higher than during his re-election campaign in 2012, when 41% took that view., The 54% who said Obama is not tough enough on foreign affairs include a significant share of groups who otherwise support him., Four-in-ten blacks, for example, said Obamas approach was not tough enough. So did 45% of those younger than 30 and about one-third of Democrats., Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has recently criticized Obamas approach to some conflicts, suggesting that she would take a tougher line if she were president., The poll indicates that a significant percentage of Democrats are open to that view, although liberal Democrats, who dominate the partys nominating process, were the least likely to share it., Among self-identified liberal Democrats, only one-quarter said Obama was not tough enough, while 66% said his approach was about right. Among Republicans, by contrast, 77% said he was not tough enough and 16% said his approach was about right., Some liberal activists have accused Obama of following too militaristic a foreign policy, with too many lethal drone airstrikes on militant groups, for example, but that view is not widely shared. Only 3% in the survey said Obamas approach was too tough, including 6% of liberal Democrats., Asked what world problems pose a major threat to the U.S., the public continued to mention Islamic extremists most frequently, with both Al Qaeda and Islamic State ranking at the top of the list. Almost two-thirds of Americans said they believe militant Islam will grow in influence in the Mideast over the long term., About half of those surveyed listed tension between Russia and its neighbors as a major threat to the U.S., after Russias growing intervention in neighboring Ukraine. By contrast, concern about Chinas rise as a world power appears to have lessened since last year., More than two-thirds of Democrats list global climate change as a major threat, while only one-quarter of Republicans do so. Most Republicans say they see climate change as not a threat at all (40%) or as a minor threat (32%)., About half of those surveyed said they believe the U.S. has a less powerful and important role as a world leader than it did 10 years ago, while about one-third said the U.S. role is about the same as it has been. And 15% said U.S. importance and power has grown in the last decade., The survey by the Pew Research Center for USA Today was conducted Aug. 20-24 among 1,501 adults.

{"Content": "[[, Quick quiz: Which potential 2016 presidential candidate had this to say about federal anti-poverty programs last week?, \"What do we want? A healthy economy  and a big part of that is having a strong safety net, both for those who cant help themselves and for those who just need a helping hand.  I want to talk about how we can repair the safety net and help families get ahead.\", If you guessed Hillary Clinton or another Democrat, guess again. The correct answer is Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), the conservative champion who was Mitt Romneys running mate in 2012., Yes, this is the same Paul Ryan who once warned that the federal safety net was becoming \"a hammock that lulls able-bodied people to lives of dependency and complacency,\" blamed poverty on \"a tailspin of culture in our inner cities,\" and proposed cutting Food Stamps by almost 20% over 10 years., But last week, Ryan unveiled a 73-page domestic policy plan that broke with Republican orthodoxy on several counts  mainly by affirming that the federal government has an obligation to fund programs to help poor people and that sometimes that will mean spending more money, not less., Ryan proposed bundling federal spending on poverty programs into what were once called \"block grants\" to states, to allow them to experiment with new approaches to helping the poor  but at current spending levels, without the cuts he demanded only a few months ago., And he endorsed a proposal from President Obama (a daring move for anyone in the GOP) to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit for people without children. That would increase federal spending on the tax rebate for low-income earners, a program some tea party conservatives loathe., It isnt that Ryan has abandoned his previous views entirely, but hes changed his focus from merely trying to shrink the federal government to making existing federal programs work better, too., Even some Democrats were impressed. \"I was blown away,\" said Isabel V. Sawhill, a former Clinton administration official who studies anti-poverty programs at the Brookings Institution. \"Its a big step for him to move away from budget cutting and toward something more positive. Hes pulling the Republican Party back toward the middle.... I like a lot of what I saw.\", And Ryans not alone. His proposals are part of a broader search among Republicans for post-tea party policies that might appeal to more voters than the austere small-government platform that helped them lose the presidential election of 2012., \"The Romney-Ryan ticket lost because it was perceived as not caring about people,\" argued Henry Olsen of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, one of a loose group of conservative scholars in Washington who have been dubbed \"Reform Republicans.\", \"We need to find a way to speak the language of compassion,\" he said. \"Theres a streak in the Republican Party that says the way to help people is primarily by empowering the private sector, but Ryans saying thats not enough. Thats a conceptual breakthrough for the modern Republican Party.\", Not surprisingly, Democrats are reacting with well-honed skepticism., \"Watch what they do, not what they say,\" said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), the top-ranking Democrat on Ryans House Budget Committee. He dismissed Ryans proposal to send anti-poverty money to the states as \"nothing more than a block grant\"  a device Republicans have used to try to cut spending in the past  \"gussied up with some bells and whistles.\", But Ryan insisted that, while he still wants to cut overall spending, thats not the purpose of his proposal. \"This is not a budget-cutting exercise,\" he said in his paper., Other Democrats objected to a Ryan proposal that poor people sign contracts with \"opportunity goals\"  finding a job, getting an education  that they must meet or lose their public aid. That may not work in an economy thats still struggling to provide jobs for the unemployed, they argued., But ultimately, Ryans ideas  and those of other Republican reformers  may face their toughest audience inside the GOP. \"There are Republicans who are afraid of cutting a deal like this,\" noted Ron Haskins, another scholar at the Brookings Institution (and a former aide to President George W. Bush). \"Theyll get attacked in primaries for supporting government spending on the poor.\", Whether or not Ryans proposals get traction, a shift in the partys focus (or at least in its rhetoric) is starting to feel inevitable. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), for example, said last week that hes in favor of more federal help for single mothers and working class families, including easier loan repayment rates for recent college graduates. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) told the Urban League last week that he wants changes in the criminal justice system, including sentencing reform to reduce racial inequities., GOP politicians are no longer simply competing over whos more zealous about cutting spending and repealing Obamacare; theyre actually talking about ideas for innovation., So, whether he runs for president or not, Paul Ryan just made the 2016 GOP presidential race more interesting  and more substantive., doyle.mcmanus@latimes.com, Twitter: @DoyleMcManus]", "Date": "20140726", "Title": "[ Anti-poverty talk from conservative Paul Ryan?]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-mcmanus-column-republican-reform-20140727-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, Rand Paul, the heretofore libertarian senator from Kentucky, gave a foreign policy speech to Republican grandees in New York last week with a clear message: Im not an isolationist like my dad., The senators peppery father, the thoroughly libertarian former Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, hardly ever saw a U.S. military intervention he liked. He said George W. Bushs war in Iraq was nuts, suggested that the United States could live with a nuclear Iran and thought stationing U.S. troops overseas was just an expensive way to invite trouble., On Thursday evening in a Manhattan ballroom, Sen. Paul, a probable GOP candidate for president in 2016, declared himself an advocate of conservative realism and named as his models Ronald Reagan, Dwight D. Eisenhower and even (on free trade, not military adventures) George W. Bush., The war on terror is not over, and America cannot disengage from the world, Paul said. Speaking in a way likely to make Dad shudder, he called military force indispensable  when vital American interests are attacked and threatened, and said he supports airstrikes against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (but not arming Syrian rebels, whom he considers unreliable)., But the most intriguing aspect of the speech wasnt Pauls attempt to distance himself from his father; it was his attempt to distance himself from himself., The old Rand, who ran for the Senate expressing strong libertarian views in 2010, is quite different from the new Rand, whos gearing up for a possible presidential campaign., Take the war on terror. A year ago, Paul gained national attention for his filibuster over drone strikes against U.S. members of Al Qaeda. And only a few months ago, Paul said he didnt see any need to act against Islamic State. Why should we choose a side? he asked in a June 19 column in the Wall Street Journal., But after the group beheaded two American journalists in Syria, the new Rand Paul abruptly turned 180 degrees. If I had been in President Obamas shoes, I would have acted more decisively and strongly against ISIS, he said., Then theres U.S. aid to Israel. When he arrived in the Senate in 2011, the old Rand Paul proposed eliminating all foreign aid, including the roughly $3 billion a year that goes to the Jewish state. Should we be giving free money or welfare to a wealthy nation? I dont think so, he told ABC News., But when that position provoked fury from pro-Israel Republicans, the new Rand Paul backed down, voted in favor of renewed military aid and insisted that his point had been misconstrued., In domestic affairs, the old Rand Paul, like his father, disliked federal civil rights laws barring racial discrimination by privately owned businesses such as rental apartments, hotels and restaurants., I abhor racism. I think its a bad business decision to ever exclude anybody from your restaurant. But at the same time, I do believe in private ownership, he said in a 2010 interview., When that kicked up a furor, the new Rand Paul issued a hasty clarification. I would have voted yes, he said, if he had been in Congress when the 1964 Civil Rights bill came up., More recently, the new Rand Paul has not only called for reforming federal drug sentencing laws, which he says discriminate against African Americans, he says he would plow some of the money now spent on prisons into federal job training programs., I was blown away because I was thinking, this doesnt sound like libertarianism to me, the Rev. Kevin Cosby, a Louisville, Ky., civil rights leader who has advised Paul, told the New Yorker. This sounds like big government., And on the social issues dear to a big chunk of the Republican electorate, Paul has been equally difficult to pin down. Like his father, he has vigorously opposed abortion rights, even in cases of rape or incest. Hes introduced the Life at Conception Act, which would guarantee federal civil rights to embryos beginning at the moment of fertilization., But the new Rand Paul roiled the waters by saying he didnt have a problem with Plan B, the day-after pill that may stop a fertilized egg from implanting in the womb., All those newfound nuances may make Paul more palatable to a broader cross-section of primary voters if he decides to seek the Republican nomination in 2016., But hes also created a problem for himself. Some of his original admirers arent sure they like him much anymore. Matt Welch, editor of the libertarian magazine Reason, wrote that Paul was guilty of slipperiness at best, flip-floppery at worst., Paul gets tetchy when reporters ask him about all those seeming changes in position, insisting that hes being willfully misunderstood. A politician can get away with that when its only reporters who are asking., But if he runs, the new Rand Paul will face real live opponents like Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz. They wont let him sidle away from the exotic positions once championed by the old Rand Paul; theyll insist that the new Rand Paul recant, rebut or reaffirm them. And that could mean a splendid debate, pitting the two Rand Pauls against each other  on live television, in split-screen., doyle.mcmanus@latimes.com, Twitter: @doylemcmanus]", "Date": "20141024", "Title": "[The new Rand Paul vs. the old Rand Paul]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-mcmanus-column-rand-paul-20141026-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}

{"Content": "[[, Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Menlo Park) lost her bid to serve as the top Democrat on a key House committee next year in what was also a rare setback for Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) in an internal party contest., New Jersey Democrat Frank Pallone defeated Eshoo, 100-90, in a vote of the full Democratic caucus Wednesday morning on who will serve as ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, after a bitter race that brought to the fore some dissatisfaction over party leadership. Pelosi had hoped to secure the position for her fellow Californian and close ally after Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Beverly Hills) retires this year., But Pallone had in his corner Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), the minority whip, and members of influential constituencies such as the Congressional Black Caucus., On Tuesday, Pelosi was reelected to the top leadership post in the party without any public dissent. But later in the meeting a tense debate erupted over Pelosis insistence that Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), a junior member who is due to give birth to her first child any day, not be allowed to cast a vote in the race by proxy. Some saw it as an effort by Pelosi to influence the vote., Eshoo had won an initial vote for the position Tuesday night in the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, a party body with more loyalty to Pelosi. However, she failed to secure enough votes to avoid triggering a vote of the full party membership., A primary question in the race is what role a members length of service should play in deciding committee leadership positions. Pallone was first elected in 1988, four years before Eshoo. Pelosi nonetheless publicly endorsed Eshoo, saying that seniority was an important factor but should not be determinative, citing precedent where other more senior members were passed over., But seniority is an important concern, particularly for members of the Congressional Black Caucus, whose members tend to represent safer districts that allow them to build up an advantage over other members., In an interview with The Times on Monday, Pelosi said Eshoos elevation to the top Democratic spot on the powerful committee would be important for the party, allowing her to tap into lucrative fundraising interests in Silicon Valley and elsewhere that the committee has jurisdiction over, and enabling Pelosi to spend more on party building and messaging -- a priority if Democrats hope to reclaim the House in the near future., However, Pelosi denied at the time that she had invested significant personal capital in the effort beyond sending several letters to the caucus as a whole., \"I dont think Ive spoken to 20 people about Annas race,\" she said. \"Time is money for me. I gotta be doing something else in an election year than making calls about an internal [fight].\", In a statement after Wednesdays vote, Pelosi congratulated Pallone on his \"hard-fought campaign.\", Determining committee seats is one of the most difficult internal fights a party has after each election, pitting colleagues against one another and testing internal loyalties. Other Democratic leadership posts remain to be determined, but Pelosi also announced Wednesday that Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) will retain her post as ranking member of the Financial Services Committee., Republican Rep.

{"Content": "[[, Rep. Kevin McCarthy celebrated his first election to Congress at an In-N-Out Burger, sipping sodas from paper cups at Formica tables with his wife and children. The understated evening fit perfectly into the Bakersfield Republicans image as the son of a firefighter who started his first business, a deli, with proceeds from a winning lottery ticket., Eight years later, as the new House majority leader, McCarthy commands a multimillion-dollar political operation featuring lavish meals, opulent getaways with lobbyists, and privately chartered aircraft., In the two years leading up to last falls election, McCarthy, through his reelection campaign and leadership PAC, spent $140,000 on steakhouses alone. He paid $426,000 to companies that charter private jets, covering 46 trips. And he raised at least $10.5 million for his own and party political committees., That spending and fundraising have fueled one of the fastest rises to power in congressional history., At the time of his election last summer to the No. 2 post in the House, McCarthy had spent fewer than four full terms in Congress. He was the most junior person to reach a top leadership post since the early 19th century., He may lack some of the qualities of previous top party leaders in the House - the grand political vision of Newt Gingrich, the deal-making savvy of Tip ONeill, the strong arm of Tom DeLay. But McCarthy excels at something else that has become key to leadership in Congress: recruiting candidates and raising money for them., McCarthy seldom takes sides in the partys intramural battles over ideology. He has a solidly conservative voting record, but is associated with relatively few legislative causes. The issue on which he has the highest profile is a persistent effort to roll back environmental laws that he says have hurt agriculture in California, particularly rules that set aside water for wildlife conservation., His rapid ascent hasnt been the result of his political positions. Rather, it highlights the important role that fundraising plays in Washington., In a statement in response to written questions, a spokesman said McCarthys focus had been on providing leadership for \"conservative principles and vision,\" a goal that \"does include fundraising for the party and for candidates.\", McCarthys talent for navigating todays all-but-unlimited system of campaign finance was on display last month when he hosted a few dozen lobbyists and other Washington insiders at Bostons Liberty Hotel, a renovated 19th century jail with a granite facade, cheeky jail-themed cocktail bars, views of the Charles River and a lobby with a 90-foot ceiling that becomes a multi-level nightclub. Guests received complimentary flutes of cava upon arrival., Getaways with lobbyists were at the center of a scandal a decade ago that sent lobbyist Jack Abramoff to prison and brought down House Majority Leader DeLay. New ethics rules passed afterward were supposed to put a stop to them., But lawmakers in both parties have since found a way to sidestep the rules. Lobbyists no longer bankroll trips directly. Instead, they write checks to a lawmakers campaign accounts. Those accounts then pay for the lawmakers travel., One thing hasnt changed: Lobbyists are not required to disclose expenses of the many weekends they spend hobnobbing with lawmakers., At these intimate gatherings, lobbyists get the kind of casual access that builds valuable relationships with top lawmakers and their staffs. Lawmakers and lobbyists are often encouraged to bring families along. McCarthys getaway this fall, at the $499-a-night Planters Inn in Charleston, S.C., will be held the weekend before Thanksgiving, according to an invitation., The point of such gatherings is not to discuss specific legislation, but to build relationships between lawmakers and donors who often direct funds from trade associations and political action committees to a leaders favored candidates., \"You dont sit around and talk about HR 301 and how to get it passed,\" said Lindsay Mark Lewis, who raised more than $200 million for Democrats before writing a book about the sway that wealthy donors have over Washington. \"It is a bonding experience over a policy experience.\", McCarthys campaign declined to provide a guest list for the Boston function., Such excursions, often referred to as destination fundraisers, have become mainstays for members of Congress moving up the leadership ladder, in both parties., Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles), the fourth-ranking member of the Democratic leadership, takes donors even farther from Washington, to the Dorado Beach Resort in Puerto Rico, \"home to four legendary championship golf courses, plantation-style resort residences, world-class cuisine and beach activities for the whole family,\" according to the resorts website., \"I come from a district where no one goes to raise money,\" said Becerra, whose district covers much of the Eastside of Los Angeles. \"In politics, unfortunately I think, you have to learn how to raise money. Otherwise you dont survive.\", Becerra declined to provide an itinerary or a list of those who attended last years trip to Puerto Rico. He said fundraising and other aspects of policy were a means \"to do the best policy possible.\", In McCarthys case, the work of building a financial stockpile started even before his first election to the House in 2006., The seat was being vacated by his mentor, former Rep. Bill Thomas, who accompanied McCarthy through the Washington fundraising circuit, attending events alongside Gingrich and John A. Boehner of Ohio, then the majority leader, now speaker of the House. In Washington and California, Thomas lobbied big donors and influential politicians to help his protege., What donors found most impressive about McCarthy, according to people who watched the meetings, was the statistical precision with which he could assess Republican chances in even the most far-flung congressional races. He wowed them with algorithms for probing Democratic weaknesses and persuasive riffs on the promise of potential tea party candidates most had not heard of before McCarthy mentioned their names., Before he was sworn in, McCarthy had distributed to other Republicans tens of thousands of the dollars he had raised. He also gave $50,000 from his campaign funds to the National Republican Congressional Committee, a generous amount for someone who had not yet been elected. He traveled widely, lending support to Republicans in difficult races., \"I wanted to start building relationships and help bring more allies to Congress for the hard work I knew lay ahead,\" he said in \"Young Guns,\" the 2010 book he co-wrote with Republican House colleagues Eric Cantor of Virginia and Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, which shares a title with the fundraising network the three men created., McCarthy quickly leapfrogged other junior members of the House, establishing himself as a major part of the GOPs effort to recruit and fund candidates to recapture control of the chamber, which they had lost in 2006., Republican campaign workers still talk about that four-year effort, which came to fruition in the 2010 election. They talk of McCarthy driving cheap rental cars down lonely country roads, a single staffer riding shotgun, on their way to bean suppers, fish fries and Chamber of Commerce events., As his prominence has grown, those country roads have been replaced by runways., Charter travel was rare in McCarthys first congressional election in 2006. He made two payments for $3,600 that year to private air-travel companies, according to campaign records, about enough to ride for two or three hours in a small plane., In the last two years, the period during which McCarthy went from No. 3 in the House to No. 2, the amount he spent on charter air travel soared more than a hundredfold from that first campaign., McCarthy used Golden State Air Charter for most of his private jet travel. The company, based in Bakersfield, offers a range of options  from light jets that travel two to three hours  to long-haul aircraft, \"the ultimate luxury in private jet travel,\" the company says  complete with beds, plush couches, in-flight entertainment, food and flight attendant service., Campaign records do not specify where the planes flew or the identities of the passengers. The campaign declined to provide that information, but said three-quarters of the flights were within California and noted that commercial flights from Bakersfield are limited., McCarthy spoke proudly of his busy travel schedule. \"The month before the election last November he told a group of us that he was in 100 districts in 31 or 32 days,\" said auto dealer Fritz Hitchcock, a GOP donor and former chairman of the California Chamber of Commerce. \"He is a horse. He is a hardworking guy.\", Election day has passed, but the pace of fundraising has barely slowed. McCarthy bounces from headlining low-dollar events like a Corpus Christi barbecue for Texas Rep. Blake Farenthold  donors were asked to help him retain his congressional seat by buying $27 tickets  to dinner in the Southern California home of billionaire Tony Pritzker, an heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune., He has an uncanny ability to keep up that pace without ever seeming rushed. \"He was available for everybody to talk one on one,\" said former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, who was at the Pritzker event. \"He had pictures taken with everyone.\", Riordan is excited to bankroll McCarthy because he sees him as a flexible moderate. \"He is very open-minded,\" Riordan said. When the archbishop of Los Angeles asked Riordan whether McCarthy might be open to chatting about immigration issues, Riordan said, \"I called Kevin up and within a minute he said yes.\", Yet many in the tea party also consider McCarthy to be on their side. Many tea party-influenced members, who typically view the GOP as too prone to compromise and too attentive to the interests of big business rather than conservative, populist concerns, owe their seats in Congress to him. He recruited them. He raised money for them., He doesnt scold when they rebel against positions taken by the GOP leadership, they say.

{"Content": "[[, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield faced an immediate test as his ascension to House majority leader became official Thursday, as he and other Republican leaders struggled to build support for their bill to provide emergency funds for the immigration crisis on the southern border., The ominous start to McCarthys tenure as the No. 2 House Republican was not lost on many in the Capitol. , The plan had been for Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, the Republican Conference chairwoman, to notify the House clerk of the leadership change after the final scheduled vote Thursday, when most lawmakers would have been present in the House chamber., Instead, the chamber was nearly empty when the announcement was made formalizing the transition from outgoing leader Eric Cantor of Virginia, just moments before the House adjourned for the night., Cantor, whose defeat in a primary election last month stunned Washington and was blamed in part on his views on immigration reform, bid an emotional farewell to his colleagues earlier Thursday afternoon on the House floor. , During the speech, he noted how members \"dont always see eye to eye, even within our own parties.\", Hours later, leaders scrambled to rearrange the schedule when it became clear that their border bill lacked the votes needed to ensure its passage. Members were first told that a vote on highway funding would be the last for the month, but soon after that a vote on the border package could still come. , Republicans later held an emergency conference meeting to try and chart a path forward, deciding in the end to reconvene Friday. , McCarthy had all but settled into his new role before Thursday. Though he will not be moving from his first-floor Capitol suite to the one Cantor had used just off the House chamber, McCarthy has hired new staff to build up his policy team, including some whod worked for his predecessor. , During the day, he even updated his Twitter handle from @GOPWhip to @GOPLeader., Thursdays developments aside, few blamed the new leadership team of McCarthy and Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, McCarthys successor as whip, for the breakdown., \"We run into the same road blocks every time,\" said Rep. Devin Nunes of California, blaming a small group that often votes against the leadership. \"Theres just a lot of people who are more concerned about the [outside] groups or their Senate colleagues than they are about actually leading and getting something done.\", Added Rep. John Fleming of Louisiana: I dont think this is any discredit to them, this was their first task  it just happens to be they were handed a Mt. Everest., In Thursdays closed-door meeting, many expressed their desire to stay in session until a resolution on the border issue could be found. One member told his colleagues he would be willing to stay in Washington through next week even if it meant missing his sons wedding., \"The way that theyre leading right now is the way leaders should lead,\" said Rep.

She said in a video that it is time for me to return home, back to the community and family that I love so much., Its been a hard decision to make, for I have loved this job, she added., Capps, 77, initially signed a pledge to serve no more than three terms in Congress  a limitation that expired a decade ago., President Obama lauded Capps for a lasting legacy of service. , She has led efforts to increase access to healthcare, improve mental health services, detect and prevent domestic violence, protect our environment, and improve education  all while consistently being voted the nicest member of Congress, Obama said in a statement., House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Capps a steadfast champion for protecting public lands, providing affordable education to all children and fighting for the resources families need to live healthier lives., Capps most notable work has been in healthcare and nursing. For example, she wrote a provision in 2000 giving grants for childrens dental care and a 2002 law providing scholarships and grants designed to train more nurses. She was named the nicest member of the House most recently in 2014 in a poll of congressional staff conducted by Washingtonian magazine., Her retirement opens a seat potentially viable for Republicans, but one that will be contested in a presidential year, in which Democratic turnout typically rises., The narrow slice of the Central Coast became more competitive in 2012 after redistricting. Democrats hold a narrow lead in party registration over Republicans, 37% to 34%, according to the California Target Book, a nonpartisan election compendium. More than 1 in 5 voters registered as nonpartisan., Capps won with 52% of the vote in November. The Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan political handicapper, said Wednesday that the seat remains likely Democratic, even after Capps retirement. But Allan Hoffenblum, publisher of the Target Book, said he believes it will be competitive enough that Republicans will consider it a target, especially if the GOP fields a strong presidential candidate to draw Republican voters to the polls., Santa Barbara Mayor Helene Schneider, a Democrat, jumped into the race on Wednesday, hours after Capps departure was announced. Another potential Democratic contender is Capps daughter Laura Burton Capps, a former speechwriter for Bill Clinton who also served as an aide to Sens. John F. Kerry and Edward M.

{"Content": "[[, Rep. Scott Peters of San Diego had a major disadvantage in seeking the endorsement of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for Novembers midterm election: Hes a Democrat., The views of the nations largest business group are closely aligned with the Republican Partys. And the GOPs reputation as the \"party of business\" has been strengthened in recent years as President Obama and Democrats tightened regulations and bashed Wall Street in the wake of the financial crisis., But a tea party-led debt limit fight and a partial federal government shutdown, along with conservative opposition this year to business community priorities such as immigration reform and reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, have tarnished that image., Democrats believe the door is open for them to break the Republicans stranglehold on business support. Its an uphill battle because of the Republican Partys core focus on low taxes and light regulation. But recently there have been signs of hope for Democrats., After failing to get the Chambers backing in 2012, for instance, Peters was among a handful of business-friendly Democratic congressional candidates this year to win its endorsement., \"There are very serious things that the business community sincerely wants us to handle, and many times its the Republicans who are part of the tea party or Republicans who are scared of the tea party who are standing in the way,\" he said., \"I think businesses are starting to realize that sometimes its the Democrats willing to push that agenda more than the Republicans,\" said Peters, a freshman whose GOP opponent this fall, Carl DeMaio, is sympathetic to some tea party positions., Democrats said businesses should give their partys candidates another look., \"I want to say to the business community, I think blind dedication to Republicans is a serious mistake,\" said Rep. Sander Levin (D-Mich.)., He called the recent battle over reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank, which helps U.S. companies sell their products abroad, \"mind-boggling.\", The agency doesnt require taxpayer funding and helps level the field for U.S. firms because dozens of foreign countries offer similar assistance to their companies. Business groups supported a five-year extension championed by Obama and congressional Democrats., But conservatives slammed the bank as an example of \"crony capitalism\" and a dispenser of \"corporate welfare\"  terms usually uttered by liberals., With the bank in danger of shutting down if its charter wasnt reauthorized by Sept. 30, House Republican leaders gave in to heavy business lobbying and allowed a nine-month extension to be included in a budget bill that passed last month., \"I think the fight over the Ex-Im Bank was a flare in the night sky about the coming battle,\" said Jonathan Cowan, president of Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank., \"There could be a big clash ahead over whats in the business communitys interest for economic growth and what some significant portion of the Republican Party is willing to support,\" he said., Democrats have a difficult task convincing executives, small-business owners and trade associations that the party is better for them than Republicans are., The six Democratic congressional candidates the chamber endorsed this year is one more than in 2012. But its far below the 28 the group endorsed in 2008. The rest of the Chambers 280 nods go to Republicans, said Chamber spokeswoman Blair Latoff Holmes., \"There is a lot of talk about how there is a war going on within the Republican Party, but the reality is, there arent many Democrats left who are pro-business and earn the Chambers endorsement,\" she said., Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) said that businesspeople hes met with have been critical of Republicans in private but unwilling to go public., \"We had a meeting with all these businesses and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, talking about the Ex-Im Bank,\" he told reporters last month. \"We sit there and theyre just moaning and groaning about the House Republicans.... I finally said to the Chamber of Commerce, When are you going to hold a press conference and say that?\", Carlos Gutierrez, a former Kellogg Co. chief executive who was Commerce secretary under President George W. Bush, said he still believes that Republicans are much more pro-business than Democrats., But recent hard-line party stands against immigration reform and the Export-Import Bank have not helped that reputation, said Gutierrez, who started a political action committee called Republicans for Immigration Reform., \"Businesspeople are very frustrated with the Republican Party in that they dont get it that immigration reform is a business issue,\" he said. \"Republicans see it as a rule-of-law issue and a social issue.\", Last year, the Senate passed a bipartisan bill to overhaul the immigration system, including increasing visas for high-tech workers, revamping farm labor programs and strengthening border security., The legislation had strong backing from business groups but stalled in the Republican-controlled House because of stiff conservative opposition to some provisions, such as a 13-year path to citizenship for qualified immigrants., Tea party conservatives have pushed the Republican Party away from business-friendly positions on key issues, centrist Cowan said. That provides an opening to Democrats if they can move away from the anti-big business sentiments of the partys liberal wing, he said., In San Diego, Peters has accused DeMaio of hiding his \"allegiance to the tea party.\", DeMaio is a self-described \"proud gay American\" who bills himself as a reformer willing to take on his own party., In a recent TV ad, DeMaio said he was not a \"tea party extremist.\" On immigration reform, for example, DeMaio said in an interview that he wanted to \"cool the Republican rhetoric,\" which he described as disrespectful., Still, hes fiscally conservative and some of his views are similar to tea party positions that have angered business groups. He wants the border secured before lawmakers start overhauling the immigration system, and he wants a \"bevy of reforms\" in any Export-Import Bank reauthorization to make sure it helps small businesses., John Raymond, a Republican who runs an Escondido real estate firm, said he contributed $1,000 to Peters campaign because he found him \"intelligent and thoughtful\" after they served on two San Diego boards., \"Business and the revenues created thereby is what funds government,\" Raymond said. \"Scott understands that. You can talk to him about those issues, and he gets it.\", Peters said he showed during his first term that he was willing to work across party lines on pro-growth policies., \"Not that theres not extremism in both parties, but there are a lot of moderates in the Democratic Party who want to sit down and make this country competitive, spur job growth here, promote exports, and I think businesses are starting to pick up on it,\" Peters said., jim.puzzanghera@latimes.com, Times staff writer Lisa Mascaro in Washington contributed to this report.]", "Date": "20141024", "Title": "[Democratic candidates seek gains from Republicans' tarnished business image]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-business-elections-20141024-story.html", "Author": "[Jim Puzzanghera]"}

{"Content": "[[, Republican Dan Sullivan has won Alaskas U.S. Senate race, defeating incumbent Democrat Mark Begich, officials said., Sullivan led Begich by about 8,100 votes on election night last week, and when state officials counted absentee and questioned ballots Tuesday, the results indicated that Begich could not overcome Sullivans lead., The Alaska seat was initially considered key to Republicans hopes of taking control of the U.S. Senate, but that was accomplished election night with GOP victories in other states., Sullivan, a first-time candidate, ran a confident campaign, ignoring the debate schedule Begich released during the primary and setting his own agenda. He also attracted some star power to the state, with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a tea party favorite, and 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney rallying support for Sullivan in the waning days of the hotly contested race., Sullivan pledged to fight federal overreach, talked about the need for an energy renaissance in the U.S. and, at seemingly every opportunity, sought to tie Begich to President Obama and Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, who are unpopular in Alaska., Begich complained that Sullivan offered little in the way of proposals for what he would do as senator. Begich also tried to paint sharp contrasts between himself and Sullivan in areas such as womens health, education and Alaska issues., Begich, for example, was born and raised in Alaska. He cast Sullivan, who grew up in Ohio, as an outsider, and many of the early attacks by pro-Begich groups keyed in to that theme. That perception of Sullivan made for an at-times uncomfortable debate on fisheries issues, in which questioners grilled Sullivan about his knowledge of one of Alaskas most important industries., On several occasions, Sullivans wife, Julie Fate Sullivan, an Alaska native and frequent companion on the campaign trail, appeared in ads defending her husbands ties to the state and his positions on womens issues., Sullivan has roots in Alaska dating to the 1990s but was gone for nearly seven years for military service and work in Washington that included working as an assistant secretary of State. He returned to Alaska in 2009, when he was appointed attorney general by then-Gov. Sarah Palin., He most recently served as Alaskas natural resources commissioner, a post he left in September 2013, to make his first run for public office., Sullivan hit the ground running, exhibiting a fundraising prowess that rivaled and during some quarters exceeded that of Begich. Many of his supporters cited his service in the Marine Corps reserves or the oft-repeated GOP refrain that became of a hallmark of the campaign -- that Begich voted with Obama \"97% of the time,\" a figure that takes into account votes during 2013, many of them on confirmations, on which Obama stated a preference., Sullivan said he was humbled by the support he received and publicly sought to tamp down expectations, even as campaign members expressed great confidence in a victory in the lead-up to Tuesday and said Democrats much-talked-about ground game wasnt all it was made out to be., Tens of millions of dollars were pumped into the state, with Republicans seeing Begich as vulnerable and Democrats trying to hold the seat Begich won in 2008. Voters were barraged by calls and ads, which many said they were turned off by., Sullivan emerged from a hard-fought three-way GOP primary to take on Begich, who had token opposition. Begich focused during that race on bolstering his homespun image, casting himself as an independent thinker unafraid to stand up to Obama, and as a lawmaker with a record of working across party lines, including with Alaskas senior senator, Republican Lisa Murkowski. Murkowski, who backed Sullivan after the primary and is in line to chair the Energy and Natuarl Resources Committee when Republicans take over the Senate, told Begich to knock it off., A turning point, in the view of many observers, came shortly after the primary in an ad from Begichs campaign that painted Sullivan as soft on crime. It featured a man identified as a former Anchorage police officer standing outside the home where an elderly couple was beaten to death and a family member sexually abused in 2013. It ended with the man saying Sullivan should not be a senator., The ad, which Sullivan responded to with one of his own, was pulled following a demand from an attorney for the victims family., Begich, in discussing the ad, said Sullivan had a \"pattern when he was attorney general of doing these plea deals that let violent offenders, sexual offenders out earlier than they should be.\" He said Sullivans record as attorney general needed to be scrutinized, but that didnt become a major focus of TV ads by his campaign and surrogates., Instead, some of the strongest criticism of Sullivan was in regard to his residency, his support of a permitting bill that critics said would have limited public participation in the states permitting process and his stance on abortion.]", "Date": "20141112", "Title": "[Republican Dan Sullivan wins Senate race in Alaska]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-alaska-dan-sullivan-20141112-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}

Jeb Bushand the GOPs 2012 nominee,Mitt Romney, both called Saturday for the Confederate battle flag to be removed from the grounds of the South Carolina statehouse, pushing debate over the divisive symbol to the forefront of the Republican primary., Romney wrote on Twitter that many see the Confederate flag as a \"symbol of racial hatred\" and called for itsimmediate removal. \"Remove it now to honor #Charleston victims,\" Romney wrote., Bush, who formally announced his candidacy last week, was more measured, notingin a Facebook postthat in his home state of Florida, the Confederate flag was moved from state grounds \"to a museum where it belonged.\"Bush appeared to favor the same approach for South Carolina., \"This is obviously a very sensitive time in South Carolina,\" Bush wrote, adding that after a \"period of mourning\" for those killed at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, there will \"rightly be a discussion among leaders in the state about how South Carolina should move forward and Im confident they will do the right thing.\", South Carolina Sen.LindseyGraham, who is also running in the Republican primary and serves alongside Scott, said the focus on the flag was misplaced.

{"Content": "[[, Republicans are waking up Wednesday morning with victories to celebrate but sobering realities to ponder., Winning control of the Senate after eight years of trying is a big prize, made more sweet by the fact that only two years ago, the party seemed on the ropes. Republicans also expanded their ranks in the House and, pending several late races, could end up with their biggest majority since Harry S. Truman left the White House., But even before the votes were counted, some of the GOPs leading strategists had begun to warn that those victories could blind Republicans to hard problems that the 2014 campaign had done almost nothing to solve. The barriers to a Republican victory in a presidential election remain formidable, they said., JOIN OUR VIDEO DISCUSSION THURSDAY AT NOON, \"We shouldnt be gloating over the fact of winning red states,\" said Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, noting that this years Senate battles mostly took place in reliably conservative states in the South and interior West. \"Thats not a very high bar.\", One-third of the Senate comes up for reelection every two years, and by luck of the draw, the states in this years batch are disproportionately conservative. Indeed, of the three classes of Senate seats, this years group has been the least representative of the country over the last few election cycles, according to an analysis of election data by Patrick J. Egan, a political scientist at New York University., A win is a win, no matter the caveats. The GOP has solidified its dominance of the South, strengthened its hand in Washington and further weakened President Obamas ability to influence the national agenda., And the GOP wave washed beyond red states. Republicans won Senate contests in Colorado, Iowa and North Carolina, all swing states. Two high-profile Republican governors, Scott Walker in Wisconsin and Rick Scott in Florida, won reelection in races shaped heavily by national partisan issues., But amid the victories, the limits of the Republican tide were also clear. In New Hampshire, a long-established swing state, GOP challenger Scott Brown failed to beat Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. Earlier in the election cycle, Republicans had largely given up their hopes of taking Democratic Senate seats in more solidly blue states, including Michigan, where longtime Sen. Carl Levin is retiring, and Minnesota, where incumbent Al Franken won an extremely narrow victory in 2008. Democrat Gary Peters prevailed in Michigan, and Franken easily won reelection., Newhouse, who was Mitt Romneys chief pollster, cautioned that the victories Republicans achieved Tuesday should not distract them from the reality that \"the image of the Republican Party has actually gotten worse since the end of 2012.\", The single biggest problem the party continues to face is the perception among many Americans that Republican elected officials dont recognize  or care much about  the challenges faced by people who arent white and affluent. Thats a severe handicap in a country where the electorate, particularly in presidential contests, is increasingly nonwhite and suspicious of wealthy businesspeople., \"The Republican Party brand sucks, and so people dont want to be a Republican,\" Sen. Rand Paul bluntly said last week during a campaign appearance in Detroit. \"Why?\" asked Paul, who hopes to become the partys presidential nominee in 2016. \"The problem is the perception ... that no one in the Republican Party cares.\", Polls show that view to be particularly common among younger Americans, minorities and unmarried women. Those three overlapping groups, along with college-educated white liberals, form the core of the coalition that elected Obama. And the Democrats already-huge advantage among some of those groups has expanded since the last midterm election., Just before the 2010 midterm, nonwhite likely voters preferred Democrats for Congress over Republicans by 70% to 21%, according to an analysis by the Pew Research Center. By last week, that preference had grown to 77% to 15%, a 62-percentage-point advantage., Smaller shifts toward the Democrats took place among likely voters earning less than $30,000, those with postgraduate degrees and those younger than 50., Among all voters, only 39% of registered voters had a favorable image of the GOP, with 55% viewing the party unfavorably., The Democrats standing, by contrast, is merely mediocre  48% unfavorable, 47% favorable in the Pew survey., \"No major party has ever been as unpopular in the history of polling as the Republican Party is,\" pollster Mark Mellman said at a recent discussion sponsored by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank. Mellman is one of the Democrats most prominent pollsters, which would make his judgment on the GOP suspect but for the fact that many Republican strategists share it., Republicans have been able to make gains this year in large part because voters tend to use midterm elections to vent frustrations at the party in the White House. Presidents Reagan, Clinton and George W. Bush all saw their party lose control of the Senate during midterm contests., The GOP has also benefited from the nature of the Democratic electoral coalition, built around younger voters and minorities, which suffers much more from the typical drop-off of voters between presidential and midterm contests., Take Milwaukee as an example. The largest city in one of the nations most closely divided states, its residents, 55% of whom are nonwhite, vote overwhelmingly for Democrats. In the 2012 presidential race, 72% of the citys voting-age citizens showed up to vote. Two years earlier, in the 2010 midterm, only 47% did, according to an analysis by the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel., Similar swings can be seen in other urban centers in battleground states., Because the voting preferences of older and younger Americans diverge much more than they used to, and Democrats rely more heavily on the young, the country now has two very different electorates. One shows up during midterms and the other  younger, less white, less conservative and bigger  turns out in presidential years., None of that means a Republican cant win the next presidential contest., \"No party has a permanent lock,\" says GOP pollster Whit Ayres. But reorienting the party \"requires a presidential candidate running with a different message,\" much as \"Bill Clinton did in 1992,\" he said., Republicans had little incentive to forge that kind of message this year. Obamas unpopularity, particularly in conservative states, gave their candidates all the arguments they needed., But that meant the party had little incentive to resolve divisions on high-profile topics, including immigration and healthcare, or to persuade people other than committed partisans that Republicans have solutions for the nations problems., Instead, the campaign has only deepened a sense, expressed by voters repeatedly in polls and focus groups this year, that neither party has an answer to what ails the nation., In both the 2006 and 2010 midterms, polls showed that voters had a clear preference for which party should run the government. By contrast, a Gallup survey released Monday delivered a very different message., On the eve of the GOPs victory, the poll found that barely 1 in 4 voters thought Republican control of Congress would make the country better.

We need someone who can actually get the job done., And for Carly Fiorina, the former business executive who graduated to the main debate after a shining performance in last months undercard forum, it meant dismissing Trump as an entertainer while positioning herself as someone who could withstand the grind of a national campaign., Trump seemed to nod toward humility in his opening statement, eschewing a braggadocious style, but he quickly reverted to form. He zinged Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul over his low poll numbers after Paul called him sophomoric, and he noted that Walker went down the tubes in Iowa., At one early point, as he and Bush sparred, Trump tweaked his rival by acknowledging Bushs newly aggressive approach: More energy tonight. I like that., For the sprawling cast of Republican presidential contenders running in Trumps shadow, the debates in Simi Valley offered a chance to make their cases before a television audience likely in the tens of millions., But it also emerged as a test of viability for once-touted contenders whove been upstaged by political outsiders, and others suddenly struggling to demonstrate they still belong in the conversation at all., It also proved to be something of an endurance test for the leading contenders, as they answered questions for more than three hours on topics including immigration and abortion, terrorism and the Iran nuclear deal, and even vaccinations and which woman should appear on the $10 bill., But once again it was Trump at the front and center, both literally and figuratively. The urgency of confronting him was clear immediately. In the preliminary debate among four GOP hopefuls lagging in the polls, Trump was not present but was frequently discussed., The best way for us to give this election back would be to nominate a Donald Trump, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal charged. Hell implode in the general election., In the main debate, Trump was flanked this time by Bush and Dr. Ben Carson, another surging candidate who has confounded race handicappers. He highlighted his personal story and outsider status with a much softer tone than Trumps., When I entered this race, all the political pundits said its impossible, he said. But the pundits forgot about one thing, and that is the people. And they are really in charge., Staged before the blue and white Air Force jet that Ronald Reagan flew in as president, the clashes revealed the extent to which the Gippers political party has broken with him in practice, even as many continued to speak reverently of him. Reagan signed a major immigration reform bill during his two terms, and even openly referred to the policy as amnesty, for instance., South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of the co-sponsors of a comprehensive immigration reform plan that passed the Senate in 2013, challenged others on immigration during a well-reviewed performance where he flashed a self-effacing sense of humor., In my world, Hispanics are Americans, he said., Bush also used immigration to challenge Trump directly, contrasting what he said was the Reagan-style optimistic approach with the Trump approach that says that everything is bad. He demanded Trump apologize to his wife, a Mexican American, for invoking her during the campaign. Trump declined to do so, insisting he had done nothing wrong., When Fiorina took Trump on, it was when asked to respond to Trumps disparaging remark over her appearance. I think women all over the country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said, she said., By necessity more than by choice, the candidates also broke the so-called 11th Commandment long attributed to Reagan  that thou shalt not speak ill of a fellow Republican. CNNs Jake Tapper, the lead questioner Wednesday, delivered on his pledge to force the candidates into direct confrontation., But some strategically stayed out of the fray., If I were sitting at home and watching the back-and-forth, I would be inclined to turn it off, Ohio Gov.

{"Content": "[[, Republicans finally won House approval Wednesday for a late-term abortion ban after dropping rape provisions that provoked a rebellion by female GOP lawmakers, forcing party leaders into an embarrassing retreat., The near party-line 242-184 vote was a victory for abortion opponents and a relief for top Republicans. Yet the path to passage took months of negotiations among anti-abortion groups, female lawmakers and party leaders, underscoring how tough it will be for the GOP to satisfy abortion foes while retaining support from women voters for next years elections., House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) called the bill the most pro-life legislation to ever come before this body, adding, We should all be proud to take this stand today., Even with House passage, the measure stands little chance of becoming law. Its fate is uncertain in the more moderate Senate, and President Obama probably would veto it. The bill is chiefly a platform for both parties to signal their abortion stances to their supporters., White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the measure contrasted with the usual Republican demands for keeping government out of peoples lives. The bill continues to add a harsh burden to survivors of sexual assault, rape and incest who are already enduring unimaginable hardship, he said., The legislation would forbid most abortions starting with the 20th week of pregnancy., In January, Republican leaders abruptly postponed a vote on the original version, which permitted rape victims to have abortions only if theyd reported the assault to police. The new bill instead requires those women to receive medical care or counseling at least 48 hours before an abortion., Republican women and moderates objected that the initial bill clamped harsh requirements on women making stressful decisions and could make the GOP seem callous., This has a much less punitive substance to it, said Rep. Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.), whod objected to the earlier rape reporting language. Its important that when we look at the care of women who are in crisis that we make sure theyre totally taken care of., The January delay was particularly awkward for GOP leaders because that vote was to occur the day abortion opponents attend the annual March for Life in Washington. Wednesdays vote came on the second anniversary of the murder conviction of Kermit Gosnell, a Pennsylvania abortion doctor, in the deaths of three babies killed with scissors after delivery., Just four Republicans and four Democrats crossed party lines in Wednesdays vote, which immediately became fodder for the emerging 2016 campaigns., Hillary Rodham Clintons presidential campaign said such decisions should be left to a woman, her family and her faith., National Right to Life said the vote showed most Democrats believe painfully dismembering babies is acceptable, adding, Now let them try to explain that to their constituents., To help win support from anti-abortion lawmakers, the revamped measure has new protections for fetuses., If a doctor believes the fetus could survive outside the womb, a second doctor must be present to care for it. Women would have to sign consent forms describing the fetus age and the steps to be taken to save its life., Republicans named the legislation the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, citing what they said is evidence that fetuses at 20 weeks can feel pain., Its time to open our eyes and allow our consciences to catch up with our technology, said Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), the chief sponsor., Abortion rights advocates say the measure violates womens privacy and cited doctors groups like the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which has gathered evidence that fetal pain is unlikely until weeks later., You want to talk about pain? Lets talk about the agony of a woman whos raped and again violated by unnecessary government intrusion, said Rep. Lois Frankel (D-Fla.)., The 1973 Supreme Court Roe vs. Wade decision established a constitutional right to abortion but allowed states to bar the procedure after viability, the point at which the fetus could survive if born. Disputes over when viability is reached have provoked numerous legislative battles ever since., Forty-two states bar abortions after certain points in pregnancies, including 10 with bans at 20 weeks, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports access to abortion., Statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that of 730,000 reported abortions in 2011, 1.4%  or about 10,000  were performed after 20 weeks of pregnancy., As with the original bill, the new measure permits abortions for minors who were victims of incest if the assault is reported to police or government agencies serving targets of child abuse. It allows no exemption for adult victims of incest.]", "Date": "20150513", "Title": "[House approves Republican bill banning most late-term abortions]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-house-antiabortion-bill-passes-20150513-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, Republicans trying to unseat Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris share a common complaint: The two Democrats are so confident of reelection that theyre already laying ground to run for governor in 2018., \"Shes looking right past us,\" David King, a Harris challenger, told a recent gathering of Republican women in Thousand Oaks., Newsom and Harris, two of the best-known Democrats on the June 3 ballot, insist theyre taking nothing for granted. Both deny theyre focused on 2018., But the weak standing of their Republican challengers, all of them far behind in both fundraising and name recognition, is emblematic of this years lopsided and low-key California elections, with Democrats well-positioned to keep their grip on every statewide office., It has also fueled speculation about whether a clash between Newsom, 46, and Harris, 49, the leading San Francisco politicians of their generation, is inevitable., \"Theres no doubt in my mind that theyre on a collision course for running for governor in 2018,\" said Garry South, a former Newsom consultant who was chief political strategist for former Gov. Gray Davis., Much can change in Californias election climate over the next four years. Among the biggest unknowns: Will Sen. Barbara Boxer, 73, seek reelection in 2016, and will Sen. Dianne Feinstein, 80, run for another term in 2018?, If either Senate seat opens up, the calculus could shift for Newsom, Harris, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and other Democrats weighing a run for governor., For now, Newsom and Harris appear minimally engaged in the June 3 primary, apart from raising money that  if they dont need it this year  can be rolled into a 2018 campaign., \"It seems remarkably quiet,\" Newsom said. \"Its surreal.\", The torpor is due largely to the states highest-profile contest. No Republican or member of any other party, so far, is posing a serious threat to Gov. Jerry Brown. In the most recent Field poll, the Democrat was running a staggering 40 percentage points ahead of his top challenger, Republican Assemblyman Tim Donnelly of Twin Peaks, a tea party favorite., Nationally, Republicans are in relatively strong shape as they try to recapture the U.S. Senate in a year when President Obamas popularity is low. But in California, the huge fundraising lead that Newsom and Harris have each established over Republican rivals underscores how hard it is to bounce a Democrat from statewide office in the deeply blue state., In March, when the most recent complete fundraising reports were filed, Newsom showed $1.9 million in cash on hand, and Harris $3.2 million. Since then, labor unions, lawyers, Silicon Valley executives, hedge fund managers and others have given an additional $171,000 to Newsom and $400,000 to Harris., For Harris four Republican challengers, money has been harder to get. They reported a total of zero cash on hand in March. Two of Newsoms were also empty-handed; the third had $62 in the bank., Since then, the seven Republicans combined have reported raising just over $31,000, making it close to impossible for any of them  or for the six others on the ballot for attorney general or lieutenant governor  to mount a viable campaign in a state with nearly 18 million voters., But theyre trying to make do., At the Thousand Oaks golf club gathering, King and another Republican Harris opponent, former state Sen. Phil Wyman of Tehachapi, took turns bashing the attorney generals record in remarks to members of Conejo Valley Republican Women Federated., Wyman reminded the crowd of his proposal to punish elected officials convicted in corruption cases involving gun violence with execution by public hanging, firing squad or lethal injection. \"Thats what I stand for, the rule of law,\" he told the group., King, a San Diego attorney active in local Republican politics, rolled his eyes when asked about Wymans long-shot candidacy. As for his own, he said: \"I jumped in because we dont have a credible candidate, and I dont believe in surrendering a state.\", Former state Republican chairman Ron Nehring offered a similar rationale for his own candidacy for lieutenant governor., \"Gavin Newsom treats this office like it is a taxpayer-funded gubernatorial exploratory committee for 2018, and everybody knows that,\" said Nehring, whose campaign road trip from San Diego to Santa Maria on Wednesday included a dinner stop at Pea Soup Andersens in Buellton., For Harris, the non-campaign is a welcome reversal of fortune. In 2010, her victory margin was so narrow  less than 1%  that it took more than three weeks of vote counting to win a concession from Republican rival Steve Cooley, at that time L.A. Countys district attorney., Nearly every law enforcement group in California had lined up against her after she refused, as San Franciscos D.A., to seek the death penalty in prosecuting the killer of city Police Officer Isaac Espinoza., But in her reelection run, Harris has won the support of police unions and prosecutors around the state, including the Republican district attorneys of San Bernardino and San Diego counties., Her office affords Harris constant opportunities to reinforce her law-and-order credentials. She recently announced 41 arrests in San Joaquin Valley drug raids, with 200 agents seizing guns, methamphetamine, cocaine, marijuana, ecstasy and $83,000 in cash., At a recent sex-trafficking symposium on the Westside, Harris recalled her work in the 1990s as an Alameda County prosecutor on homicide and child sexual-assault cases. \"Ive stood before many juries, talking about why there should be consequence and accountability,\" she said., Newsoms job, with its limited powers, is often a struggle for relevance, particularly for a onetime San Francisco mayor who drew worldwide headlines a decade ago when he ordered the city to sanction same-sex weddings., Tensions with the governor make matters worse: Brown has ignored Newsoms plans for improving Californias economy., Before abandoning his campaign against Brown in the 2010 primary for governor, Newsom mocked his rivals quest to regain the job hed first won in 1974 as a \"stroll down memory lane.\" In February, Newsom needled him further by withdrawing support for Browns prized high-speed rail project., But Newsom, whose family ties with Brown run deep, is circumspect when talking about the governor., \"He and I have a good interpersonal relationship,\" Newsom said. \"But I think the dynamics of the governors office with a lot of offices, one could sort of analyze and reflect on.\", Looking ahead to 2018, Newsom said that although people around him and Harris assume that their ambitions create friction, \"theres no real competitiveness.\", \"But invariably, in the future, thats to be determined,\" Newsom added. \"There may be a point where that presents itself, but I dont think about it much. And those that do, I tell them not to.\", Harris, who shares political advisors with Newsom, declined to talk about 2018., \"I am superstitious,\" she said. \"I believe you must do whats in front of you, and do it well, and the next thing will come.\", michael.finnegan@latimes.com]", "Date": "20140517", "Title": "[California GOP sees Democrats Newsom and Harris as sitting pretty]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-newsom-harris-20140518-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, Richard Trumka mentioned no names as he vowed recently that labor would not endorse yet another presidential candidate who talks big about confronting inequality but offers an agenda that merely fiddles around the edges of the economy, meeting Wall Streets needs before throwing workers scraps., Yet it was a clear warning to Hillary Rodham Clinton. Trumka, the AFL-CIO president, had just summarized the collective progressive angst around her., Clintons agenda is largely a mystery, reflecting a candidate who has not been engaged in domestic policy since the country first plunged into the Great Recession, and who is in no rush to box herself into positions., But the left is not giving her the benefit of the doubt. A day has not gone by since she launched her run three weeks ago without some group of progressives calling on her to make a pledge. That she will oppose the big Pacific trade agreement. That she will support a debt-free college plan. That she will commit to raising the minimum wage to $15., They want promises that she would upend the tax system, guarantee child care for everyone, expand Social Security., America doesnt need relentlessly cautious half-measures, Trumka said at his speech this week in Washington. Then he spelled out the consequences of an uninspired base: the door-knocking, phone banking and other mobilizing efforts that labor can offer in the general election may just not materialize., The message was clear. The coalition that propelled Barack Obama to victory is disenchanted, and it will fray with every step Clinton takes toward the center to appeal to swing voters., Clintons long association with liberal causes, from Hillarycare to family leave, is cold comfort to progressive organizers. So are her words on the campaign trail, where she has gradually sought to assure restive liberals that she is one of them, lamenting that the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top. One day her campaign hired Gary Gensler, a former regulator who is a nemesis of big banks, and another, as the Supreme Court considered gay marriage, it refashioned her avatar on Twitter as a rainbow flag., She also wrote the tribute when Time magazine named Clinton frenemy Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), the lefty standard-bearer and constant source of heartburn to Clintons campaign, one of its 100 most influential people. After Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont socialist, announced Thursday that he was running against her in the Democratic primary, Clinton tweeted that she agreed with him that the focus must be on helping Americas middle class., Clinton is running in a very different Democratic Party than she was eight years ago, and its base expects much more from her. Activists are angry that even the end of the recession is doing little to stem economic inequality. They resent her husbands legacy on the economy, saying Clintonian policies that emphasized creating opportunity over structurally lifting those workers at the bottom have resulted in chronically low wages and a deteriorating quality of life for too much of America., The problems have become so big that it feels to many of us like systemic solutions are required, said Deepak Bhargava, executive director of the Center for Community Change, which advocates for low-income Americans. Whether she is prepared to go there is an open question., It is all irritating to the Clinton campaign. Her advisors argue that the groups unfairly gloss over her lengthy record of pursuing liberal legislation and instead harp on Bill Clintons association with the Democratic Leadership Council, the pro-growth think tank that helped shape his economic agenda as president. The council shut down on the verge of bankruptcy in 2011, and the currency of its ideas in the Democratic party has withered., The idea generators likely to have the biggest effect in driving Hillary Clintons agenda now are at a very different group, the Center for American Progress. The think tank is an incubator for many of the policies that progressive organizations are pushing Clinton to adopt. Its founder, John Podesta, is Clintons campaign chairman. The current president of the center, Neera Tanden, was Clintons policy director in the last campaign., Just because Bill Clinton had some ideas in the 1990s, it doesnt mean Hillary Clinton is going to have the same ideas in 2015, Tanden said. I categorically reject that  these are new times with new challenges., A lengthy report that Tandens group released this year is putting some progressives at ease. It was notable not just because it acknowledges the growth-focused strategies pursued by Bill Clinton no longer adequately address stagnant wages and widening economic inequality, but also because of who wrote it. The co-author was Larry Summers, the relentlessly centrist Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton who played a key role in pushing the Democratic Party to the right in the 1990s., Now, Summers is warning of an erosion of democracy if unions are not strengthened and government does not pursue policies that force wage growth., Hillary Clinton could face a litmus test very soon. She is under pressure to take a position on a massive Pacific free-trade agreement sought by President Obama. Legislation supporting the pact is moving through Congress, and the left is mobilizing to fight it., This is a chance to separate herself from what people fear about her, which is a continuation of some of the Clintonian economic policies that did not work out so well, said Lawrence Mishel, president of the Economic Policy institute, a progressive think tank., For now, Mishel is reserving judgment. He said the candidate could yet delight liberal activists, noting that Clinton had the more progressive agenda when she ran unsuccessfully against Obama eight years ago. But he also pointed out that she would be spending a lot of time with Wall Street in the coming months, soliciting donations for her campaign., We just dont know where she is yet, he said. The unstated concern of some people, I think, is that she is too close to the financial center and needs to raise a lot of money. That can make someone shy about addressing the 1%. And it can push them into emphasizing opportunity over inequality., Twitter: @evanhalper]", "Date": "20150501", "Title": "[Liberals urge Clinton to go left, where she risks losing swing votes]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-hillary-clinton-liberals-conflict-20150501-story.html", "Author": "[Evan Halper]"}
{"Content": "[[, Rick Perrys Cameron Todd Willingham problem wont go away. In fact, it got worse this week., Until recently, much of the outrage over the killing of Willingham  the convicted murderer-arsonist who was very likely innocent but executed by Texas anyway in 2004  has been over the states and Gov. Rick Perrys conduct after Willingham was sent to death row in 1992 for setting the fire that killed his three children. Perry wasnt governor during Willinghams prosecution, which relied heavily on the testimony of a jailhouse informant and forensic evidence produced by arson investigators. But he was governor in 2004, when a noted arson expert and scientist sent him a report concluding there was no evidence that the fire was set intentionally and that the evidence used to convict Willingham amounted to junk science., Despite the report, Perry refused to grant a stay, and Willingham was put to death by lethal injection on Feb. 17, 2004. Five years later, with a Texas commission working inexorably toward a formal acknowledgment that the state had executed an innocent man  surely a watershed in the history of American capital punishment  Perry pulled a bureaucratic maneuver that effectively stopped the investigation in its tracks., (The seminal work of journalism on this subject appeared in the New Yorker in 2009. Its a depressing tale of Texas total indifference to the truth once Willingham landed on death row.), When Perry first ran for president in 2011, there were a few grumblings among pundits (myself included) about the Willingham case and what it said about Perrys ability to govern. Back then, I wrote that Texas may let Perry off the hook for executing an innocent man but the rest of the nation may not be so forgiving. How wrong (or naive) I was: Perrys campaign drew more attention for his memory slips and bizarre behavior than anything he did as governor of Texas. It seemed as if Perry  and Texas  had shaken off Willinghams ghost., Comes now a new report by the Washington Post that thoroughly discredits the final remaining piece of evidence used to convict Willingham: testimony by jailhouse informant Johnny Webb, who had said Willingham admitted his guilt while behind bars. The prosecutor who secured Willinghams conviction had insisted that he made no deal to persuade the informant to testify. But, according to a lengthy paper trail and the informant himself, Webb was indeed coaxed to testify against Willingham., We already knew the deck was stacked against Willingham after his conviction; what the Posts chilling report reveals is that the fix was in beforehand. None of the evidence used to send Willingham to the lethal injection gurney was credible; the longer Perry and his state continue to deny this, the more the case against Willingham will continue to unravel without their help., Perry is not running for reelection as governor of Texas, raising the likelihood that hes preparing a 2016 campaign for the White House. Judging by his finger-in-the-ears reaction to the questions over Willinghams guilt so far, either Perry is amorally unconcerned about sending an innocent man to his death, or hes so unsettled by the implications of a posthumous exoneration that he resorts to denial in the face of overwhelming evidence. I hope its the latter, which at least leaves open the possibility that some prolonged media exposure in parts of the country less at ease with capital punishment  and disgusted by the botched killings of late that have soiled lethal injections sterility  might make Perrys candidacy historic in ways he never intended., Follow Paul Thorntons Twitter feed @PaulMThornton, ]", "Date": "20140806", "Title": "[Cameron Todd Willingham's ghost won't stop haunting Rick Perry]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-cameron-todd-willingham-rick-perry-execution-20140806-story.html", "Author": "[Paul Thornton]"}
{"Content": "[[, Rick Santorum launched a 2016 White House bid on Wednesday, vowing to fight for working-class Americans in a new election season that will test his influence  and focus on social issues  in a changing Republican Party. , The former Pennsylvania senator may have exceeded his own expectations by scoring a second-place finish in the race for the Republican presidential nomination four years ago. Yet as he enters a more powerful and diverse 2016 field, he may struggle even to qualify for the debate stage. , I am proud to stand here, among you and for you, the American workers who have sacrificed so much, to announce that I am running for president of the United States, the 57-year-old senator said, flanked by factory workers and six of his seven children in a cinder-block warehouse inwestern Pennsylvania. , The last race, we changed the debate. This race, with your help and Gods grace, we can change this nation. , Santorum opens this political season as a heavy underdog in a race expected to feature more than a dozen high-profile Republicans  most of them newcomers to presidential politics. He is among the nations most prominent social conservatives, having dedicated much of his political career to opposing same-sex marriage and abortion rights, while advocating for conservative Christian \"family values.\", He mentioned cultural issues only briefly Wednesday, however, in remarks designed to broaden his appeal to working-class Americans. As president, I will stand for the principle that every life matters  the poor, the disabled and the unborn, said Santorum, a Catholic. , He ultimately won 11 states in the GOPs 2012 primaries after an unexpected and narrow victory in the opening contest in Iowa, where he emerged as a conservative favorite after touring the states 99 counties in a pickup truck. , His road to relevancy this time wont be easy. , Its going to be much more competitive, said Foster Friess, a prominent donor who was standing near the podium during Wednesdays announcement. , Santorum has acknowledged his challenges in 2016, but says his experience could pay dividends the second time around. Most of the GOPs presidential nominees in recent decades, Mitt Romney and Ronald Reagan among them, needed more than one campaign to win the nomination. , He faces considerable competition for his partys social conservatives in particular. The list of Republicans already courting religious voters includes former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a Baptist ministerwho won the Iowa caucuses in 2008; former Texas Gov. Rick Perry;Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. And, like Santorum, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is a Catholic. , Polling suggests a shift in voter attitudes about the importance of social issues, particularly gay marriage, which has long been a defining issue for Santorum. Like others in his party, he has appealed to religious voters recently by criticizing what he calls President Obamas war on religious freedom, which includes the broader debate over whether private businesses can deny services to same-sex couples. , Santorums long-shot status may keep him out of presidential debates altogether. , Only those who place in the top 10 of national polls will be allowed to participate in the first Republican presidential debate in August, according to guidelines released by network host Fox News. Santorum is on the bubble. , While advisors suggest he will benefit from a donor network that has grown in recent years, questions remain about Santorums ability to raise money. , Friess, who gave more than $2 million to a pro-Santorum \"super PAC\" in 2012, said he would continue to support Santorums White House ambitions, although he plans to avoid donating large amounts directly to the campaign or a supportive super PAC, both of which would disclose their donors. , Any giving Im doing is going to be lower-profile and less noticed, Friess told the Associated Press. , Santorum immediately launches a rollout tour that begins in Iowa on Thursday and Friday and moves to South Carolina on Saturday and Sunday. He is not scheduled to appear in New Hampshire, where voters typically dont favor candidates who focus on social issues. , A crowd of hundreds watched Santorums announcement at Penn United Technologies, an employee-owned manufacturing company based in the western Pennsylvania county where Santorum grew up. , Wallace Cypher, 54, who lives half a mile away, said hes backing Santorum because he wants a true conservative to win the GOP presidential nomination. , I think hed be a whole lot better than what weve got in there right now, Cypher said. , , 3:32 p.m.: This story was updated with details of Santorums official announcement., This story was originally published at 8:16 a.m.]", "Date": "20150527", "Title": "[Rick Santorum, announcing run for president, vows to fight for working class]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-rick-santorum-white-house-run-20150527-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}

Mark R. Warner of Virginia, who had been expected to coast to reelection but instead clung to a narrow lead., The party also bolstered its House majority and elected governors in the blue states of Maryland, Massachusetts and Illinois., As his partys defeats rolled in, President Obama invited congressional leaders from both parties to the White House on Friday afternoon., The incoming Senate majority leader, Kentuckys Mitch McConnell, sounded a conciliatory note in Louisville when he addressed supporters after his reelection victory Tuesday night., Tomorrow the papers will say I won this race. But the truth is, tonight we begin another one  one thats far more important than mine  and thats to turn this country around, McConnell told the crowd., I dont expect the president to wake up tomorrow and view the world any differently than he does now. He knows I wont either, McConnell said. But we do have an obligation to work together on the issues where we can agree. ... Just because we have a two-party system doesnt mean we have to be in perpetual conflict., The current Senate leader, Nevada Democrat Harry Reid, issued his own pledge of cooperation as he congratulated McConnell, a longtime adversary. The message from voters is clear, Reid said. They want us to work together. I look forward to working with Sen. McConnell to get things done for the middle class., McConnell also received a congratulatory phone call from Vice President Joe Biden, his former Senate colleague and a negotiating partner in recent years., With a few exceptions, most of election night was a coast-to-coast march of Republican victories, including a handful of breakthroughs for a party that has been tarred by Democrats as anti-woman. Voters in Iowa and West Virginia elected their first female senators, Joni Ernst and Shelley Moore Capito, and in Utah voters made incoming Rep. Mia Love the first black Republican woman ever elected to Congress., Republicans notched their first victories shortly after the polls closed in West Virginia. In Arkansas, Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor was quickly dispatched by GOP Rep. Tom Cotton. At 37, the Iraq combat veteran and Harvard Law School graduate will become the youngest member of the Senate., In Colorado, GOP Rep. Cory Gardner handily defeated first-term Sen. Mark Udall, signaling the partys vast improvement in the ground game that Democrats had perfected in Obamas two presidential victories., In two open-seat races, former Republican Gov. Mike Rounds was elected in South Dakota and Rep. Steve Daines won in Montana, easy pickups that Democrats had all but ceded by election day. The last incumbent to fall Tuesday night, giving Republicans Senate control, was Democrat Kay Hagan of North Carolina, who narrowly lost to state House Speaker Thom Tillis., In something of an anticlimax, Louisiana Rep. Bill Cassidy, a Republican, forced three-term Sen. Mary L. Landrieu into a Dec. 6 runoff., On an otherwise cheerless night, Democrats were buoyed by a victory in New Hampshire, where Sen. Jeanne Shaheen staved off a strong bid by Republican Scott Brown, a former Massachusetts senator who moved from the neighboring state expressly to challenge Shaheen., In contrast to 2010, when the GOP squandered a chance at retaking the Senate by nominating several gaffe-prone candidates seen as too extreme, this years crop for the most part managed to avoid fatal misstatements and pigeonholing on the far right  even if several were just as conservative as those earlier contestants., In House races across the country, the only question Tuesday was whether Republicans would pad their substantial majority. Most of the 435 contests on the ballot were devoid of competition, thanks to the artful drawing of congressional boundaries that protected most incumbents., There were exceptions, however, including contests in the Democratic strongholds of California and a race in Las Vegas, where the deteriorating national climate put the partys incumbents at serious risk., In West Virginia, Democratic Rep. Nick J. Rahall II lost his bid for a 20th term. In Georgia, Democratic Rep. John Barrow, a five-term conservative who had survived tougher cycles, was also defeated., Democrats picked up a key seat in the Florida panhandle when Gwen Graham, daughter of former Sen. Bob Graham, beat conservative Republican Rep. Steve Southerland II., But it was still a tough night overall for Democrats, as Rep. Joe Garcia lost in Florida and two Illinois Democrats, Bill Enyart and Brad Schneider, were also ousted by the GOP., In gubernatorial races, Texas Republican Greg Abbott easily defeated Wendy Davis, who became an overnight Democratic sensation after filibustering antiabortion legislation. Wisconsins GOP Gov. Scott Walker survived a tough challenge, positioning him for an expected 2016 run for president. Republican Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback also prevailed after a strong challenge., After a long night of counting, Floridas Republican Gov. Rick Scott edged past Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat Charlie Crist, and wealthy businessman Bruce Rauner toppled Democratic Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, giving the state its first Republican governor in a decade. , The voters who cast ballots Tuesday were a distinctly downbeat lot., Fewer than a third believed the country was on the right track. Fewer than half approved of the presidents job performance and fewer than 1 in 5 approved of the job Congress was doing, according to exit poll interviews., They cited the economy as their top concern and, despite months of favorable statistics, only 35% said they believed things were getting better., The unhappy mood matched  and perhaps partly grew out of  the ceaselessly negative tone of the campaign., Candidates and their super PAC supporters, freed by the courts from spending limits, poured nearly $4 billion into the election  a record  and flooded voters with more than 2 million television advertisements, most of them negative. In some bombarded states, commercial breaks were filled in the final campaign days with nothing but back-to-back political advertisements., But all of that did little to change the fundamentals this election season, which from the start tilted strongly in Republicans favor., The party out of power in the White House almost invariably wins congressional seats in a midterm election, when the contest becomes a referendum on the president and his policies. After nearly six tumultuous years  marked by recession, scandal, foreign crises, unceasing political warfare over healthcare and a string of disasters, natural and man-made  it was Obama whose unpopularity weighed heavily on fellow Democrats, to a point he was scarcely seen on the campaign trail., Also benefiting the GOP were the electoral math and the political map., Democrats started the year defending far more Senate seats than Republicans, and the hardest-fought contests were in states that Obama lost in 2012, several by double digits., In 2016, the two parties will find themselves on opposite footing. Of 34 Senate seats on the ballot, Republicans will be defending 24 and Democrats 10., mark.barabak@latimes.com, maeve.reston@latimes.com, Times staff writers Lisa Mascaro in Washington; Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, Rising Republican hostility toward President Obamas impending immigration plan is as intense as has ever existed between the White House and the GOP., House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio says the presidents executive action  expected to be announced Thursday  will \"poison the well\" for cooperation with the upcoming Republican-controlled Congress. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky compared it to \"waving a red flag in front of a bull.\" Tea party conservatives have renewed talk of censuring or impeaching the president., But the strong reaction by Republican leaders has less to do with opposition to the nuts and bolts of the presidents immigration policy and more to do with fear and anger that the issue will derail the agenda of the new Republican majority before the next Congress even convenes., Republican leaders who had hoped to focus on corporate tax reform, fast-track trade pacts, repealing the presidents healthcare law and loosening environmental restrictions on coal are instead being dragged into an immigration skirmish that theyve tried studiously to avoid for most of the last year., Thats largely because the question of how to handle the estimated 11 million immigrants living illegally in the U.S. bitterly divides Republicans, and the party has been unable to agree on an alternative to the presidents plan., To many, stark warnings from Boehner and McConnell sound more like pleas to the president to avoid reenergizing the GOPs conservative wing, whose leaders are already threatening to link the presidents immigration plan to upcoming budget talks., Another government shutdown is not what McConnell and Boehner had in mind when their party won control of Congress this month., In fact, McConnell said flatly a day after the election that another shutdown would not happen. But calls by firebrand Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) to use \"all procedural means necessary\" during Congress lame-duck session to block the White Houses immigration plans have left leaders scrambling to tame their rebellious ranks., Republican leaders are increasingly concerned that if Obama follows through, the anti-immigrant fervor in their party will rise to an unappealing crescendo and the rank-and-files desire to confront the president will overtake other party priorities., Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa)  one of the harshest critics of Obamas program that defers deportation for immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children  said he canceled plans to return to his district Thursday night as soon as he heard the president would be making an announcement., Although King said he wanted to see the full details of the presidents plan, he said Republicans should respond by passing a resolution of disapproval of the new policy, censuring the president and cutting off funding to enforce the policy. He did not rule out impeachment., \"I dont want to go down that path, because we have lived through that and it puts the nation through a lot of drama,\" King said. \"But it is the president who is initiating these actions.\", GOP leaders concerns about getting distracted by immigration are shared by the business community and outside groups that bankrolled the partys recent electoral success. High hopes that the new Republican Congress would tackle economic and business issues could be dashed if the party were goaded into an immigration fight., \"Were urging Republicans, whatever happens on immigration, lets also stay focused,\" said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, which is aligned with the billionaire Koch brothers and spent millions in the midterm campaign supporting Republican candidates for Congress. The group has not taken a position on immigration., \"We just want to make sure this economic agenda is not lost, because theres an enormous opportunity next year with Republicans who control the Senate and the House to ... pass significant legislation,\" Phillips said., Opponents of Obamas impending executive action want Congress to rescind funds for his immigration programs or use the upcoming government spending bill to block what they see as amnesty for millions of immigrants who would no longer be a priority for deportation., Some Republican lawmakers want to approve only a series of short-term spending bills, so they can revisit the issue every few months and maintain some leverage over the White House. But GOP leaders worry the tactic will bog down the new Congress in an endless immigration fight and bring back the shutdown politics that badly bruised the partys image last year., \"Its always appropriate to use the power of the purse, but its important to remember that the president has an important trump card: Its called the veto pen,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"Were not going to be able to get everything exactly the way we want it, and hes not going to be able to get everything exactly the way he wants it. Thats why we have compromise.\", The presidents expected announcement Thursday leaves Republican leaders with little time to contain the fallout before the Dec. 11 deadline to approve new funding to keep the government operating., One solution would be for Republicans to produce their own immigration bill to counter Obamas approach. That would accomplish two key party goals heading into the 2016 presidential election: help the party reach out to minority voters it needs to win the White House and show Americans the GOP can get Washington working again., But that is unlikely to happen. Although some lawmakers are quietly working on compromise immigration legislation, there are no immediate plans to bring those proposals forward amid deep differences in the Republican Party. A bipartisan immigration bill passed the Senate last year, but the GOP-controlled House refused to act on it., Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a Boehner ally, accused Obama of intentionally trying to provoke a fight with the new Republican Congress., \"Im mystified by the political calculation,\" he said. \"Theres a new Congress coming in. Why would you do this on the eve of Thanksgiving going into the holiday unless you just want to create a political crisis?\", lisa.mascaro@latimes.com, michael.memoli@latimes.com, @lisamascaro, @mikememoli]", "Date": "20141119", "Title": "[Obama's plan of action on immigration may derail Republican agenda ]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-immigration-fight-20141120-story.html", "Author": "[Lisa Mascaro, Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, Ron Paul spent much of his presidential campaigns serving as the crank on the debate stage. But here in Iowa in 2012, he finished a strong third, the beneficiary of an outpouring of libertarian love., Now his son Rand Paul has embarked on his own run for the White House, and he hopes to be embraced by his fathers passionate followers. But to avoid his fathers fate  at the end, less a serious contender than an asterisk  Rand Paul must pull off a far harder task, convincingnot only his fathers backers but voters of other stripes that they should side with him., Already in Iowa, where Paul campaigned Friday, the difficulties are obvious. Drew Ivers, who ran the fathers Iowa campaigns in 2008 and 2012, is undecided about whether he will support the son. He cites policy changes Rand Paul has made in his effort to broaden his appeal., His \"voting record is good, but his rhetoric over the last two years as he ramped up for his announcement has deviated from his voting record,\" Ivers said. \"He is sending some mixed signals.\", In other states and in other presidential election years, solidifying libertarian support would not be a priority. But with an enormous potential field of GOP candidates and the outsized voice of Iowans, who hold the first presidential nominating contest in the nation, consolidating their support is critical for a self-described \"libertarian-ish\" candidate like Paul. Even a small amount of defection could harm his chances, given the tiny number of Iowans who actually participate in the states caucuses., In 2012, about 121,000 GOP voters caucused here, with Ron Paul claiming 21% of the vote, 3% less than the winner, former Sen. Rick Santorum. Pauls ardent backers then engineered a hostile takeover of the state Republican Party, leading the lions share of Iowas delegates to cast ballots for the Texas congressman at the Republican National Convention., Political observers and even operatives who are supporting other candidates widely expect Rand Paul to hold on to many of these activists., The Rev. Glen Bandel, a part-time pastor at Nora Springs Christian Church, is among those who endorsed the elder Paul and plan to caucus for the son., \"Hes No. 1 on my list,\" said Bandel, 86. \"Theyre not the same. Theyre not identical. Theyre two separate individuals but theyve both got some pretty good ideas.\" Rand Paul, he said, \"looks pretty conservative.\", The candidate says retaining such backers is key to his prospects., \"The core of our organization in Iowa remains from my fathers supporters,\" Paul said in an interview, noting that he followed a similar playbook in his 2010 Senate race in Kentucky. \"The strategy to winning is to expand the group of followers that we had. The goal is to unite coalitions and to bring people together. Thats what Ive spent a lot of the last two years showing.\", But Pauls efforts during the lasttwo years are precisely what are turning off some of his fathers backers, such as Joel Kurtinitis. The 30-year-old served as a regional director for Ron Paul in 2012; this year he has signed on as a state co-chairman for Sen. Ted Cruz. The Texan, a tea party favorite who is Rand Pauls main rival among those voters, is aggressively courting the elder Pauls Iowa supporters., Kurtinitis said he was disappointed by some of Pauls recent political moves, such as backing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnells reelection over a tea party challenger, and playing \"identity politics\" as he tries to broaden his base., \"In terms of courage and conviction and integrity -- the things people loved about Ron -- being against the establishment, standing up to leaders of both parties, Cruz has really pulled away from the pack,\" he said. Rand Paul \"has in some ways passed up that opportunity in attempting to reach to the middle and attempting to seemingly please everyone.\", The tension has been on display in recent months. Last week, Paulproposed increasing defense spending by $190 billion over the next two years, a stark contrast from his earlier calls to slash military budgets. In interviews since he launched his presidential bid on Tuesday, Paul has been questioned about shifting his foreign policy views from non-interventionist to something more muscular. He has stumbled when asked about his position on abortion and foreign aid to Israel -- both areas in whichan answer that would endear him to evangelical voters would alienate some libertarians and millennials., \"Hes struggling with several issues between his libertarian heritage and his attempts to appeal to social conservatives,\" said Dianne Bystrom, director of the Carrie Chapman Catt Center for Women and Politics at Iowa State University. \"Those always dont mesh so well.\", However, Paul may enjoy one advantage in Iowa that his father did not -- the youth vote., Ron Paul sparked palpable enthusiasm on college campuses, where he was greeted more like a rock god than a slight congressman who was old enough to be most students grandfather. But in the last two presidential cycles, the caucuses occurred Jan. 3, when students were home for winter break., But next year, if the GOP nominating schedule holds, Iowas caucuses will take place in early February, offering all the candidates an opportunity to mobilize young supporters. Pauls brand of libertarianism, opposition to government spying tactics, and calls for reducing penalties for nonviolent drug use could make him a natural Republican beneficiary of this scheduling change., In a nod to this scenario, Paul on Friday held his first Iowa event as an official candidate at the student union at the University of Iowa., Paul called for making college tuition tax-deductible, and highlighted his opposition to government surveillance of phone and computer records, and to jail sentences for nonviolent drug users. He pledged to be a different kind of politician than the entrenched representatives of both parties in Washington., \"If we elect politicians that will say or do anything to get elected, whats the point? Why bother?\" Paul asked. \"If all politicians look alike, sound alike, dress alike, [offer the same] platitudes, why even bother voting? If we want the Instagram generation to get up off their sofas, to leave their dorm rooms and vote, someone needs to come forward and make it worth their while.\", Twitter:@LATSeema]", "Date": "20150411", "Title": "[In Iowa, Rand Paul's disparate 2016 needs collide to his detriment]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-rand-paul-2016-iowa-20150411-story.html", "Author": "[Seema Mehta]"}
{"Content": "[[, Running for president is not quite what it used to be., Candidates once had to rely on the support of party leaders, who assessed their electability; on a broad fundraising base to sustain them until victory brought in fresh cash; and on a handful of national news outlets to spread the word of their candidacy., No more., Major changes in the political system  especially campaign finance laws that allow rich people to write unlimited checks to certain political action committees  have drastically lowered the barriers to entry, as has the proliferation of social media., \"If youve got a Twitter account, a Facebook page and a millionaire to fund your super PAC, why not?\" said Jim Dyke, a veteran Republican strategist working for candidate Jeb Bush in South Carolina., The Reelz Channel has acquired the rights to broadcast the Miss USA pageant.

(AP), The Reelz Channel has acquired the rights to broadcast the Miss USA pageant. NBC dropped the pageant after co-owner Donald Trumps comments on Mexican immigrants. Reelz says the pageant will be broadcast on Sunday, July 12th. July 3, 2015. (AP), The result is more than a dozen declared Republican candidates  with others soon to follow  giving the party its largest pick of presidential contenders in memory and a roster of uncommon depth and experience., What the party lacks is a clear leader in the 2016 field  or anyone, for that matter, who can plausibly claim a meaningful advantage  producing what is arguably the most wide-open Republican race in more than 50 years., \"You have people who lead in polls,\" said Craig Robinson, a GOP analyst in Iowa, the state due to cast the first presidential votes in about seven months, \"but no front-runner.\", Indeed, an aggregate of surveys taken nationally as well as in Iowa and New Hampshire, the second state to vote, shows no candidate gaining the support of even a quarter of Republican voters interviewed., With the field likely to include at least four sitting governors, plus the ex-governors of three big states  Florida, New York and Texas  and four United States senators, the party hardly lacks for skilled and politically proven candidates., The faithful will inevitably rally around the eventual Republican nominee, uniting behind the shared goal of defeating the Democrats in November 2016 and winning back the White House after an eight-year absence., But until then, the supersized White House field points not just to the ease of entry but to the myriad fault lines within the party: between its establishment and insurgent wings, between social and economic conservatives, between its growing political base in the conservative South and shrinking toehold in the more moderate Northeast., \"We have polarization in the Republican Party,\" said Stuart Spencer, a GOP strategist with more than half a century of campaign experience. \"Just as we do in the nation.\", It is not unusual for a party out of power to look inward and debate what, if any, changes are needed to find its way back to success. (Republicans have lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential contests and havent won a sizable electoral college majority since 1988.), In 1992, after a string of Democratic losses, Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton won the White House running as \"a new kind of Democrat\" who was less beholden to the partys long-standing liberal orthodoxy. He declined to spare a death row inmate from execution, hoping to show his toughness on crime, and vowed to drastically overhaul the federal welfare system, which he did in his second term as president., No GOP candidates have gone as far as Clinton in taking on their own party. But several have nudged fellow Republicans in different ways: Bush, a former Florida governor, by urging the party to soften its tone on immigration; Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul by advocating a less assertive military policy; Ohio Gov. John Kasich by embracing the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, which is loathed by many Republicans., ------------, FOR THE RECORD, June 29, 12:15 p.m.: An earlier version of this articleincorrectly said Ohio Gov. John Kasich had embraced the expansion of Medicare., ------------, While those three and others seek to broaden the party and its appeal, some rivals, including Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, have suggested Republicans hold true to their long-standing positions and do a better job of turning out supporters who, they suggest, have been dispirited by too-quick-to-compromise nominees like John McCain and Mitt Romney., \"What Jeb Bush is saying is that we need to hide our conservative ideals,\" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said Wednesday in launching his presidential bid. \"But the truth is, if we go down that road again, we will lose again.\", Bush, with his universal name recognition and ready-made national network of political and financial supporters, was once considered a strong favorite for the nomination. But his less-than-stellar performance as a candidate and resistance among Republicans toward the notion of another Bush in the White House  following his father and older brother  have pushed him back among the rest of the pack., That, in turn, has encouraged others to jump into the Republican race, among them Kasich, who is expected to formally declare his candidacy by the end of summer., \"I thought Jeb was just going to suck all the air out of the room,\" Ohios governor told a group of New Hampshire business leaders this month. \"And it just hasnt happened.\", The last presidential race is instructive., Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum had lost his previous campaign, a 2006 Senate reelection bid, by a humiliating 18 points. He spent much of the early 2012 contest as a near-asterisk in polls. Still, Santorum nearly snatched the nomination away from the front-running Romney, thanks in good part to a lone financial benefactor who sustained Santorums campaign long after it once would have ended., Given that experience, there is every incentive for others, including several distinct long-shots, to hope they, too, can catch political lightning in 2016. (Santorum is among them, making his second try for the White House.), History is certainly on the Republicans side: It is rare for a party to win the White House three times in a row, and with President Obama stepping down, an open seat offers added enticement., \"If youre interested in running for president,\" said Steve Duprey, a longtime New Hampshire GOP activist, \"this is the time to do it.\", All but one of those seeking the Republican nomination will, of course, end up losing. But that may not be so bad, either: Save for the most off-putting candidates, the rewards may include higher speaking fees, a shot at their own cable TV show and maybe a slight edge should they run again four years from now., mark.barabak@latimes.com, Twitter:@markzbarabak, Declared major candidates, Jeb Bush, former Florida governor, Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon, Ted Cruz, senator from Texas, Carly Fiorina, former Hewlett-Packard CEO, Lindsey Graham, senator from South Carolina, Mike Huckabee, former Arkansas governor, Bobby Jindal, Louisiana governor, George Pataki, former New York governor, Rand Paul, senator from Kentucky, Rick Perry, former Texas governor, Marco Rubio, senator from Florida, Rick Santorum, former senator from Pennsylvania, Donald Trump, real estate developer, Expected candidates, Chris Christie, governor of New Jersey, John Kasich, governor of Ohio, Scott Walker, governor of Wisconsin]", "Date": "20150629", "Title": "[Lack of clear front-runner in huge 2016 field highlights fractures within GOP]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-gop-race-20150629-story.html", "Author": "[Mark Z.

{"Content": "[[, Russias ruble has been on a roller-coaster ride, posting the second-biggest drop in value of world currencies in 2014, then bouncing back this year with the highest rise against the dollar, euro, pound and yen., The rubles dizzying comeback, though, is due neither to an economic boom nor to sustainable intervention by the Russian Central Bank. And it came at a steep price., Steadying the ruble at about 50 to the dollar has drained the countrys hard-currency trove of $150 billion, more than a quarter of the reserves on hand at the end of 2013. Those cash infusions have done little to cheer Russian consumers or businesses: Inflation remains at more than 16% and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development predicts that the overall economy will shrink by 4.5% this year., And stabilizing the ruble was achieved only after President Vladimir Putin shook down Russias oligarchs for what he considered their fair share toward arresting the currencys tumble, a tactic unavailable to the stewards of a free-market democracy., \"There is no strategy and no vision. Its all live for today,\" said economist Sergei Guriev, a former rector of Moscows New Economic School living in self-imposed exile in Paris., Russias disappearing middle class and the working poor are paying the price for the Kremlins economic fiddling, Guriev said. He points to an average 10% drop in real income last year, a jump in mortgage defaults and rising food and utility prices., A $500-billion, decade-long military modernization program augurs even grimmer years to come., Car sales in Russia dropped 42% in April from the same month last year, the Assn. of European Businesses reported last month. The share of Russians who can afford no more than the absolute necessities has soared to 20%, the highest since polling on the subject began a decade ago, the Nielsen research firm reported last month., Even during the 2009 recession, the report noted, only 7% of respondents said they could afford nothing more than food and shelter., \"But people know not to blame Putin. They know it is all the fault of Obama and the Ukrainian fascists that they have to suffer economically to confront these evil people,\" Guriev said, mocking the prevailing public attitude molded by a lavishly funded propaganda campaign on state-run television., \"In Russia we say that theres the television and theres the fridge,\" said the economist, who until last year was part of the Kremlins financial inner circle. \"People believe what they see on television, but when they dont see anything in the fridge they stop believing. If the government doesnt have the cash it needs and sees that its propaganda is no longer convincing, it may embark on a new military adventure to make people believe again.\", The economy was ticking along with healthy growth in most recent years until Russian troops seized Ukraines Crimea region in 2014. The United States and the European Union imposed sanctions on Moscow for its violation of international law and its neighbors sovereignty., Those measures, which cut off international lending and blacklisted dozens of Kremlin kingpins, have coincided with the decline of world oil prices to half their value of a year ago. And in spite of repeated pledges by Putin to diversify the economy since he first took office in 2000, Russia remained dependent on oil and gas sales for more than half of its income when the latest financial crisis hit., The government in April revised its 2016 budget to take into consideration the decline in expected energy revenue, which originally had been calculated at $100 a barrel for oil. The deficit spending now envisioned for next year will eat up an additional $200 billion from the hard-currency reserves, and more if the military modernization project continues to be exempt from the budget cuts forced on almost every other economic sector., Putin has micromanaged the financial crisis in much the same away as he has guided the countrys geopolitical strategy. He summoned his nations captains of industry to the Kremlin for an emergency session Dec. 16, when the ruble was trading at 80 to the dollar. According to the RBK business journal, he told them that the rubles collapse threatened their welfare as well as that of the country and that they had an obligation to repatriate the money they had stashed in foreign banks., There was no official edict issued, and the journal observed that the Kremlin has limited means of controlling how oligarchs or ordinary citizens handle their finances., Putin did declare a \"capital amnesty\" after the December meeting, and the State Duma, the lower house of the parliament, has been struggling since then to draft legislation aimed at assuring offshore depositors that repatriating their capital wont lead to investigations of whether they came by it legally. A history of nationalizations, corruption and asset seizures has undermined faith in the security of Russia-based wealth, explaining the flight of more than $150 billion in capital last year alone., But lost on none of the oligarchs was the unspoken threat of reprisals if they failed to do their part to halt the rubles free-fall. Memories were still fresh of the September house arrest of oil magnate Vladimir Yevtushenkov and seizure of his assets, not to mention the 10 years that former billionaire Mikhail Khodorkovsky spent in prison for challenging Putins political domination., The billionaire owners of Lukoil, Severstal, Norilsk Nickel and three dozen other major enterprises had converted enough of their hard-currency holdings by late February to boost the rubles value to about 60 to the dollar. Igor Sechin, head of the oil monopoly Rosneft, told the Tass news agency that he had sold $93 billion for rubles in 2014., The winter run on the ruble was triggered by the converging effects of sanctions and the nadir in oil prices that flirted with $45 a barrel in December. Oil has lately traded for about $60 a barrel., Putin has brushed off sanctions as little more than an irritant and banned European food imports in retaliation. He has ordered major importers to buy Russian-made goods to replace the components they used to get from Western manufacturers, though domestic production cant ramp up to meet the new demand when the scant credit available from Russian banks comes with double-digit interest rates., As national coffers emptied late last year, Putin ordered 10% across-the-board cuts in government-funded services for regions and municipalities, with only pensions and the ambitious defense overhaul spared the budget ax., Government economists have revealed little about the brainstorming that goes on behind the Kremlins closed doors or their own candid views on Putins handling of the crisis. But academics and independent economists willing to comment from their lofty remove see little to suggest that the current problems will be short-lived., \"There is nothing good\" in the mid- or long-term forecast, concluded Alexander Savelyev, a senior scholar at the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of World Economy and International Relations. \"And the majority of experts expect further decline.\", Twitter: @cjwilliamslat]", "Date": "20150625", "Title": "[Putin manages to stabilize ruble, but Russian economy still staggers]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-russia-resilient-ruble-20150625-story.html", "Author": "[Carol J.

Steyer said he wanted to focus his time and money on fighting global warming., Villaraigosas hesitation, unfortunately for him, also is providing more time for other potential Democratic candidates to \"seriously consider.\" They include three U.S. House members from Southern California: Adam Schiff, 54, of Burbank; Xavier Becerra, 57, of Los Angeles, and Loretta Sanchez, 55, of Garden Grove., They have at least one advantage over Harris and Villaraigosa: Theyre experienced at raising campaign money under stringent federal rules, which limit individual donations to $2,600 per election. At last glance, Schiff had $2.1 million stashed and Becerra, $1.4 million., But to run, theyd have to surrender their House seats., Schiff, a moderate, would be most likely to draw Republican votes in the \"top-two\" open primary, giving him a chance to advance to the November runoff. Thats assuming there isnt a strong Republican candidate, which is a solid bet., Any House member, however, has a statewide identity problem that would take time and tens of millions to resolve. Also, two or more Southern California candidates could split the L.A. vote, which normally is subpar anyway compared with the Bay Area., Additionally, if either Becerra or Sanchez runs, it would pull Latino votes from Villaraigosa. A little history may be helpful here, however: Villaraigosa and Becerra both ran for mayor in 2001. Villaraigosa finished first in the primary; Becerra a distant fifth., Of course, Sanchez also could draw women from Harris., There are a lot of \"ifs\" and potential chess moves. But if Villaraigosa is actually going to run, the sooner he starts, the better for him. Right now, Harris is trotting unhindered., And shes the only one to have run statewide before, winning both of herraces., Villaraigosa has been itching to run statewide  principally for governor  ever since he was first elected to the Assembly in 1994., His performance as speaker offers one important clue as to what kind of senator he would be. He was a good one, especially given the debilitating effects of ill-conceived term limits, which then relegated Assembly members to only six years., During his two years as speaker, Villaraigosa was persistent, often productive and normally pleasant., He cut delicate deals on two big bond issues for schools and parks. He pushed through legislation enacting a Healthy Families Program that provided medical care for children of the working poor. He flexed his muscle to force passage of a bitterly fought bill limiting handgun purchases to one a month., And he delivered many millions in old-fashioned pork for L.A., including $5 million for the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Californians probably arent very squeamish  at least shouldnt be  about accepting pork from Washington. And Villaraigosa has shown he knows how to grab it., As mayor, Villaraigosa got mixed grades. He scored highest on transportation and safety but was disappointing on education reform and job creation. One legitimate excuse: He presided during the job-killing recession., His image was tarnished by an extramarital affair with a TV newscaster  not his first dalliance while married. So he has personal baggage, not an unprecedented burden for politicians., \"After Bill Clinton and Arnold Schwarzenegger,\" South says, \"the bar has been lowered pretty significantly on baggage.\", Villaraigosa would be Californias first Latino senator. He could generate excitement among the fast-growing Latino population, which hasnt been voting in nearly the proportion of other ethnic groups., And 2016 will be a presidential year, which always attracts a higher turnout of Democratic and minority voters than other elections., \"He doesnt have months to make a decision. Hes got two or three weeks at the outside,\" South says. \"You cant wait for an election to be delivered to you.\", If Villaraigosa really savors higher office, 2016 is his best window., Twitter: @LATimesSkelton]", "Date": "20150125", "Title": "[Villaraigosa's experience could play well in the Senate]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-cap-villaraigosa-senate-20150126-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, SACRAMENTO  Four years after calling for \"courage and sacrifice\" to dig California out of the depths of recession, Jerry Brown begins an unprecedented fourth term as governor Monday amid an economic rebound that has delivered near-record job growth and a state budget surplus., Ironically, those good fortunes are among many forces that could undercut, or certainly test, the Democratic governors ability to accomplish a series of goals that have been years in the making., Brown has pledged to avoid the temptation of launching costly new programs and to march forward on those already underway: building a bullet-train network, retooling state waterworks, reducing carbon emissions and addressing the towering costs of retirement benefits for public employees. The day after his November reelection, Brown said he was \"not going to get inhibited from doing great things.\", But new legislative leaders have vowed to restore services for the needy that were decimated during the recession, potentially diverting effort and money from other causes, and have their own ideas for reducing pollution and enhancing transportation. The University of California regents drew Brown into a firefight over higher education funding when they voted recently to increase tuition. And President Obamas executive action on immigration could lead to hundreds of millions of dollars in unanticipated state spending., \"The problem always is there are a lot of hungry birds in the nest that want to get fed,\" said outgoing state Treasurer Bill Lockyer, a Democrat, who has also served as state attorney general and leader of the state Senate., In the twilight of a political career that has spanned nearly half a century, Brown knows his agenda also could be at the mercy of unforeseen events., During his first stint as governor, in the 1970s and 80s, California voters passed Proposition 13, which changed the states financial structure by limiting property tax revenue, and a Mediterranean fruit fly infestation threatened the $43-billion-a-year agricultural industry., \"Ive learned that second terms can surprise,\" Brown told reporters last month. After being sworn in Monday, he will address a joint session of the Legislature., The unexpected surfaced soon after the election. The UC regents announced a plan to raise tuition up to 28% over the next five years. Preventing the increase, which they say is needed to cover retirement benefits, hire new instructors and expand enrollment, would cost $100 million in the next state budget., The outcry from students could increase pressure on Brown to boost funding more than he planned. He has said he doesnt want tuition to go up, and he notes that he gave the UC $142 million more in the current budget year than in the last., \"Hes looking at a potentially disruptive issue,\" said Barbara OConnor, professor emeritus of political communication at Cal State Sacramento, \"because students are irate, and hes concerned about legacy items like a strong education system.\", Another development, Obamas new immigration policy, could lead to a rapid expansion of the states healthcare program for the poor. Brown touts Californias laws limiting deportations and enabling people in the country illegally to have drivers licenses, but the associated costs have been relatively modest and did not hamper the governors efforts to bridle spending., That would not be the case if his administration determines it should extend Medi-Cal to immigrants protected from deportation under Obamas action. Under current law, those lacking legal residency are not eligible for Medi-Cal, which is funded by the federal and state governments., More than a million immigrants in California could remain in the country under the presidents action. But it is unclear how many might be eligible for Medi-Cal; some may have health insurance from their employers or earn too much to qualify., Because of the uncertainties, the potential cost of a Medi-Cal expansion has not been calculated, according to H.D. Palmer, spokesman for Browns Department of Finance. The administration has not \"affixed a specific number to the proposal, either in dollars or the number of individuals that may be affected,\" pending further guidance from Washington, he said., In addition, leaders of the Democrat-controlled Legislature want to raise reimbursement rates to healthcare providers in the Medi-Cal program, which could cost roughly $300 million. The issue is likely to persist as a flashpoint between Brown and members of his own party., Some Democrats have also been pressing for more social services since the economy began to recover. Now that it has rebounded, the state has the money and the obligation to help Californias most vulnerable  children living in poverty  said state Sen. Holly Mitchell (D-Los Angeles)., \"The governor cant keep singing the same song\" about belt-tightening, said Mitchell, who before being elected to the Legislature directed an organization that helped children and families. \"Weve got to address the 2 million kids who live in poverty. If we dont, they wont get out.\", Brown and the Legislature should devote more money to early childhood care and education for newborns to 5-year-olds, because \"they dont get do-overs,\" she said., Democrats are also making plans to extend the temporary tax increase voters approved in 2012, when Brown told them it would help to avoid yet another round of cuts in education funding and other needs., The governor has put a spike though the idea of extending the taxes, which are slated to begin expiring in 2016, even though legislative analysts have noted the possibility of a downturn in coming years., \"It will be tight,\" Brown said., Although deficits have faded, California is still in the grip of a drought. The recent rains and a $7.5-billion water bond approved by voters in the fall have done little to alleviate the damage sustained by farmers and water-poor towns in the states midsection, and the ultimate price tag for helping them is unclear., Browns final term may be his last chance to modernize the system that sends some Northern California water to thirsty farms and cities farther south. But his proposal to build enormous twin tunnels under the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta faces resistance., Some farmers worry that construction could damage their lands and the south could more easily help itself to delta water. Some environmentalists fear the project would further degrade the deltas ecology. The fate of the project, enabled by state lawmakers in 2009, now rests in the hands of federal and state regulators., Federal cooperation is also key to the $68-billion high-speed rail system. A groundbreaking ceremony is scheduled for Tuesday in Fresno, and billions of dollars in state and federal money have been lined up to begin construction. But finishing the rail line from Los Angeles to San Francisco is expected to require more money from Congress, where Republican leaders oppose the project., Brown has described the opposition as \"small-minded\" and has repeatedly asked Californians to trust that he has the skill to navigate the issue after many decades in public life., \"Youve got to be tough, youve got to be persistent, and I didnt get to my fourth term by being hesitant or weak-willed,\" he said the day after his reelection., He added, \"A fresh face can often be exhilarating. But theres no substitute for experience.\", Twitter: @chrismegerian, @melmason, Times staff writer Phil Willon contributed to this report.]", "Date": "20150104", "Title": "[Potential hurdles loom for Gov.

{"Content": "[[, SACRAMENTO  Its quiet at the California Capitol., While activity traditionally lags in the first few months of a legislative session, its downright sleepy at the statehouse., ------------FOR THE RECORD:  Capitol scene: On the Monday Business page of the March 2 Section A, a Capitol Business Beat column about the relative quiet in Sacramento said that revised term limits gave elected officials more time in the Legislature, up to 12 years. The law allows lawmakers to spend a maximum of 12 years in one house of the Legislature, either the Senate or the Assembly. But it also reduced from 14 years to 12 years the total combined time that can be served in both houses.   ------------, Lawmakers including scores of freshmen are still proposing plenty of bills  2,297 as of Fridays deadline for new legislation. But the usually camera-hungry politicians are holding fewer news conferences to tout proposals such as protecting consumer privacy and banning chewing tobacco at baseball games., And Gov. Jerry Brown, who was handily reelected to a fourth and final term, is spending most of his time in his office working on the agenda he set in his state of the state speech in January. The governor wants more renewable energy projects, a controversial high-speed rail line and a replumbing of water facilities to ship water from Northern to Southern California., Brown is no flashy politician. He has little taste for the Hollywood-style media events favored by his action-hero predecessor, Arnold Schwarzenegger., Veteran state politics watchers say theyre dumbfounded by the Sacramento slo-mo., The lack of electricity in the air around the Capitol is \"eerie,\" says Barbara OConnor, a professor emeritus of political science and communications at Cal State Sacramento. OConnor said she was amazed last week at the few people she saw at a restaurant popular with legislators and lobbyists. The stillness, she said, \"could be good or could be bad, nobody knows. But its not normal.\", The Capitols quiet atmosphere perhaps is the result of Browns philosophic style of governing and a certain contemplativeness that borrows from his time at a Jesuit seminary and his studies of Zen Buddhism in Japan in later years., \"The governor sets the tone in Sacramento, not the Legislature,\" said Bill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and a speech writer for Gov. Pete Wilson in the early 1990s., Brown, he said, \"spends a lot of his time off the radar screen and underground, which is not to say that hes not doing his job.\", Whats more, California now has a small budget surplus, Whalen pointed out, resulting in fewer noisy protests from teachers, nurses and other groups complaining about slashed spending., The upshot is the public and voters dont feel threatened by any huge crisis, he said. \"They dont feel like a sword of Damocles is hanging over them.\" , Democratic political strategist Darry Sragow said he senses a change in voter attitudes. Many are worried about big-picture issues, such as drought, climate change, education and jobs, and less about \"nanny\" bills that appeal to certain causes or constituent groups, he said., \"You cant push some magic button and make something happen right away,\" he said. \"They are big, complex issues and have to play out over time.\", And now that voters have revised term limits and given elected officials more time in the Legislature, up to 12 years, Sragow said. \"They are not going to be in the rush ... to make their mark in their first 20 seconds in Sacramento.\", marc.lifsher@latimes.com, Twitter: @MarcLifsher]", "Date": "20150301", "Title": "[California Legislature hits a lull]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-capitol-business-beat-20150302-story.html", "Author": "[Marc Lifsher]"}
{"Content": "[[, SACRAMENTO  Reeling from embarrassing bribery, corruption and voter fraud scandals, the state Senate took the unprecedented action Friday of voting to suspend three Democratic lawmakers from office pending the resolution of criminal charges against them., The paid suspensions of Sens. Leland Yee, Ronald S. Calderon and Roderick Wright all but guarantee Democrats will not regain their supermajority in the Senate this session. And the controversies are expected to become anti-incumbent campaign fodder in other districts in this years elections., The bipartisan 28-1 vote came two days after Yee was arrested in his hometown of San Francisco and charged by federal authorities with conspiracy to traffic in firearms without a license and accepting campaign funds in exchange for political favors., Calderon, of Montebello, was indicted last month and charged with accepting nearly $100,000 in bribes for official favors, and Wright has been convicted of lying about living in Inglewood in his Senate district. They had both previously been allowed to take voluntary leaves of absence to fight their separate criminal cases., \"I think this is a black mark on the institution,\" said Senate Republican leader Bob Huff about the spate of scandals. \"The Senate took needed and decisive action today to help restore the publics trust in this great institution.\", The Senate has never before suspended one of its members, according to Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento), who called Yees alleged actions \"sordid.\", In previous weeks, Steinberg had blocked Republican attempts to oust Calderon and Wright, but on Friday he said the allegations against Yee \"changed my point of view.\" He said having three such cases required firmer and equal action., \"An affirmative suspension puts this house on formal record that we unequivocally distance ourselves and the Senate from the unfathomable allegations contained in the Yee indictment as well as the other cases,\" Steinberg said., Steinberg has seen Wrights case as different because he says residency laws are ambiguous., But he saw more serious crimes alleged in Calderons bribery indictment and the case alleging that Yee accepted payments to help arrange an illegal arms deal and influence marijuana laws. As a result, Steinberg had called on Yee and Calderon to resign, but they refused. Gov. Jerry Brown on Friday called on all three lawmakers to resign., Steinberg could have called a vote to expel the members permanently, but he decided not to do that., \"The satisfying thing would be to expel them immediately,\" Steinberg told his colleagues. \"But I reluctantly conclude that what would be satisfying and popular would also run afoul of the most basic American principle of due process and the idea that people are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\", Sen. Joel Anderson (R-San Diego) cast the only vote against the suspensions, saying he thinks the three senators should be expelled., \"I dont believe they deserve a paid vacation,\" Anderson said., The state Constitution does not allow the Senate to withhold pay from a suspended lawmaker, so the trio will continue to draw their $95,291 annual salaries., Steinberg said he will introduce a constitutional amendment, to be put before the voters, that would allow the Senate to withhold pay when it suspends lawmakers., The Senate leader also said he would cancel a future floor session and hire trainers to spend the day meeting one-on-one with each senator and each of their staffers to review the ethics rules. He said there would be confidential conversations with each member and aide about whether they have concerns about specific actions taking place at the Capitol., \"I call on our entire body to take a deeper look at our culture,\" Steinberg told his colleagues in an impassioned speech in which he defended the Senate., Calderon declined to comment on his suspension through a spokesman, and representatives of Yee and Wright did not return calls seeking responses., Yee has been released on $500,000 bond but was not present for the Senate vote., A 137-page FBI affidavit alleges that Yee offered to help an undercover agent buy automatic weapons and to assist another undercover agent, who posed as a medical marijuana businessman, to meet influential legislators who could affect regulation of marijuana., Sen. Kevin de Len (D-Los Angeles) said the affidavit reads like a \"bad Hollywood script,\" adding: \"All of us collectively are shocked, we are dismayed by the allegations.\" But he said having criminal cases at the same time against three senators is an \"anomaly.\", Sen. Steve Knight (R-Paldmale) said that the allegations are \"embarrassing\" to the Senate, and that Wright should be expelled because a jury has found him guilty of eight felonies. \"Its never too late to do the right thing,\" he said., Yee and Calderon are prevented by term limits from running for reelection when their terms expire at the end of this year. Wrights term ends in 2016., If a judge overturns the jury verdict at a May 16 hearing, Wright could return to office. If the verdict is upheld and he resigns, a special election would be called by the governor, with mid-August being the earliest the seat could be filled, right before the end of the legislative session., The political fallout from the scandals could prevent Democrats in this years elections from regaining their two-thirds majority, which allows them to raise taxes and veto bills without Republican support. They lost it when Calderon took a leave on March 2, and are now down two votes with Yee also on suspension., Mark Baldassare, president of the Public Policy Institute of California, said hell be watching to see if the trio of scandals \"becomes an issue in those competitive seats around the state, as Democrats seek to get back their two-thirds majority in the Senate and Republicans look for ways to be competitive.\", With the controversies capturing the publics attention, \"it puts the stress on the incumbents to demonstrate to voters that they are doing the peoples business with the highest level of ethics and integrity that people expect,\" he said., patrick.mcgreevy@latimes.com, Times staff writer Melanie Mason in Sacramento contributed to this report.]", "Date": "20140328", "Title": "[In unprecedented move, state Senate votes to suspend three lawmakers]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-yee-capitol-20140329-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}

Boxer, who won the seat in 1992, announced last week that she would not seek reelection., Steyer told his online audience that he did not yet know whether he would enter the race., Question is, can I have more positive influence by running?

I think thats investing, too., Steyer is not the only would-be candidate to face criticism before announcing a decision on whether to run. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, a Democrat who is exploring a potential candidacy, was the target of multiple tweets Wednesday night from a former Los Angeles state senator, Gloria Romero., Her tweets called attention to a letter that Villaraigosa wrote on behalf of Esteban Nuez, who was sentenced to 16 years in prison for his role in the 2008 stabbing death of a San Diego college student., Nuez is the son of former state Assembly Speaker Fabian Nuez, a longtime Villaraigosa ally who used his political connections to try to keep his son out of prison. On his last night in office, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger reduced the sentence to seven years., Political favors will become election issue, Romero tweeted., When Villaraigosa first ran for mayor in 2001, rival James K. Hahn attacked him in a TV ad for writing a letter to the Clinton White House on behalf of a convicted drug trafficker. The ad, which included scenes of a crack pipe being held against a flame and a hand cutting cocaine with a razor, helped Hahn defeat Villaraigosa. Four years later, Villaraigosa unseated Hahn in a rematch., For now, state Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, a Democrat, is the only major candidate in the Senate race, but many others are considering a run.

{"Content": "[[, Secretary of State John F. Kerry, in his first remarks on the controversial prisoner swap involving American soldier Bowe Bergdahl, said if the five released Taliban leaders reenter the fight, they would risk being killed by the U.S., He spoke as reports emerged that Bergdahl, held for five years and released May 31, had been locked in a metal cage for long periods as punishment for trying to escape his captors., ------------, FOR THE RECORD, June 9, 1:54 p.m.: An earlier version of this post incorrectly identified Mike D. Rogers (R-Ala.) as the chair of the House Intelligence Committee. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) is the chair of the House Intelligence Committee. All remarks attributed to Rogers in this post were made by the Michigan congressman., ------------, His release in exchange for fiveGuantanamo Bay detainees dominated the Sunday talk shows amid reports the FBI is investigating death threats against Bergdahls family., Kerry, talking about the prospect of the former Guantanamo Bay detainees returning to the battlefield, said: Im not telling you that they dont have some ability at some point to go back and get involved, but they also have an ability to get killed doing that., He said Qatar, where the Taliban leaders will live for one year, would be monitoring the men and that the U.S. would also keep an eye on them. Nobody, no one should doubt the capacity of America to protect Americans, he added., Kerry, the top U.S. diplomat and a Vietnam veteran, was interviewed on CNNs State of the Union., Sen. John McCain, who was held captive in Vietnam for more than five years, took issue with Kerry in a separate interview on the same program by saying that 30% of the detainees released from Guantanamo Bay had reentered the fight and we certainly havent been able to kill of all them., So what were doing here is  reconstituting the Taliban government, the same guys that are mass murderers, said McCain, an Arizona Republican who was the 2008 GOP presidential nominee., McCain said he had in the past signed off on the outlines of a prisoner swap to retrieve Bergdahl, but not specifically the top five picked by the Taliban., He said those held at Guantanamo Bay were the hardest of the hard-core who became a lot harder after their years in Guantanamo. Others have raised questions about how potentially dangerous the men were., When asked whether reports that Bergdahldeserted his Army unit made him less worthy of rescue, McCain said no., But he added that the obligation to bring back captured military personnel had to be weighed against whether the effort would put the lives of other American men and women who are serving in danger., And in my view, this clearly would, he said., Republican Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, decried the prisoner swap that freed Bergdahl, saying he was absolutely convinced some or all of the freed Taliban leaders would join the fight against Americans left in Afghanistan. The released Taliban leaders now are subject to a year-long travel ban intended to prevent them from leaving Qatar., Not all five, but I do believe three for sure, likely four  will probably play some role in active operations, said Rogers, describing the fifth Taliban leader as being on the fence., Rogers, appearing on ABCs This Week With George Stephanopoulos, warned of other dire consequences. This is a huge regional and geopolitical problem for the United States moving forward, he said. Hostages are now currency in this war on terror. Thats always dangerous for both diplomats, air workers, soldiers on the battlefield., He criticized the Obama administration for not doing more to apply pressure on Pakistan to assist in winning the release of Bergdahl, who was reportedly held for a time in Pakistan., \"We never went at Pakistan with any level of pressure to say youre going to have to help us solve this problem,\" Rogers said. \"There were other options on the table.\", Top Senate Intelligence Committee officials, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said they had not been briefed by the Obama administration on Bergdahl being tortured or kept in a cage. She chairs the committee, and its top Republican lawmaker, Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Georgia, echoed on that., Both said they had heard rumors that Bergdahl had tried to flee and both had concerns about the prisoner swap and the administrations lack of openness with congressional leaders. They spoke on Face the Nation on CBS., Whats unfortunate is that I see no sign of the Taliban relenting, Feinstein said. And so some of us worry very much when we pull out (of Afghanistan) the Taliban finds its way back into power. And that would be tragic., Chambliss said that Bergdahl  who is now being treated in a military hospital in Germany  was released on a Saturday and he and Feinstein were called by the administration the following Monday night. So this administrations acted very strangely about this  and its kind of puzzling as to why they did not let us know in advance that this was going to happen., David Rohde, a Reuters reporter who while working for the New York Times was abducted more than five years ago near the Afghan capital, Kabul, said news reports about Bergdahl enduring harsh treatment sounded very credible to him as he was captured by the same Taliban faction., Rohde, also speaking on Face the Nation, escaped after being held hostage for eight months., He said Bergdahl needs to explain why he left his Army outpost, but cautioned that many rumors surrounded his own kidnapping in 2008. The journalist said he still regrets going to an interview with a Taliban official because of how his abduction affected his family., Talking about Bergdahl, Rohde noted: He will regret this for the rest of his life, I guarantee you., Rohde said he had spoken recently to Bergdahls parents, who are getting death threats and are heartbroken about whats been happening. If any U.S. troops died in the search for Bergdahl, that would break their hearts as well, he said., Also on This Week, Hillary Rodham Clinton said she would not decide whether to run for president in 2016 until the end of this year. The program previewed an interview she gave to Diane Sawyer in advance of the release of Clintons new memoir, Hard Choices, on Tuesday., Clinton said she wanted to take time to travel, sign books and help with midterm elections and then take a deep breath and weigh the pluses and minuses of a White House run., Clinton, former secretary of State, senator and first lady, left open the possibility of testifying before a new House committee gearing up for hearings on the Sept. 11, 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, that left the U.S. ambassador and three others dead.

{"Content": "[[, Seemingly every Republican who has held high office in the last two decades is eager to jump into the presidential race. Whether its the new guys, such as Sens. Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul and Govs. Chris Christie and Scott Walker, or old-timers who havent held office in years, such as Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee, Robert Ehrlich and George Pataki, Republicans are hearing the presidential bell. , Why are they all looking at 2016 longingly?, One of the major reasons is timing. The Republicans are coming off a great 2014 election, and theyre looking at an open presidential seat. Post-World War II, the two political parties have had great difficulty holding on to the presidency for more than two consecutive terms (the Ronald Reagan/George H.W. Bush administrations were the exception). The current potential candidates may believe that this is the perfect time to take a chance., The GOP also has no obvious front-runner. Since the dawn of the primary and caucus system, the Republican Party historically has looked to its second-place finishers in the last open GOP primary when a sitting Republican president is not running for reelection. Reagan, the first President Bush, Bob Dole, John McCain and Mitt Romney all got the nomination after losing in an earlier presidential run. But the second-place finisher in 2012, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, has not established a strong enough footprint in the upcoming presidential race to scare away any serious candidates., Age is a recurrent factor too. Several candidates may feel, because of their age, that this is their last opportunity for the top job. If a Republican wins in 2016, that person would presumably be seeking reelection in 2020. And, as weve repeatedly seen since the 1950s, that presidents vice president would be the most likely candidate in 2024. In the event of a 2016 Republican loss, there would be a whole new field of contenders, pushing the veteran politicians further into the past., Finally, a crucially important reason for the current rush to the stage is the change in how campaigns are financed. Previously, there was a relatively small amount of money available for presidential campaigns, and only those at the head of the field had a chance of getting any part of it. But as weve seen in recent years, money is flowing to serious  and not-so-serious  political candidates of all stripes., Media reports indicate that there was a plan to short-circuit the large list of candidates, with unnamed deep-pocketed donors coalescing early around a front-runner. The idea was that by marshaling their forces, this group would be able to anoint a candidate, and save money and political bloodshed, resulting in a stronger general election nominee. Yet weve seen the exact opposite so far., Why? The effective death of the campaign finance laws has allowed any stray billionaire to wade into the political process. This occurred in 2012, with Newt Gingrich and Santorum making serious efforts in the race thanks to heavy donations from independent backers., At the same time as the rise of the billionaires came social media and technological changes that allow candidates to amass large campaign pots from many small donors and quickly make a name for themselves among key target audiences. , For example, Barack Obamas original campaign was bolstered by the growth of social media; Christie made a national name for himself with viral clips on YouTube., The Republican presidential primary is already looking like a greatest hits version of Republican candidates from the 1990s and early 2000s, with a sprinkling of new ones thrown in. But an open presidential seat combined with easy access to money means we shouldnt expect that crowded field of candidates to thin out any time soon., Joshua Spivak is a senior fellow at the Hugh L.

{"Content": "[[, Selecting a new leader for the nations second-largest school system is a high-stakes decision for a politically divided L.A. Board of Education., The next superintendent will have to take charge of a system that has long struggled to find a unified vision to focus on improving student achievement and teacher performance, and developing a palatable plan for adapting to more technology-focused classrooms., Business and community leaders say the future of Los Angeles economy hinges on how well the district educates its 650,000 students., Interested in the stories shaping California? Sign up for the free Essential California newsletter >>, Nine months after Los Angeles Supt. John Deasy resigned under pressure, the school board is beginning its search to find his long-term replacement., After meeting late into the evening Thursday behind closed doors, the seven-member board directed staff to seek out companies qualified to conduct the search. Selecting a firm to help identify potential candidates could take until mid-September, board President Steve Zimmer said., A timeline has not been set for the lengthy search process, which includes crafting the selection criteria for the new superintendent and gathering public input. But under a scenario posed by Zimmer, the Los Angeles Unified School Districts next long-term superintendent would not start until the 2016-17 school year., That schedule raises questions about the staying power of current Supt. Ramon Cortines, who came out of retirement in October to take the reins after Deasy stepped down. The 83-year-old Cortines agreed to a contract that runs through June 2016, but has said hed prefer to leave by the end of this year., The school board has largely relied on Cortines to quietly guide the district as it decides how to move forward after Deasys high-profile tenure., The board said it was waiting for newly elected members to take office before beginning the months-long search process. Zimmer said the delay was also part of an effort to get the district back on track., \"We had to approach this from a sense of stability,\" Zimmer said., Cortines helped the district mend a malfunctioning online student records system, balance the budget and work out a contract agreement with teachers that avoided a threatened strike, Zimmer said., Board members must rally several political factions and find common ground in selecting a leader who is not only a capable administrator but whose ideology reflects their goals for the district., Zimmer said differences among board members will not hinder the search because they agree on the broader issues of providing an equitable education and improving teacher performance, even if some disagree on the approaches to reach those goals., \"Some of the ways that we might address a particular issue around a labor contract or how we might approach a particular initiative around teacher accountability may be different,\" Zimmer said. \"But there is no daylight between us in terms of the overall mission, and when you have a decision and a process that has the weight of the superintendent search, the individual conflicts and approaches will be overwhelmed by the task before us.\", Deasy had the backing of some school board members and wealthy donors who wanted to overhaul public education through a set of priorities that included supporting the growth of charter schools and using test scores as a factor in teacher evaluations., United Teachers Los Angeles, which contributed to the election campaigns of some board members, led the charge against Deasys leadership style. The union sought a different set of changes, including smaller class sizes and better teacher training., \"We do not want another person cut from the same cloth as John Deasy,\" UTLA President Alex Caputo-Pearl said. \"The next superintendent has to be collaborative and connected.\", Deasys resignation last year followed a series of missteps including a failed $1.3-billion effort to provide iPads to all students that became the target of an FBI investigation, the troubled rollout of a new records system that put students at risk of not graduating on time and frequent conflicts with school board members and the teachers union., Cortines managed to work with ideologically different sides to find compromise, said Sarah Angel, a managing director with the California Charter Schools Assn. The group expects the same type of leadership from the districts next superintendent., \"We want a superintendent who wont let politics drive decisions and policy,\" Angel said. \"We want a superintendent who will help create more high-quality options for families. We want a superintendent who believes that families have the right to choose the best learning environment for their children.\", Board member Richard Vladovic said the board feels a sense of urgency but wants to conduct an extensive search thats transparent and gives a say to parents, teachers and others who have been clamoring for a chance to help select the next leader., But Vladovic said the board also has to do some soul searching of its own., \"We need to know where were steering the ship, have a destination in mind, before we hire a captain to get us there,\" Vladovic said., zahira.torres@latimes.comTwitter: @zahiratorres, MORE ON EDUCATION:, Has LAUSDs approach to teacher discipline gone too far?, Editorial:L.A.

But Earnest said the president envisions a final trade agreement that includes enforceable labor and environmental provisions., \"The view of the president is that if the United States is not the one that is engaging in this economically dynamic region of the world, then we are essentially ceding ground to China,\" Earnest said. \"And China will most assuredly try to write rules of the road that further disadvantage American companies who are trying to do business in this region of the world.\", But Sanders said TPP would \"do nothing to encourage Nike to create one manufacturing job in this country,\" and would only boost its executives compensation., He cited a study that Nike employs more than 300,000 workers in Vietnam, where the minimum wage is just 56 cents an hour and labor unions are banned., \"If Nike can sell a pair of LeBron XII Elite iD shoes online for $320 in this country, it should be making these shoes and other products here, not in Vietnam or China.\", Acknowledging that Obama was likely to press ahead with the trip, Sanders called upon the president to raise the issue with Nike Chief Executive Phil Knight., Follow @mikememoli for more news out of Washington.]", "Date": "20150506", "Title": "[Bernie Sanders criticizes Obama's planned Nike visit to promote trade deal]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-sanders-obama-nike-20150506-story.html", "Author": "[Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, Sen. Bernie Sanders, the self-described socialist who kicked off his presidential campaign on Tuesday with a characteristically fiery speech, isnt going to win the 2016 Democratic nomination unless lightning strikes. To be really effective, in any case, the lightning would have to strike Hillary Rodham Clinton, who holds a prohibitive lead in every poll. But Sanders will still have a major impact on the Democratic race, and that could, paradoxically, be good for Clinton., The Vermont senator preaches a bracing populist message thats likely to thrill millions of voters on the left, the ones who sometimes dub themselves \"the democratic wing of the Democratic Party.\" A lot of those progressives are democratic socialists, whether they realize it or not; the only unusual thing about Sanders is that he actually uses the \"S-word.\", \"There is something profoundly wrong when the top one-tenth of 1% owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%,\" Sanders said at a raucous lakefront rally in Vermont. \"This type of rigged economy is not what America is supposed to be about.\", He said he hopes to \"begin a political revolution to transform our country economically, politically, socially and environmentally.\" And he has a detailed program to do it., Sanders wants to raise taxes on the rich not only to limit the flow of income to the upper crust but also to redistribute some of their accumulated wealth. He wants to impose a federal sales tax on stock trades and other financial transactions to pay for free tuition at every public college. He wants to open Medicare to everyone, young or old, creating a European-style single-payer healthcare system. He wants to break up big banks, clamp more regulation on Wall Street and outlaw massive donations to political campaigns., Even without a full-blown national campaign, those ideas have been enough to vault Sanders into second place in surveys of Democrats in early primary states. Well, perhaps \"vault\" is an overstatement: He draws 15% in Iowa and 18% in New Hampshire, still far behind Clintons 60% or so., Heres the key to those poll numbers: Sanders is winning almost exactly the same levels of support that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) drew in early surveys. Now that shes made it clear she isnt running, pollsters are leaving her name off, and Sanders appears to be inheriting her support., The Vermont socialist, who once chafed at comparisons with his progressive colleague, now readily embraces the role of her stand-in., \"I think our views are parallel on many, many issues,\" he told a reporter this week., So why is this challenge good for Clinton?, First, as Sanders himself acknowledges, hes \"a major underdog\"; hes not likely to win., Second, until now most of the media coverage of Clintons campaign has focused on secret emails, entanglements with uranium moguls and outlandish speaking fees. If Sanders forces a robust debate on issues such as healthcare, taxes and trade, the media will have to pay attention to that instead. Sanders entry into the race will allow Clinton, who has already veered left, to call for vaguely similar policies and still say: \"Hes a socialist; Im not.\", On a superficial level, moreover, Sanders presence on the stage will make Clinton, 67, seem relatively young. Sanders is 73; if he won the presidency, hed be 75 at his inauguration, more than five years older than Ronald Reagan in 1981., Finally, Sanders will give voters a reason to watch the Democratic debates  and maybe even get excited about the partys ideas, an emotion thats been missing until now., \"There are signs that Democratic voters are demoralized,\" Andrew Kohut, a pollster at the independent Pew Research Center, told me. \"If that persists, it can depress their turnout on election day.\", A recent Pew poll, for example, found that only 58% of Democrats said they had given a lot of thought to the presidential campaign, down from 71% eight years ago., Meanwhile, the Ipsos polling organization projected that voter turnout next year could drop to 50%, down from 55% in 2012  a trend thats especially bad for Democrats, since Republicans turn out more reliably., A Sanders campaign wont be all sweetness for Clinton, to be sure. He isnt a forgiving soul; he has already come close to calling the likely nominee a plutocrat., \"Its not just the Clintons,\" he told CNBC last week. \"When you hustle money like that  you sit in restaurants where youre spending  I dont know what they spend  hundreds of dollars for dinner and so forth. Thats the world that youre accustomed to, and thats the worldview that you adopt.\", But Clinton already knew she had that vulnerability, and so did her voters; its already reflected in her poll numbers., At this stage, Sanders cant beat Clinton; only Hillary and Bill Clinton can beat Hillary Clinton  in the form of new problems with emails or finances or other peccadilloes as yet undiscovered., doyle.mcmanus@latimes.com, Twitter: @doylemcmanus, Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinionandFacebook]", "Date": "20150527", "Title": "[Bernie Sanders: Why the guy who won't win matters]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0527-mcmanus-bernie-sanders-20150527-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, Sen. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina defense hawk, plans to enter the crowded Republican presidential primary field Monday with a campaign that probably wont deliver him to the White House, but will highlight the partys divide over national security., Graham lacks the big-money backing and name recognition thats likely to be needed to pull away from the partys increasingly unwieldy field., But for him, that may not matter., For the last several years, Graham, a former Air Force colonel and legal officer, has played a central role in a sometimes-bitter battle between the GOPs traditional defense advocates and newly emergent isolationist-leaning libertarians ledby Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is also seeking the partys presidential nomination., Graham enters the race at a time when Americans, particularly Republicans, are paying closer attention to national security concerns. As they do, Republicans are finding peril on the issue, one which they have dominated for most of the last half-century., Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, repeatedly stumbled last month over his thoughts on the war in Iraq that his brother, President George W. Bush, ordered. Other Republican hopefulshave given uneven responses about how they would manage the campaign against Islamic State militants who have seized control over large parts of Syria and Iraq., Graham will almost certainly be a constant counterpoint to Paul, who advocates a less interventionist foreign policy., The South Carolina senator did not originate the \"wacko birds\" label for Paul and his allies -- that was coined by Grahams best friend in Congress, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) -- but he might as well have., Last week Graham was caught on camera rolling his eyes as Paul objected to Senate efforts to continue the National Security Agencys once-secret collection of records of Americans telephone calls., Paul returned the favor by releasing a video denouncing the NSA program. It ridiculed both Graham and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas for their support of NSA surveillance, depicting Graham as trying to read Americans emails while sitting in a 1997-era car., In an interview during the heat of the Senate debate, Paul also accused Graham, McCain and other Republicans who support arming insurgents in Syria of having contributed to the rise of Islamic State, also referred to as ISIS., \"ISIS exists and grew stronger because of the hawks in our party, who gave arms indiscriminately, and most of those arms were snatched up by ISIS,\" he said., Graham said in an email to supporters that his \"presidential announcement will be one of the biggest and most memorable moments of my life.\", A conservative lawmaker who gained prominence among conservatives by leading House impeachment proceedings against PresidentClinton, Graham won a third term in the Senate last fall. The election had been forecast to be a difficult race, but proved to be a rout., As he approaches the militarys mandatory retirement age and eyes the White House, Graham said last week he was retiring from the Air Force after nearly 30 years. He had continued to serve as a reserve officer, at times using his skills as a military lawyer to handle legal affairs in Iraq during breaks from the Senate., A Southern Baptist and conservative on social issues, Graham, who never married, is known as a deal-maker in Congress. In 2013, he led efforts with Democrats to reform immigration laws to allow a path to citizenship for those living illegally in the U.S., Graham, 59, was born in Seneca, S.C., and lived with his family behind their liquor store, restaurant and pool hall on Main Street in Central, S.C., where he plans to announce his campaign., His personal story has helped shape his policymaking. After his parents death, he helped raise his younger sister and has championed the Social Security survivors benefits they relied upon as young people., But it is his military service and alliance with McCain that have come to define much of Grahams work in Washington as the two tried to defend hawkish foreign and defense policies against attack from some in the partys new generation.

{"Content": "[[, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida jumped into the presidential race Monday looking as a 43-year-old first-term senator might be expected to look: a bit nervous, tripping some over his words before he gained momentum. His Miami speech was earnest, his explanation of his Cuban familys immigrant story evocative., But his reach for the presidency was something more like a call for generational overthrow of the sort that has ended in presidential victories twice in the last half century, both times by Democrats., He defined Hillary Rodham Clinton, who entered the 2016 race Sunday, as \"a leader from yesterday  promising to take us back to yesterday.\", \"But yesterday is over,\" he said pointedly, almost quoting from the Fleetwood Mac lyrics  \"yesterdays gone\"  that Bill Clinton rode to victory at age 46 in 1992., He seemed to define his political mentor, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, as a beneficiary of a system disdained today by many Americans., \"In many countries the highest office in the land is reserved for the rich and powerful,\" he said in a jab at the wealthy son and brother of presidents, 19 years his senior. \"But I live in an exceptional country where even the son of a bartender and a maid can have the same dreams and the same future as those who come from power and privilege.\", Rubios retelling of his familys history, its one-generation jump from his fathers job serving drinks in a banquet hall to Rubio himself running for president, was the emotional pillar of the 2012 Republican convention, at which he spoke for nominee Mitt Romney. (His story was so moving that night in Tampa that it only underscored Romneys upbringing as a child of privilege.), His familys story worked again Monday night in Miami, both for its content and its locale: Rubio announced his presidential bid at Freedom Tower, the Ellis Island of Florida, where Cuban refugees were once processed., He echoed the inaugural address by John F. Kennedy, elected at 43, who came to the brink of nuclear war in a clash over Cuba., \"Well, now the time has come for our generation to lead the way towards a new American century,\" Rubio said, as if wrestling the torch from more senior politicians., But if Rubios rhetorical abilities are not in question, his path to the presidency certainly is, a fact demonstrated by what he chose not to talk about., He gained national notice for working with Senate Democrats to forge a comprehensive rewriting of the nations immigration laws. The measure passed the Senate but when it foundered in the House, Rubio ditched his all-in measure for the piecemeal approach advocated by harder-line Republicans. His first moves irked many conservatives; his second made erstwhile allies question his commitment. On Monday, he mentioned immigration only once, without enough specificity to upset either camp., \"If we reform our tax code, reduce regulations, control spending, modernize our immigration laws and repeal and replace Obamacare, if we do these things  the American people will create millions of better-paying modern jobs,\" he said in his sole reference to the emotional issue., The absence in his speech of more than a passing reference to Cuba spoke to a broader conflict at the heart of his candidacy. Rubio is running as the representative of a new generation, but that generation has moved toward conciliation with Cuba., Rubio, on the other hand, has been a leading opponent of President Obamas outreach to the Castro regime. So he risks looking like a man advocating generational change while continuing to embrace the Cold War  which may explain why policy toward Cuba received only a glancing mention, albeit one that drew a roar of approval from the hometown audience., \"And if America once again accepts the mantle of global leadership, by abandoning this administrations dangerous concessions to Iran and its hostility to Israel; by reversing the hollowing out of our military; by giving our men and women in uniform the resources, the care and gratitude they deserve; by no longer being passive in the face of Chinese and Russian aggression; and by ending the near total disregard for the erosion of democracy and human rights around the world, especially Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, if we did these things then our nation will be safer, the world more stable and our people more prosperous,\" he said., As the presidential race clarifies, the path seems clearer for some would-be candidates than others. Bush is looking to overwhelm his rivals in the large field and worm his way into the hearts of Republican voters with the overwhelming fundraising effort he has pressed in recent months. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is seeking the mantle of conservative chief executive who thumped a GOP enemy, organized labor. Several candidates are vying for the evangelical vote., Rubio has neither Bushs money, Walkers executive record, or  as a practicing Catholic  the loyalty of evangelical Christians who play an outsized role in the early voting, especially in the lead-off Iowa caucuses. He is giving up a safe Senate seat  one which Democrats may be able to pick up  with the audacity of youth, on a bet that his generational freshness will resonate over the long haul., \"This election is not just about what laws we will pass,\" he said. \"It is a generational choice, about what kind of country we will be.\", For political news and analysis, follow me on Twitter@cathleendecker , For other columns on politics, go to www.latimes.com/decker.]", "Date": "20150413", "Title": "[Marco Rubio enters 2016 race touting youth, avoiding messy issues]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-marco-rubio-analysis-20150413-story.html", "Author": "[Cathleen Decker]"}

He also called for congressional term limits and broad changes to the way Washington operates., I have a vision for America, he told hundreds of supporters. I want to be part of a return to prosperity  a return to a government restrained by the Constitution, a return to privacy, opportunity, liberty., Although he criticized the Obama administrations spending, he did not spare criticism of his own party., Too often when Republicans have won, we have squandered our opportunity by becoming part of the Washington machine, he said. That is not who I am., The staging of Pauls announcement reflected his effort to expand the Republican base: introducing him were former Oklahoma Rep. J.C. Watts Jr. and the Rev. Jerry Stephenson, who are both African American; Kentucky state Sen. Ralph Alvarado, a Latino; and a young University of Kentucky student, Lauren Bosler., The slogan Defeat the Washington machine; unleash the American dream adorned the lectern at which they spoke. (Pauls father, three-time presidential candidate and former Texas Rep. Ron Paul, was present but did not speak.), A series of videos accented Sen. Pauls call for reducing drug conviction penalties and his objections to collection of telephone data by the nations spy agencies  issues that he plumbed as he neared his formal announcement and returned to emphatically on Tuesday., Absent was the red meat of vital importance to the Republican base: No mention was made of President Obamas healthcare overhaul, immigration or the religious freedom debate that has galvanized conservatives in recent days., Cato Institute scholar David Boaz said that to succeed, Paul will have to draw new participants into the nominating process in big numbers, particularly in states where Republican contests are open to non-GOP voters., Hes going to get hit hard from both the left and the neocon right, and he hasnt yet played politics at this stage, so I dont know how good hell be, said Boaz, author of The Libertarian Mind. In the primary, there clearly are groups of voters who are not going to be attracted to the message that hes offering, so one of his challenges is to get some of those independents to come into open primaries and to get young people to come into open primaries and especially the Iowa caucuses., The dual effort to appeal to traditional Republicans and those not allied with the party represents Pauls greatest challenge in the primaries, and potentially his greatest strength in a general election, said Stephen Voss, a political science professor at the University of Kentucky., Hes so far from a conventional Republican, in terms of both his behavior and ideological stance, Voss said. He hopes to appeal to people who are not the standard Republican constituency, people more skeptical of military spending or projecting American muscle abroad.... That will help him appeal to a general-election audience, but in the short term, thats a challenge., The attacks have already begun. Shortly before Paul announced his intentions, a group called the Foundation for a Secure and Prosperous America launched a $1-million ad buy in the early-voting states of Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire and South Carolina that deemed Pauls foreign policy dangerous, according to the New York Times., Paul spent a substantial part of his speech defending his national security views., I envision an America with a national defense that is unparalleled, undefeatable and unencumbered by overseas nation-building, Paul said., Many political observers expect national security to be a more dominant theme in 2016 than in recent elections, due to the well-publicized brutality of Islamic State, the proposed nuclear deal with Iran, Russias behavior in Ukraine and other problems overseas. All of the other potential presidential candidates have demanded a more aggressive posture than has Paul., Clearly, many would argue that he is an isolationist, said former Rep. Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican and chairman of a group called Americans for Peace Prosperity and Security. I think his challenge is can he keep his supporters and then move to a more peace-through-strength orientation., Tuesdays speech by Paul, whose 2010 election was fueled by the rise of the tea party, received solid marks from prominent libertarians., He hit all the right notes in terms of signaling that he is serious about the libertarian dimension of his policy. I dont consider him a hard-core libertarian. I consider him libertarian-ish. He brought that to Louisville today, said Nick Gillespie, editor in chief of Reason.com., In coming days, Paul plans to barnstorm the early-contest states, with events scheduled in New Hampshire, South Carolina, Iowa and Nevada., Paul entered the race eight days after his Republican colleague, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, became the first major candidate to announce that he would seek the White House. Cruz, a tea party favorite who gained fame for a nearly 22-hour filibuster urging the defunding of President Obamas healthcare overhaul, appeals to many of the same voters who would form Pauls base., Paul and Cruz have been overshadowed during the last few months by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who has put on a fierce fundraising effort, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, whose anti-union and Midwestern sensibilities have found favor among many Republicans. Neither has formally announced, but both are expected to., Some political veterans expect Paul to make a splash in the GOP nominating contest, as his father did, but question whether voters could picture him as the leader of the free world., He does make people sit up and listen, said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist who advised Mitt Romney in 2008 and 2012. But one of the big challenges that Rand Paul will have is answering the question, Is this a candidate that I can picture in the Oval Office?, Twitter: @LATSeema, , 7:05 p.m.: This article has been updated with changes througout., 11:44 a.m.: This article has been updated with additional comments., 9:53 a.m.: This article has been updated with additional comments., 8:46 a.m.: This article has been updated throughout with additional details and background., 6:20 a.m.: This article has been updated with Rand Pauls announcement of his candidacy on his campaign website., This article was originally published at 5 a.m.]", "Date": "20150407", "Title": "[Rand Paul's 2016 entry speech makes his presidential challenges clear]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-rand-paul-presidential-campaign-2016-20150407-story.html", "Author": "[Seema Mehta]"}
{"Content": "[[, Sen. Ted Cruz jumped into the 2016 presidential race Monday in the same way he intends to run his campaign: upstaging rival Republicans with a splashy, impassioned speech that sought to drag the national conversation further to the right than many in his party want to go., The Texas senators chances of winning the White House are narrow, polls suggest. And his aggressive tactics and brash style during two years in the Senate  including nudging the GOP toward the 2013 government shutdown  have alienated many of the Republican leaders whose support he probably needs to become the nominee., But in addition to raising his political profile, Cruzs candidacy is certain to play a role in the GOP primaries as he becomes a spoiler and potential kingmaker, forcing establishment favorites  such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker  to confront tea party preferences on immigration, same-sex marriage and social welfare programs., Cruzs zeal for small government and a muscular national defense reflects the views of many Republicans. But GOP strategists acknowledge the divisive firebrand may drive the debate too far to the right for mainstream political tastes  just as many party leaders say he has done during his short time in Congress. He could force his 2016 opponents to embrace positions in the primary that they might regret when facing the Democratic nominee., Hes going to raise important questions that other candidates are going to have to answer, especially on social issues, said Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles. Are you pro-life? Pro-marriage? Ted Cruz has been very bold and he sort of puts pressure on people like Jeb and Rand [Paul] to speak about the issues., But Aguilar warned that Cruzs stances, such as his opposition to President Obamas program to defer deportation for millions of immigrants in the U.S. illegally, could alienate voters in the general election if embraced by other candidates., Cruz, the son of a Cuban immigrant, makes no apologies for his goal to shake up the mainstream. He has said repeatedly that he wants to be seen as the disruptive app of GOP politics., It is the time for truth, Cruz told an enthusiastic crowd of Liberty University students Monday. It is the time for liberty. It is the time to reclaim the Constitution of the United States., It was no accident that he chose to launch his presidential bid at the religious campus founded by the late pastor Jerry Falwell. Not far from the historic Civil War site of Appomattox, Liberty University has been a popular destination for Republicans seeking to bolster their conservative credentials. It also boasts an alumni and donor network that extends far from the campus, nestled near the scenic Blue Ridge Mountains., Cruz appeared onstage in a massive sports arena amid waving American flags and Christian rock music. He emphasized his familys personal struggles and Christian faith, calling on courageous conservatives to join him as he seeks to ignite the same grass-roots movement that propelled him to the Senate in 2012., The answer will not come from Washington, he said. It will come only from men and women across this country, the people of faith, the lovers of liberty., Student attendance was mandatory. The young audience appeared receptive to his repeated calls to imagine a president who would repeal the healthcare law, reverse Obamas recent immigration actions, shutter the Internal Revenue Service and champion a small-government, socially conservative agenda. When he finished, he was joined onstage by his wife, Heidi, and their two young daughters., Crucial to his underdog campaign will be Cruzs ability to court and energize this new generation of young evangelicals and social conservatives, not unlike what former Sen. Barack Obama did with young progressives in 2008., Tapping into millennial culture, Cruz tweeted his announcement early Monday, then asked the students in the arena to send text messages to his campaign  a strategy for building a database of potential supporters that was also reminiscent of Obamas tech-savvy presidential run. Many students obliged., Seeing the values he has, for his country, his family, hes a great candidate, said Justin Taubensee, 18, who said he was seriously considering casting his first presidential primary vote for the senator., Whether that message resonates with all Americans has yet to be seen. The Texas senator trails Bush and Walker in the most recent CNN poll., Cruz becomes the first major candidate to declare his candidacy for 2016. His strategists hope the head start will provide an edge in garnering media attention and donations., This is a chance to consolidate the conservative movement, said one senior advisor, who requested anonymity to discuss the campaign, which decided to forgo the traditional exploratory committee and jump straight into the race., Cruz expects to announce he will have more than $1 million on hand by the end of the month, and plans to raise $40 million to $50 million for the primary campaign., He headed to New York later Monday, with a return trip planned at the end of the week to New Hampshire, which holds the nations first primary., Cruz faces risks in launching a White House bid just two years after winning his first elective office. Presidential campaigns rarely leave candidates unscathed, and a poor showing could damage his brand. Previous GOP aspirants like former Texas Gov. Rick Perry in 2012 learned that high-profile stumbles on the national stage can damage careers., This is the thing all candidates risk: rejection, said David Winston, a veteran Republican pollster and strategist unaffiliated with any of the potential candidates., Cruz is perhaps best known for his fight against the Affordable Care Act, which led to the 2013 federal government shutdown and boosted him as a conservative favorite. That renegade approach excites the partys most ardent activists, but it has increasingly pained Republican Party leaders and turned Cruz into an outsider on Capitol Hill., The shutdown hurt the Republican Partys image overall but helped Cruz, at least among his core supporters. A Pew Research Center survey showed his standing soared at the time among Republicans who identified with the tea party. At the same time, public approval ratings for the GOP sank to new lows., Democrats portray Cruz as an extremist., As the de facto leader of the Republican Party in recent years, it is only fitting that Ted Cruz would position himself in front of the GOPs 2016 presidential field, said Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. His reckless approach to governing would make life worse, not better, for Americans, and he isnt the type of fighter that Americas middle-class families need., As a freshman senator and tea party favorite, the Harvard-educated Cruz, 44, pulled off a stunning victory in 2012 when he toppled an establishment-backed Republican to win the party nomination for the Senate seat from Texas., Because he was born in Canada to an American mother, questions have been raised on whether Cruz is eligible for the presidency. Cruz has argued that he fulfills the requirement because his mother was a U.S. citizen. The Constitution requires the president to be a natural born citizen, but courts have never clarified what that means., Cruzs advisors envision a path to the presidential nomination that continues to draw tea party voters who backed his first campaign while peeling away libertarian support from another tea party favorite, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and attracting evangelical conservatives from more overtly religious candidates., Such a coalition could form the foundation of what Cruzs team hopes will put him in second place during the primaries  poised to confront the establishment-backed front-runner, whether Bush or Walker., With Paul expected to announce his run soon, perhaps in early April, Cruzs advisors acknowledge that they have work to do introducing their candidate to a broader audience. But for the next few days at least, Cruz appears to have the stage he wants  to himself., lisa.mascaro@latimes.com, , 7:21 p.m.: The story was updated throughout with new details., 3:26 p.m.: The story was updated with more analysis and reaction, 9:10 a.m.: The story was updated to include quotes from Cruzs speech., The story was first published at 8:36 a.m.]", "Date": "20150323", "Title": "[Ted Cruz's entry into 2016 race puts pressure on Republicans]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-cruz-announcement-20150323-story.html", "Author": "[Lisa Mascaro]"}
{"Content": "[[, Sen. Ted Cruz stood outside the Capitol on a dreary Wednesday, leading the charge against President Obamas immigration plan. But it was not entirely clear who was following him., The Texas Republican was imploring fellow GOP members to block money for Obamas immigration action as part of the upcoming legislative battle to fund the government by the Dec. 11 deadline or risk a federal shutdown., \"What Im urging my fellow Republicans to do is very, very simple,\" Cruz said, his speech punctuated by cheers from the modest crowd, including a man dressed in a Revolutionary period patriot outfit., \"We will fund the operation of the federal government, but we will not allocate taxpayer dollars for lawless and illegal amnesty.\", Last year, the Texas senators ability to influence core conservatives drew jokes that hed become \"Speaker Cruz,\" rivaling the power of actual House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio)., The Cruz strategy of using the annual spending bill as leverage to fight Obama over the Affordable Care Act had largely been blamed for the politically unpopular 2013 government shutdown., Fresh from that episode, the Cruz clout began to dim., Now, the potential 2016 presidential hopeful is advocating a similar hardline approach against the presidents executive action on immigration, which would protect up to 5 million immigrants -- largely parents of U.S. citizens -- from deportation., Cruz wants to fund most of the government by the deadline, but withhold any money that could be used by the Department of Homeland Security to implement Obamas immigration plan., On the grassy east front of the Capitol, he was joined by a small group of GOP lawmakers well-known for their hard stances against illegal immigration -- Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, Rep. Steve King of Iowa and Rep. Tim Huelskamp of Kansas. One enthusiast in the crowd cheered \"Cruz 2016!\", But it appeared support for the Cruz strategy may not be enough to derail Boehners more tempered approach., The speakers leadership team was trying to round up votes Wednesday for legislation to fund the government through the fiscal year ending in September, but only provide temporary funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which handles the immigration agencies. Once the DHS funding runs out early next year, Republicans could revisit the immigration issue after the GOP majority is seated in January., Led by Boehner, the House Republican leaders are also offering a parallel bill that would simply oppose Obamas actions. That legislation would be largely symbolic, since Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), the majority leader, has said he would not bring it forward in the Senate. But it could allow opponents of the president an opportunity to register their displeasure with his immigration plan., Cruz mocked such \"show-votes\" as ineffective. He suggested that many Republicans won re-election to Congress last month vowing to prevent Obamas immigration action, and now they need to keep their promises., For the latest from Congress follow @LisaMascaro]", "Date": "20141203", "Title": "[Sen.

{"Content": "[[, Senate Democrats have dropped a key demand that led them to filibuster President Obamas request for expedited consideration of a major trade deal, quickly resolving a rare internal battle between the president and his party., The decision makes it more likely that the Senate will pass legislation that gives Obama the authority he said he needs to help complete negotiations with 11 Pacific Rim nations over the free trade agreement., On Tuesday, a group of lawmakers opposed to the trade agreement persuaded most of their fellow Democrats to join them in blocking a vote on the presidents request., The Democrats blocking of Obamas priority magnified the difficulty that the president has had in persuading his allies to support the trade agreement, which he calls the most progressive such deal in American history. Key Democratic constituencies, though, fear the pact could hurt American manufacturing., The deal is one of Obamas top remaining legislative concerns, requiring a sustained lobbying campaign that included last weeks visit to Nikes headquarters to highlight potential benefits to the U.S. economy of increased exports and lower tariffs on goods produced by American companies., He also met Tuesday after the filibuster with a group of 10 pro-trade Democrats at the White House to discuss the path forward. As a result of that and other negotiations, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the Senate will again attempt to vote on the trade measure in coming days., Democrats, led by Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Senate Democrat, had pushed to use the trade authority bill as leverage to force a vote on a measure penalizing countries that manipulate their currency., Schumer has long accused China of deliberately devaluing its currency to gain an unfair advantage in trade, and more recently critics have complained about Japan using its depreciated yen to do the same., China isnt part of the trade negotiations, but Japan is, and American car manufacturers, labor unions and some others want the pact to include sanctions for countries found to be manipulating their currencies., The Obama administration has refused to seek tough currency provisions in trade negotiations, saying it would kill the deal, and Obama is likely to veto such legislation if it should clear both chambers and reach his desk., Though Democrats dropped the demand to package the currency bill with the measure to give Obama negotiating power on trade, a leadership aide said that if it were to pass the Senate, the House could still link the two., McConnell called it a reasonable solution that would guarantee Democrats had up-or-down votes on the currency bill in a way that \"will not imperil the increased American exports and American trade jobs we need., Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) also called it a fair outcome., This is a complex issue, one that deserves a full and robust debate, he said., The White House continued Wednesday to insist that Tuesdays failed vote was only a procedural snafu, and expressed optimism that the legislation would move forward on a second attempt., Press Secretary Josh Earnest also downplayed an increasingly personal battle between Obama and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a top critic of the proposed trade deal, while acknowledging the robust debate., The president and Sen. Warren both believe that its important for our government to be putting in place policies that will expand economic opportunity for middle-class families, he said.

{"Content": "[[, Senate leaders moved toward a deal Wednesday to avoid a shutdown of the Homeland Security Department, sidestepping a fight over immigration policy, as President Obama declared his administration would curtail deportations of immigrants in the country illegally despite losing a court fight on the issue this month., Money for the Homeland Security Department has been tied up for weeks as congressional conservatives sought to block the departments budget unless Democrats agreed to a measure repealing Obamas executive actions on deportation., Funds for the department, which oversees immigration and border security, among other duties, will run out Friday night unless lawmakers act. Administration officials say that would force some department employees off the job, while about 85% of the departments more than 200,000 front-line employees would have to work without pay., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has been anxious to avoid even a temporary shutdown of the department, fearing the political risk. On Tuesday, he offered to move ahead with a no-strings-attached bill to provide funds, and on Wednesday, Senate Democrats agreed not to block his plan., Meanwhile, in a meeting with activists in Washington and later in a town hall event in Miami hosted by Telemundo, Obama defended his plan to stop the deportation of several million immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally. The executive action he took was necessary to encourage a large population to come out of the shadows, work and pay taxes, he said., He tried to calm worries about the legal difficulties his plan has encountered, saying at the town hall event that a decision this month by a federal judge in Texas to block implementation of his plan was just one federal judge., His administration has appealed the decision aggressively, Obama said, adding that the legal fight wont slow down the administrations decision to shift the focus of deportations from families to people with criminal records., You are going to see a substantial change even as the case makes its way through the courts, Obama told the group., Obamas trip was the latest sign of the presidents hope to begin shaping the issues of the 2016 presidential race. Democrats hope that a large Latino turnout in their favor, like the ones they enjoyed in 2008 and 2012, will help them again. The immigration issue is key to that., The standoff over the Homeland Security budget has helped heighten the contrast between the two parties on immigration issues, much to the chagrin of some Republican strategists., To end the deadlock, McConnell proposed that the Senate vote to provide money for the department and act separately to overturn Obamas policy., Even if both houses passed a repeal measure, however, Obama could veto it, which the president made clear he would do., If McConnell and House Speaker John A.Boehner want to have a vote on whether what Im doing is legal or not, they can have that vote, he said. I will veto that., Senate Democrats, meeting privately over lunch, decided they would not block McConnells offer of an unencumbered funding bill for the department. They also said they would block the vote on Obamas immigration policy until funds for Homeland Security had been approved by both chambers, ending the shutdown threat., Early Wednesday afternoon, an initial procedural vote to open debate on the money bill passed the Senate, 98 to 2, with the opposition coming from conservative Republicans., This isnt a time for games, said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.)., Progress in the Senate, though, still means days of knotty procedural votes unless all senators agree to speed up the process. That seems unlikely because several conservative Republicans who are most opposed to the presidents immigration actions would prefer to prolong the fight., \"Its going to be bumpy,\" said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the chambers second-ranking Republican., McConnell said he would \"work to expedite\" the process, with the goal being Senate passage \"this week.\" Senate officials, however, said that unless conservatives drop their objections, the earliest the chamber could finish the bill would be Sunday., Were beginning a pathway here, a process, said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), the minority whip. Were testing the waters of trust., Even if the Senate is able to wrap up its work, there would still be a question of whether Boehnerwould be willing to bring such a bill to the floor of his chamber, where it could pass with Democratic support. Doing so would deeply anger some Republican conservatives., A group of 30 House Republicans wrote to the GOP leadership Wednesday urging them to hold firm against the McConnell plan., We want to stop the amnesty, said Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.), who believes linking the immigration fight to the money bill provides Republicans with leverage., Most Americans would not notice a difference in their lives if Homeland Security funds run out, he said., Boehner did not commit himself in comments to reporters Wednesday morning., Im waiting for the Senate to act, he said as he emerged from a closed session of House Republicans before holding his first talks with McConnell in two weeks. Until the Senate does something, were in wait-and-see mode., House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) told fellow lawmakers to keep their schedules flexible, a hint that Congress may need to work over the weekend to resolve the standoff or to pass a stop-gap measure to keep the department operating for a few extra days., Florida illustrates the stakes for both parties with Latino voters., Nationwide, Latinos voted for Obama over Republican Mitt Romney in 2012 by almost 3 to 1, according to exit polls, in an election in which Latino voters made up a tenth of the electorate. Obama carried Florida, a key swing state, in both of his elections, largely because of strong margins among Latinos, who make up almost 1 in 5 of the states voters., At the same time, the state has one Republican senator, a Republican governor and Republican majorities in the Legislature, showing that Democrats are far from dominant. The next Democratic nominees prospects in Florida would be further complicated if former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush wins the Republican nod., Obama made it clear what he wants the litmus test to be., When people come asking for votes, Obama said, \"the first question should be, do you really intend to deport 11 million people? If not, what is your plan?\", But Obama and his partys hopes to win Latino votes wont be quite that simple, said Eduardo Gamarra, a professor of politics and international studies at Florida International University, where Wednesdays town hall event took place., Democrats will also need to make a case to a narrower audience that is divided over Obamas Cuba policy, he said., Obama announced in December that he would begin taking steps to restore diplomatic ties with Cuba and gradually bring an end to a five-decade standoff with the communist nation., Young Cuban Americans in and around Miami, home to a large Cuban community, are more open to the presidents strategy than are their parents and grandparents, Gamarra said, citing repeated polls conducted by the university., The president encountered signs of that challenge almost immediately upon arriving Wednesday. Driving from the airport, his motorcade passed a cluster of protesters and a man waving a sign: \"Freedom for Cuba. Helping Castro is a crime.\", For more on the White House, follow@CParsons on Twitter.

{"Content": "[[, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is not one to run from a fight., The tenacious Nevadan pulled himself from dusty, desert poverty to the corridors of power, and once punched his future father-in-law after being denied a date with the woman who would become his bride., Taming that battle instinct and returning to his roots as a shrewd deal-maker is the challenge facing the Democrat as he finds himself leading a disheartened minority party whose senators are clamoring for change after the Republican electoral sweep., Will the former amateur boxer, who is often singularly blamed for recent congressional gridlock, be able to partner with incoming Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John A. Boehner as they take control of a new Republican-led Congress? Or will he resort to the very obstinacy he has derided in Republicans over the last six years in order to protect Democratic priorities?, \"I think hes open to a new approach,\" said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), the No. 2 Democrat., Ever since President Obama was elected, the Senate under Reids leadership has provided both the muscle for the administrations initiatives and, later, the safety net for blocking House GOP attempts to repeal Obamacare, slash budgets and undo environmental and immigration actions., Reid will remain crucial on both fronts. Despite Republican post-election gloats about \"firing Harry Reid,\" the lawmaker retains a powerful ability to either gum up the Senate or let legislation flow. Because the new GOP Senate majority is narrow, McConnell will need Reids support to reach the 60-vote threshold required to overcome filibusters of Senate bills., \"Clearly, hes going to have some power,\" Boehner conceded Thursday., Reid will also have to decide how far to go in protecting the presidents policies. After this weeks electoral losses, many Democrats blamed Obamas unpopularity and complained about Reids past insistence on providing political cover for the White House and senators facing tough reelections. That usually meant using his position to block Republican amendments on healthcare or energy, and keeping politically charged GOP bills from reaching the Senate floor., As Reid considers his own future  he turns 75 this year  hell need to balance whats good for Obama with whats good for Senate Democrats and for the partys 2016 presidential nominee  and, of course, whats good for Reid., \"There may be more synergy between the president and congressional Republican leaders because Obama wants to build a legacy and Republicans want to prove theyre the gang that can shoot straight, and its unclear right now how Democrats feel about that,\" said Jim Kessler, senior vice president at Third Way, a moderate Democratic think tank., Reid has signaled hes not going anywhere. He fully expects to run for reelection in 2016  and to take back the Senate at the same time, thanks to a favorable electoral map in which many vulnerable Republicans will face reelection. Senate Democrats who are next in line for Reids job all pledged their support this week for him to serve another term as their leader., Reid, no stranger to serving in the minority, must decide whether to filibuster the GOP agenda and deny McConnell credit for breaking congressional deadlock, or allow some measures to pass in a nod toward bipartisanship and to prevent Democrats from being painted as the new obstructionists., \"If given half a chance to compromise, Sen. Reid will be more than willing to do so,\" said Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist and former senior aide to both Reid and the late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy. \"But its hard to imagine hes going to be given much of a chance. If you think that the takeaway [from the election] is that the House Republican conference will compromise more, you need to get your head examined.\", Likely, Reid will take a case-by-case approach, hoping that Republicans will prove unable to overcome their own internal party divisions to agree on legislative proposals or that there will be no public appetite for what the GOP is offering., \"If past is prologue, in the past, Sen. Reid gave Republicans just enough rope to hang themselves, and they did,\" Kessler said. \"That might be his plan.  There will be no freebies for Republicans. Everything they want is going to come with a price.\", Republican measures to curb environmental regulations or tighten welfare rules, for example, could find some Democratic support. Fast-tracking trade negotiations and doling out corporate tax breaks will require some concessions to Democrats. Repealing the Affordable Care Act is a nonstarter., Reid will have to navigate some of his own partys divisions as well. Post-election soul-searching is putting a spotlight on splinters between the partys liberal wing and its moderates. Theres a growing sentiment among rank-and-file senators that Reid should loosen his grip and allow them to vote their conscience without retribution  even on Republican proposals that may be politically painful for some Democrats., \"Harry has operated like a doting father over adolescent children,\" said Sen.

{"Content": "[[, Setting up another veto showdown with President Obama, Congress on Thursday approved a measure that seeks to roll back a new labor rule that allows workers to conduct union elections more quickly., Labor organizers and Democrats said the rule was needed to prevent employers from using delay tactics to block union votes, but Republicans said it would clear the path for \"ambush elections\" in which companies would not have enough time to present an opposing point of view., The resolution had been a priority among business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce., The House approved the resolution, 232 to 186, on a largely party-line vote, with three Republicans from Northeastern states siding with Democrats to oppose it. The Senate had passed the measure on a similarly partisan vote, 53 to 46, this month., Those numbers fall short of the two-thirds needed to override a White House veto. It would mark Obamas second veto this year and fourth since he took office., \"Instead of seeking to undermine a streamlined democratic process for American workers to vote on whether or not they want to be represented, the Congress should join the president in strengthening protections for American workers and giving them more of a voice in the workplace and the economy,\" the White House said., Organized labor has been fighting for years to speed the process for conducting union elections, arguing that the delays can give employers an advantage and dissuade workers who face potential harassment., But Republicans in Congress have repeatedly halted efforts to change the rules. Late last year, the National Labor Relations Board stepped in with a rule to expedite workplace elections, shortening the process to as little as eight days., The new rule, which goes into effect April 14, also limits the time for reviews and appeals and makes it easier for union organizers to file election paperwork electronically, rather than by mail or messenger. The rule also gives unions access to employee phone numbers and addresses so they can contact workers after hours., Republicans vowed to roll back the new rule when they took control of Congress this year., \"Joining a union is a big choice,\" said Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) on the House floor Thursday. \"But to make an informed decision, workers need time to decide whats best for them and their family, and they shouldnt be pressured or rushed.\", McCarthy said \"ambush elections\" only serve to \"bully workers to accepting unionization as fast as possible. Thats not pro-worker. Thats pro-union, and theres a big difference.\", To block the rule, Congress relied on a little-used authority that allows the House and the Senate to block a federal agency from implementing a rule by issuing a joint resolution of disapproval., Union officials said it is unlikely elections would be as swift as eight days, but they argued the changes were needed to give workers an even playing field to organize. They welcomed the presidents veto threat., \"President Obama is right in his commitment to vetoing this harmful legislation,\" said AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka. \"Congressional Republicans should focus their efforts on lifting workers up instead of shutting them out.\", Forcing the president into issuing vetoes has been central strategy of the new Congress, which is under Republican control for the first time in eight years., Even though Republicans may not have enough votes in the House and the Senate to override Obamas vetoes, GOP leaders believe such showdowns will amplify the ideological difference between the parties., Obamas first substantial veto of his presidency was last month when Republicans  with the help of Democratic votes  approved legislation expediting the Keystone XL pipeline., lisa.mascaro@latimes.com]", "Date": "20150319", "Title": "[Congress sets up veto showdown with vote to roll back labor rule]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-labor-rule-congress-20150320-story.html", "Author": "[Lisa Mascaro]"}
{"Content": "[[, Shavar Jeffries, the new president of Democrats for Education Reform, used a hotel in Los Angeles this week to explain how school choice could work., He arrived here Tuesday night, one of his first stops on a tour of the groups 14 state affiliates. The place was a \"dump,\" so he checked into the Omni in downtown Los Angeles., The ability to choose a new hotel, Jeffries says, is a privilege  as is the ability for parents to choose a new school when they believe theyre in the educational equivalent of a hotel in squalor. Similarly, just like hotels, schools should work to keep their clientele, he said., \"I know its not the best metaphor, but I believe school choice is the same thing,\" Jeffries said, speaking from a couch in the Omnis glossy lobby. \"You should have to work hard for babies. You should be changing babies lives.\", Thats how Jeffries describes the need for alternatives to low-performing public schools, such as charter schools, which are publicly funded but can be privately run. Enrollment at independent charter schools in Los Angeles has grown dramatically from 60,643 in the 2009-10 school year to 101,060 in 2015-16, and philanthropists have embarked on a new effort to accelerate their growth., Jeffries is taking the helm of Democrats for Education Reform, a politically influential group that has emerged as a counter to teacher unions, a historical stalwart of the Democratic Party. The groups California affiliate has sparred with the party. DFER has backed many successful candidates who have boosted the groups agenda, which includes expanding charter schools and evaluating teachers in a tougher way., Mayors from Los Angeles to New York have embraced the groups priorities, but recent occurrences show that the pendulum is moving: In New York, much of Mayor Bill de Blasios campaign hinged on bashing former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg  an education reform philanthropist  for his schools agenda. In Los Angeles, after the tenure of Supt. John Deasy, much of current Supt. Ramon Cortines rhetoric has focused on repairing the district and rebuilding trust with the community., So far, on the 2016 presidential campaign trail, Democratic candidates have steered away from discussing K-12 education, which can be divisive. Instead, they have focused on the softer issues of preschool and higher education., In tapping Jeffries, reform advocates sought a fresh voice, one that is more in sync with the children it aims to uplift. Jeffries is black, raised by his grandmother in Newark, N.J., after his mother was murdered. After attending Newark public schools, he went to a private, preparatory school on a scholarship, and then Duke University, Columbia Law School and a series of prestigious law firms., Jeffries said he is ready to jump back into the fray. Schools that dont serve parents well, Jeffries said, dont deserve to be in business. The process of creating better options, though, is \"going to be painful,\" he said. And he would know., He was talking about the pain communities feel when low-performing schools are shuttered and teachers lose their jobs to make way for charter schools. But he too has scars from that process. Jeffries is a civil rights attorney who lost the 2014 race to become Newarks mayor to Ras Baraka, a critic of reform policies. Baraka won with the support of unions, which ran ads such as: \"Theyre coming. From Wall Street. From Trenton. To sell us Shavar Jeffries.\", As a result, he is aware of the mistakes his own movement has made. Distrust crops up, he said, \"when you have a bunch of white folks who arent in these communities who are disconnected, coming in, out of the blue, announcing what theyre going to do, and then just starting to do it.\" Approaches like this, in addition to a lack of diversity, he said, have caused \"unforced errors.\", As Jeffries continues fighting for DFERs priorities, the unions are ready to swing back. In response to his appointment, American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten released a statement that called out \"East Coast DFERs\" for promoting \"ideological policies\" that \"have not helped all kids succeed.\", Jeffries succeeds Joe Williams, who guided the organization through the election of Barack Obama and his appointment of Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. Williams left DFER this summer to do political work related to education for members of the Walton family, which controls Wal-Mart., DFER board member Mary L. Landrieu, a former U.S. senator from Louisiana, recently met Jeffries at a fundraiser at political consultant James Carvilles house. \"As an African American leader, he brings a very authentic voice to this debate,\" she said. \"Its clear that the passion he has for equity isnt something he read in a book somewhere.

{"Content": "[[, Six months ago, President Obamas foreign policy looked stymied. Negotiations with Israel and the Palestinians were at a dead end. Russia was gaining ground in eastern Ukraine. U.S. efforts to end the war in Syria were ineffective. A new extremist army, Islamic State, was marching into Iraq., As misfortunes gathered, Obamas response was defensive  and earthy. His first principle, he said, was Dont do stupid shit. , But as strategy, that was so inadequate that it drew a public rebuke from his former secretary of State. Great nations need organizing principles, and Dont do stupid stuff is not an organizing principle, Hillary Clinton told an interviewer., Today the picture looks different., Last week, Obama surprised the world by normalizing U.S. relations with Cuba after a half-century freeze. Before that, he struck significant deals with China on climate change and trade. He launched a new war in Iraq, the country from which he had long promised to extricate the United States. And in a little-noted but important move, he extended a limited U.S. combat role in Afghanistan for at least another year, stretching his 2014 deadline for a pullout., Only recently criticized as passive, Obama suddenly looks hyperactive., And theres more to come. Obama still hopes to conclude a nuclear deal with Iran, a diplomatic achievement that will produce major controversy. He plans to lift as many economic sanctions on Cuba as Congress will allow. And aides say they will consider yet another attempt at Middle East peace talks if Israels March election produces a receptive government., What happened?, My presidencys entering its fourth quarter, Obama said at his news conference on Friday. Interesting stuff happens in the fourth quarter., Has he undergone a conversion from a president bent on minimizing foreign entanglements to one whos actively seeking opportunities for diplomatic boldness? Is he admitting he was aiming too low and risking too little? , Not really. Obamas foreign policy was never quite as passive as its critics made it out to be  and today, its not quite as brilliant and visionary as administration officials try to make it sound., What were seeing, instead, is how circumstance, luck, plus a measure of diplomatic skill, can bring about a run of better-than-average results., Some of it is the slow ripening of efforts launched long ago. The talks with Cuba took 18 months, plus a push from Pope Francis. The climate deal with China was more than a year in the making. The nuclear talks with Iran have been under way even longer., U.S. diplomacy has benefited from one huge piece of luck: the increase in North American oil production and the drop in world oil prices. That has made the U.S. and its allies less vulnerable economically and has reduced the running room of adversaries such as Russia and Iran. , The 2014 congressional election played a part, too. The fact that Obama has survived his last campaign has freed him to use his foreign policy powers more freely  as he did in normalizing relations with Havana. A Republican-controlled Senate wont make his life easy, but he no longer needs to worry as much about the electoral impact on Democrats if, for example, he concludes a nuclear deal with Iran., And part of Obamas recent activism hasnt, strictly speaking, been at his own initiative; hes been forced to react to unwanted events, including Russias invasion of Ukraine and the rise of Islamic State. In Afghanistan, he agreed to continue U.S. combat support for the Afghan armed forces after U.S. military officials warned that without American help, Kabuls forces could quickly crumble., In the end, the pillars of Obamas foreign policy havent changed. Hes still avoiding most invitations to employ U.S. military power in foreign conflicts; theres no appetite for getting more directly involved in Syria or for supplying weapons to Ukraine. Hes still persuaded that diplomatic engagement is most likely to bear fruit with adversaries  hence the talks with Cuba and the widening of discussions with Iran to include the future of Syria and Iraq., And even though he has revived the Clinton-era slogan of the U.S. as the indispensable nation, Obama is still trying to adjust the goals and means of U.S. diplomacy to a world in which the United States has less absolute power, less money and less appetite for military adventures., And his administration is still capable of diplomatic missteps. David Rothkopf, a former Clinton administration official and author of National Insecurity: American Leadership in an Age of Fear, wrote recently: It is hard to think of a recent president who has grown so little in office., I asked Rothkopf last week whether the administrations recent successes had caused him to revise his assessment. Not yet, he said., Obamas fourth-quarter foreign policy looks better than it did six months ago.

{"Content": "[[, Six prisoners held for 12 years at Guantanamo Bay have been sent to Uruguay to be resettled as refugees, the U.S. government announced Sunday  a deal that had been delayed for months by security concerns in the Pentagon and political considerations in the South American country. , The six men  four Syrians, a Tunisian and a Palestinian  are the first prisoners transferred to South America from the U.S. base in Cuba, part of a flurry of recent releases amid a renewed push by President Barack Obama to close the prison. , All were detained as suspected militants with ties to Al Qaeda in 2002 but were never charged. They had been cleared for release since at least 2010 but they could not be sent home and languished as the U.S. struggled to find countries willing to take them. , Uruguayan President Jose Mujica agreed to accept the men as a humanitarian gesture and said they would be given help getting established in a country with a small Muslim population. , Among those transferred is 43-year-old Syrian Abu Wael Dhiab, who was on a long-term hunger strike at Guantanamo to protest his confinement. He was at the center of a legal battle in U.S. courts over the militarys force-feeding of prisoners who refuse to eat. , We are very grateful to Uruguay for this important humanitarian action, and to President Mujica for his strong leadership in providing a home for individuals who cannot return to their own countries, U.S. State Department envoy Clifford Sloan said. , The other Syrians sent to Uruguay on Saturday were identified by the Pentagon as Ali Husain Shaaban, 32; Ahmed Adnan Ajuri, 37; and Abdelahdi Faraj, 39. Also released were Palestinian prisoner Mohammed Abdullah Taha Mattan, 35, and 49-year-old Adel bin Muhammad El Ouerghi of Tunisia. , The mens release brings the total number of prisoners at Guantanamo to 136  the lowest number since the first month the prison opened in January 2002. , Mujica had agreed to take the men in January. Obama administration officials, frustrated that the transfer took so long, blamed outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel for not approving the move sooner. They said the deal sat for months on Hagels desk, awaiting his signature as required by law, but the Pentagon didnt send the notification of the transfer to Congress until July. , By then, the transfer had become an issue in Uruguays political election and officials there decided to postpone it until after the vote. Tabare Vazquez, a member of Mujicas ruling coalition and a former president, won a runoff election on Nov. 30. , Obama had pledged to close the prison upon taking office but was blocked by Congress, which banned sending prisoners to the U.S. for any reason, including trial, and placed restrictions on sending them abroad. , The slow pace of releases has created a tense atmosphere inside the prison. A hunger strike that began in February 2013 totaled about 100 prisoners at its peak, including Dhiab and Faraj. , The restrictions on sending them overseas have been eased and the U.S. has released 19 prisoners so far this year. Officials say several more are expected by the end of the year. , Prisoners have been sent around the world but this weekends transfer was the largest group sent to the Western Hemisphere. Four Guantanamo prisoners were sent to Bermuda in 2009.

{"Content": "[[, Sketching the broad outlines of a presidential campaign that is undeclared but well underway, Jeb Bush on Friday mixed familiar calls for lower taxes and less regulation with an admonishment to fellow Republicans to stay upbeat and offer hope as their central message in 2016., \"Just a lot of reasons to be angry or grumpy and negative and then react to the overreach,\" the former Florida governor told a gathering of the nations auto dealers in San Francisco after delivering a long and scathing assessment of President Obamas time in office, both domestically and on the world stage., But, he went on, \"were not going to win votes as Republicans unless we can lay out a hopeful, optimistic message thats based in reality, thats grounded in a set of policies that are real, that people believe can actually happen. Hope and a positive agenda wins out over anger and reaction every day of the week.\", Bushs appearance before an overflow audience of several thousand was his first campaign-style stop since announcing last month via social media that he was actively exploring a run for the office held by his father and his older brother., Seeming relaxed in the friendly setting of a strongly pro-business crowd, Bush spent half an hour offering his vision of a future America renewed by a lighter governing hand in Washington, a dramatic overhaul of the education system and a more muscular foreign policy., He was unsparing in his criticism of Obama, suggesting at one point that the presidents desire to pull back from military engagement abroad had resulted in the renewed rise of terrorism and the threat of another Sept. 11-style attack on the United States., \"The implications of France,\" Bush said of this months rampage in Paris by Islamic extremists, \"should be  that it could happen here, and we need to keep our guard up. We cant just keep pulling back.\", Bush, who has spent the last few weeks feverishly fundraising, made no mention of the large field of potential Republican rivals until asked in a subsequent question-and-answer session about his closed-door meeting Thursday in Utah with Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee. Romney unexpectedly announced this month a desire to pursue a third try for the White House in 2016., The meeting, which was scheduled before Romney publicly expressed his interest, apparently did not dissuade either man from a race that could find the two political scions competing for support among the same base of establishment Republicans and business-minded donors., Stating his respect and personal regard for his prospective rival, Bush said he and Romney -- the son of a Michigan governor who ran for president -- dwelled mostly on policy matters. \"The awkward side of this, Bush said, about running and stuff, we put aside.\", Much of his message, delivered in a conversational style with only an occasional glance at notes, could have come from any of the roughly dozen or so Republicans eyeing a 2016 bid., Bushs call for greater accountability in education, for less tax money going to Washington and fewer government constraints on business have been standard GOP fare for decades. He joined the chorus in his party calling for construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline and condemning the Affordable Care Act, which he called a \"monstrosity.\", Where he most notably broke with others was his discussion of immigration policy. While calling for tougher border enforcement, Bush coupled that with support for legal protection for the millions of Americans in the country illegallya nonstarter for many in the GOP., \"There is no way that theyre going to be deported,\" Bush said. \"No ones suggesting an organized effort to do that; the cost of that would be extraordinary. We need to find a way where if they pay fines, they learn English, they work and they get in the back of the line but theyve come out of the shadows.\", While unstinting in his criticism of Obama, Bush also implicitly chided those in the party who have thrived on bashing the president, suggesting that opprobrium is no substitute for a substantive, forward-looking agenda., At one point, consciously or not, he echoed one of the major themes of Obama&#39;s 2008 campaign when asked what major message Republicans could bring. \"Hope,\" Bush responded, adding that \"it has to be grounded in a positive message, not a reactionary message.\", He said the country was starving for leadership and pointedly invoked not just Republicanslike his father and Ronald Reaganbut Democrats John F. Kennedy, whom he praised for launching the crash program to put a man on the moon, and Lyndon B.Johnson, whom he hailed for pushing through expansive civil rights legislation., Too many people in Washington blame the dog eatin their homework over and over and over again, Bush said in one of several jabs at the Beltway and its caustic political culture. Washington, he went on, is overpopulated with too many academics and political hacks with a hard-core ideology., \"Theyre basically Maytag repairmen,\" he said, offering no differentiation between Democrat and Republican. \"Nothing gets done.\", Bush, who committed to the San Francisco event months before publicly stating his intentions to explore a White House bid, was one of three speakers paid to address theNational Automobile Dealers Assn. convention., Former Tonight Show host Jay Leno and motivational speaker Beck Weathers were also compensated to appear this weekend, according to a spokesman for the organization, who declined to reveal how much each was paid., mark.barabak@latimes.com, Follow  @markzbarabak fornational & California politics, 7:46 p.m.: This article was updated with more comments from Bush., It was originally published at 5:46 p.m.]", "Date": "20150123", "Title": "[Jeb Bush sketches out 2016 themes, prods GOP to be upbeat]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-jeb-bush-2016-san-francisco-20150123-story.html", "Author": "[Mark Z.

{"Content": "[[, Somehow, 40 years into a political career that was crowned by his election as Hawaiis governor, Neil Abercrombie ignored the most basic lesson of the trade: Its a popularity contest., After years of antagonizing not just partisan opponents but key elements of his own Democratic Party, retaliation came Saturday in the form of an epic thumping. Abercrombie lost his partys primary by 35 points to state Sen. David Ige, who campaigned on his mastery of the state budget but implicitly promised a return to the more workman-like, less bombastic style that defined Hawaiis political class before Abercrombie., The depth of anger toward the incumbent was evident in two statistics: Abercrombie, 76, lost to a candidate he outspent by a 10-1 margin. And he lost to a candidate who, one poll showed, was unknown to almost 4 in 10 Hawaii Democrats as recently as February., Iges victory highlighted a strange primary election for Hawaii, and one that will not end for weeks: Two Democrats vying for the party nomination for a U.S. Senate seat were separated by about 1,600 votes, and the outcome of the race may hinge on ballots yet to be cast in two precincts where voting was canceled because of Fridays pounding from Tropical Storm Iselle., State elections officials said that voters who had not otherwise cast ballots in the Big Island precincts will be mailed new ones, which must be returned within three weeks. But the timing of the start of that process was not clear Sunday, nor was it clear how the Senate candidates would marshal their forces to campaign in the damaged areas., Some strategists said that both Abercrombies trouncing and Sen. Brian Schatzs narrow lead over Rep. Colleen Hanabusa in a race he was expected to easily win suggested that Asian American voters in particular had rallied to Ige and Hanabusa to the detriment of the incumbents., The races were fraught with ethnic divisions driven in part by the circumstances of Schatz appointment by Abercrombie to the Senate seat held until his death by Daniel Inouye. In a deathbed missive, the 50-year senator had made clear he wanted Hanabusa to be appointed to his seat, but Abercrombie sided instead with his lieutenant governor, Schatz., Then, pouring acid into the wound, Abercrombie earlier this year suggested in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that someone other than Inouye had manufactured the imprimatur. (He later apologized to Inouyes widow Irene but insisted the senator had given him free rein to pick his successor.), The contretemps escalated what was already a perilous circumstance for the first-term governor and, before that, legislator and member of Congress. Jennifer Duffy, who studies governors races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said that after his comments on Inouye, people kind of looked at him in a different light., A lot of it is just self-inflicted, she said., Indeed, Abercrombie entered the race woefully weakened  one poll said almost half of Hawaiians had a negative view of him  which required him to both curry favor among his fellow Democrats and run an artful campaign. Those who watched his fall said he did neither., Barely six months after his election, he angered the tourism industry  the states biggest source of income by saying that it was so stupid for the state to pay to host the NFL Pro Bowl, a game that generated upwards of $30 million in visitor spending and state tax revenue., He alienated the states teachers union by imposing a contract upon it during labor negotiations; the union became an early and important backer of Ige., And then he cast aspersions on Inouyes braintrust and by extension the states largest voting group, Asian Americans, and inflamed the elbowing between them and the more liberal white voting bloc that was Abercrombie and Schatz power base., \"This is a very small place and people have very long memories,\" said Floyd Takeuchi, a writer and former political journalist. Abercrombies campaign \"seriously misjudged the depth of the old guards ability to organize\" against him, Takeuchi said., Ben Tulchin, a California-based Democratic pollster who has worked extensively in Hawaii for independent groups, said Abercrombie ran,quite frankly, one of the worst campaigns imaginable for an incumbent in trouble., Time after time, he said, Abercrombies antagonistic style pushed aside voters he needed, even if he eventually worked his way toward their views when it came to policy. A personality that was bearable when he was working in the statehouse or in far-off Washington became less so in the higher profile, in-your-living-room role of governor., Strategically, Tulchin said, Abercrombie negated his overwhelming financial advantage by refusing to define Ige before Ige had the money to define himself. In hewing to Hawaiis traditional distaste for negative campaigning, he gave up one of the few options left to an unpopular politician., If youre an incumbent who is in trouble and you have the resources, it cant just be a referendum on you, Tulchin said. You have to tell others why the other guy is worse than you. The Abercrombie campaign refused to do that., In the end, being the anti-Abercrombie  and a quieter, less annoying presence  was more than enough for Ige. The question now is whether it will carry him to victory in November. The general election race will feature three major candidates:Ige, Republican Duke Aiona and independent Mufi Hanneman., While Ige easily outdistanced all other candidates Saturday, he opens the campaign with little money, if some momentum from his victory. Although Democrats control the state, three-way races are notoriously difficult to predict and the winner may be dictated by where Hanneman gets his voters, analyst Duffy said., If he pulls votes from Ige, this is really a race, she said., The winner of the Democratic Senate primary is expected to have no such difficulty against Republican Cam Cavasso; both Schatz and Hanabusa drew four times the votes he did. For that reason, the race is not expected to alter the balance of power in the Senate. The winner will hold the seat until 2016, the conclusion of Inouyes original term., In the Senate race, it was all about the primary, pollster Tulchin said., For political news and analysis, follow me on Twitter: @cathleendecker]", "Date": "20140810", "Title": "['Self-inflicted' wounds led to Hawaii governor's defeat, analysts say]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-how-hawaii-governor-lost-self-inflicted-wounds-20140810-story.html", "Author": "[Cathleen Decker]"}

We are on the right side of history, Graham said Thursday in a statement. I look forward to leading this long-overdue effort and pushing for a roll-call vote in theSenate., Graham, a staunch anti-abortion advocate, has long backed the ban. The chance to push for a vote on the issue will no doubt help him appeal to the core Republican voters hes courting in the primaries., But Grahams proposal highlighted a divide between the interests of the presidential contenders as they claw through the primary season and those of their Senate colleagues looking at tough elections in swing states next year., Democrats are eager to see Republicans focus on so-called culture war issues, rather than the economy., They quickly cast Grahams legislation as evidence of the partys extreme views and pounced on the handful of swing-state Republican senators, sending out newsreleases accusing the GOP majority of attacking womens health., In 2016, voters in Ohio  men and women alike  will remember thatRob Portmanwas more interested in playing politics with womens health than in moving our country forward, strengthening our economy, and working to end the dysfunction in Washington, Sadie Weiner, spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, declared in one such statement., Some polling shows that a ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy isnt an idea that Americans regard as extreme. A 2013 Washington Post poll found56% of Americans would support such a measure. Other polls have seen similar results., At the same time, polls have shown a shift to a more socially liberal electorate in recent years. Gallup last month found that50% of Americans identify as advocates of abortion rights,while 44% of Americans call themselves abortion foes. It was the first time since 2008 that support for abortion rights had a statistically significant advantage, the pollster said., Thats the sort of data thatmake some Republicans worry about elevating the issue at all in a general election  particularly in swing states like Ohio or New Hampshire, where incumbent Republican Sen.Kelly Ayottecould face a strong challenge., Time spent on the stump explaining the details of a vote on banning some abortions may play into the Democrats agenda, they fear., Its not clear whetherGOP senators will face a vote on the ban. Senate Majority LeaderMitch McConnell(R-Ky.), a co-sponsor of the bill, said last year that he would bring it up for a vote, but he has not mentioned timing since the House passed a version of the bill last month., McConnell spokesman Don Stewart said Thursday he did not have an update., For more on politics, follow@khennesseyon Twitter.]", "Date": "20150611", "Title": "[Abortion ban proposal could help in GOP primaries but hurt in Senate]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-abortion-bill-20150611-story.html", "Author": "[Kathleen Hennessey]"}
{"Content": "[[, Something unusual happened in Congress this week: Senators voted -- not just once or twice, but more than 20 times, right up until midnight Thursday., In contrast to the recent years of gridlock and paralysis, senators took vote after politically tough vote as they worked their way through a stack of amendments to a bill to approve the Keystone XL pipeline., It was part of the so-called regular order that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed to deliver after Republicans took control of the chamber earlier this month. The Kentucky Republican promised to restore a more open process that many senators hungered for after Democrats ran the place with a tight grip during the previous eight years., But the process was not without its shortcomings and it remains unclear how long his grand experiment will last., Late Thursday, as midnight neared, McConnell abruptly shut down the Keystone debate, forcing senators to take a rapid-fire series of votes without allowing discussion., The scene led to awkward moments as Democratic senators shouted for a chance to be heard, even for just one minute., \"Mr. President! Mr. President!\" Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) hollered, trying to get the attention of the presiding officer. \"I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed one minute to speak on my amendment before it is voted upon.\", McConnell stood stoically at his desk and uttered the simple debate-squashing retort, \"I object.\", The episode became so politically toxic, it now threatens to delay or derail passage next week of the Keystone bill., On Friday, some frustrated Democrats who support the pipeline are hinting they may withhold their votes next week to advance the legislation., \"I think everybody understands, McConnell said late Thursday. We have been on this bill for a while. We have already had more roll call votes on this bill than the entire Senate had on every bill through the whole year of 2014. I think it is time that we start moving forward., Democrats cried foul, saying McConnell was jamming through the Keystone bill. They suggested it might have something to do with the airplanes waiting to usher Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) to a big Palm Springs weekend political retreat being sponsored by the billionaire Koch brothers., McConnells office put the blame squarely on Democrats for slow-walking the process and then objecting to offers he made for votes on their measures as they pursued even more time for debate., Suddenly the chamber erupted in familiar complaints that the majority party was silencing the minority, though this time the roles were reversed., \"Its sad to see Sen. McConnell shut down debate three weeks into the Republican Senate, and even sadder if hes doing it to let a few Republican senators skip town Friday for a retreat hosted by the Koch brothers, said the spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid., For the past two weeks, the Senate has been debating the controversial oil pipeline bill in a long, but largely congenial, process that kicked into gear a few days ago as senators began voting. It started as a textbook case of legislating as each side offered their amendments., There was even a moment of levity when the chamber agreed overwhelmingly, 98-1, to a Democratic measure that said simply: Climate change is real and not a hoax., In all, the Senate processed 24 amendments, most of them from Democrats, and McConnell appeared on track to wrap up the lesson in legislating with final passage of the Keystone bill next week., But the price of Thursdays session may be costly if it soured the mood among Democrats who support the pipeline project. Their votes will be needed Monday for a key vote. Republicans have a 54-seat majority, but they need 60 votes to overcome a Democratic filibuster by the pipelines opponents., \"To enable this vote on the Keystone pipeline to finally happen, we need to be able to debate and vote on amendments,\" said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, a chief Democratic champion of the Keystone project. \"I was disappointed that open debate was hindered.\", The open process has also forced the Republican senators to take the politically uncomfortable votes on amendments offered by Democrats that have almost zero chance of becoming law., Among them was an amendment to require the oil being shipped on the pipeline be used in the U.S. rather than exported, one to require that the project be constructed with only U.S.-made steel and other components, plus four other amendments related to climate change., They all failed -- and are sure to be incorporated into attack ads against Republican senators up for reelection in 2016., Follow @LisaMascaro for more Senate news]", "Date": "20150123", "Title": "[Keystone XL amendments had senators doing the unusual: voting ... a lot]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-keystone-amendments-senate-votes-20150123-story.html", "Author": "[Lisa Mascaro]"}
{"Content": "[[, Soon after she announced that she was running for president, Hillary Rodham Clinton positioned herself as a critic of big money in politics, even suggesting that she might endorse a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Courts Citizens United decision. Yet as The Times reported last week, Clinton is courting potential donors to Priorities USA Action, a \"super PAC\" that is not bound by the contribution limits that govern donations to candidates., Its not hypocritical to espouse new rules to govern election spending while taking advantage of existing laws. And its true that former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is also aggressively priming the super PAC pump. The problem is that using super PACS to chase campaign cash violates the spirit if not the letter of the law., Super PACs, made possible by Citizens United and a subsequent appeals court decision, are supposed to be independent political action committees, not extensions of candidates official campaigns. Yet the Federal Election Commission has been timid  and politically stymied  in defining what constitutes forbidden coordination between candidates and independent groups., The result is a situation in which, as one legal expert puts it, super PACs function as \"alter egos\" for official campaign committees without being subject to the same contribution limits and other restrictions. That undermines the argument enunciated by the Supreme Court that independent political expenditures create less of a potential for corruption than direct contributions to a candidates campaign., Given the paralysis on the FEC, the only realistic way to rein in super PACs is for Congress to act. A bill sponsored by Reps. David Price (D-N.C.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) would put teeth into the ban on coordination, and effectively shut down \"alter ego\" PACs., For example, a super PACs activity would be considered \"coordinated\" if the group were founded or managed by a candidates former employees or consultants or if it communicated about campaign matters with a candidates relatives. And the bill would tighten up restrictions on candidates soliciting funds on behalf of Super PACs., These new rules would be a small step in the right direction., Cynics would argue that a Congress populated by politicians wont enact new restrictions on campaign fundraising. But in the past, Congress has done just that in response to public disgust at the corrosive effects of money on the democratic process, from Watergate to the use of the Lincoln bedroom as a hospitality suite for donors.

{"Content": "[[, Sorry to break the bad news to all you dreamy-eyed liberals, but its time to stop wishin and hopin: Elizabeth Warren isnt running for president. Really and truly., Progressive Democrats have bombarded her office with postcards, signed online petitions and stood in the snow waving signs to get the junior senator from Massachusetts to run., Warren didnt do much to encourage all this attention. Last fall when People magazine asked whether she would run, the senator wrinkled her nose, the magazine reported, and said, nondefinitively: I dont think so.... She then added, If theres any lesson Ive learned in the last five years, its dont be so sure about what lies ahead.... There are amazing doors that could open., Since then, though, Warren repeatedly has slammed one door shut. I am not running for president, shes said over and over. Shes pledged to serve her full term in the Senate through 2018. Of course, hardly anybody believes what a politician says, especially on the subject of career ambition. When Barack Obama arrived in the Senate in 2005, he too said he had no plans to run for president., But over the last few months, Democrats who do politics for a living have concluded Warren really means it based not on what shes said, but on what shes done  or, more precisely, left undone. She isnt traveling to Iowa or New Hampshire, Democratic strategist Tad Devine noted. She isnt putting together a team of people to build an organization. This is a case where no means no., Why wont Warren run?, A challenge to Hillary Rodham Clinton would be a grueling battle against tall odds. In national polls, Clinton wins the support of about 60% of Democrats, against only 11% for Warren. A face-off also would pit the Democrats two most prominent women against each other. It would be a bad day for Emilys List, said one Democratic operative., Warren is fiery about her favorite causes  such as reducing the influence of Wall Street banks  and yet thats not the same fire in the belly required to run for president. She describes herself as an outside agitator, not a deal-maker, and you cant be an outsider in the Oval Office., Last year she fought the Obama administration and her own partys Senate leadership to block the nomination of a former investment banker as undersecretary of the Treasury, and won  although the nominee, Antonio Weiss, got a job that didnt require Senate confirmation. Shes already signaled her opposition to President Obamas desired trade agreement with 11 countries around the Pacific., Thats why Warren is not running. But why has she been less than definitive? I suspect its because being considered a potential presidential candidate is a surefire way to get attention from the media for her causes and ideas. When Warren gave a speech to the AFL-CIO last month demanding legislation to break up the Wall Street banks, it won far more coverage because she might some day run for president., Theres one quick way to stop all the speculation: Warren could formally endorse Hillary Clinton., On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that a secret meeting happened between the two in December. Clintons aim, the paper said, was to cultivate the increasingly influential senator  but she didnt ask explicitly for Warrens endorsement., Its going to be an interesting courtship given their prickly history. A 2003 book Warren co-wrote tartly denounced Clinton for failing to oppose bankruptcy legislation promoted by big banks: As First Lady, Mrs. Clinton had been persuaded that the bill was bad for families. As New Yorks newest senator, however, it seems that Hillary Clinton could not afford such a principled position., For Clinton, the price of an enthusiastic endorsement from Elizabeth Warren could be high. Warren may not expect Clinton to embrace her call to break up big banks, but shed like her to move more in that direction., Warren has been invited into the Senate leadership. Shes become one of the most influential Democrats in the country. Now she has the unofficial front-runner for her partys presidential nomination asking for her help. Not bad for a law professor who just completed her second year in office., Besides, she hasnt closed the door on running in 2020., doyle.mcmanus@latimes.com, Twitter: @DoyleMcManus, Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion and Facebook]", "Date": "20150217", "Title": "[Forget it, liberals: Elizabeth Warren is not running for president]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0218-mcmanus-elizabeth-warren-2016-20150218-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}

Mao replaced Jiang Yi-huah, who stepped down on Saturday as election results came in. On Monday his whole Cabinet, including 23 department heads, resigned., Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou, meanwhile, has quit as chairman of the Nationalist Party after five years on the job to apologize for the election losses. The party picked Vice President Wu Den-yih as interim chair. The partys secretary-general also left., These election losses tell us that our reforms arent fast enough and we still cant meet peoples expectations, Ma said in his resignation speech Wednesday, bowing for 10 seconds during what was his second public apology since Saturday. Possibly I havent done well enough., The Nationalist Party lost nine mayoral and county magistrate posts on Saturday after opinion polls have forecast the party would surrender just three. The opposition Democratic Progressive Party picked up seven seats for an overall majority, and independents were elected to two., Since Ma took office in 2008, the government has broken 65 years of icy relations with Beijing, which claims sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan and wants the island to reunify with the mainland. Dialogue with Beijing has produced 21 agreements on trade, transit and investment, bolstering Taiwans export-reliant economy while giving Beijing hope for reunification through economic interdependence., The opposition DPP says it favors dialogue with the mainland but asks that Beijing not treat Taiwan as part of the same country; Communist leaders in Beijing reject that precondition., Analysts in Taiwan regard the ruling partys losses at the local level as a vote against the central government, which many people blame for slow-growing wages and high housing prices on parts of the island. Many also want the government to slow down the pace of agreements with China, warning that over-dependence on the mainlands $10-trillion economy could lead to excessive pressure to unify politically., Recent resignations will let the Nationalists install new leaders who are younger and more in tune with what the electorate wants before the 2016 presidential race, said Alexander Huang, strategic studies professor at Tamkang University in Taiwan., They will make sure they have a combat team for the next presidential election, Huang said., The new Cabinet may be instructed to avoid more major deals, such as free-trade agreements, with mainland China to avoid inciting further backlash from voters, analysts say. China wants to sign more agreements but also wants to see the Nationalists reelected in 2016, they say., Im pretty pessimistic about cross-strait relations from now through the next presidential election, said Wu Chung-li, research fellow at Taipei-based institute Academia Sinica.

The law would take effect statewide in July if the referendum does not qualify., \"To ensure the integrity of the state referendum process is not tarnished by criminal behavior, we request an immediate investigation into these disturbing reports of voter fraud during circulation of the Referendum to Overturn Ban on Single-Use Plastic Bags petition,\" wrote attorney Lance Olson, representing the group supporting the ban., He submitted the names of 50 voters who felt they were not given an accurate description of the referendum by the signature gatherers. Some voters, including Anita Simons of La Jolla, said that petition gatherers told them the referendum was to get rid of the 10-cent charge for alternative bags, but if voters defeat the referendum it will repeal the entire law., \"Its become clear that signature gatherers are saying and doing anything to trick voters into signing these petitions,\" said Mark Murray, a spokesman for Californians Against Waste. \"Given the overwhelming strong support for the law, its not surprising that this turkey of a referendum attempt issuch a hard sell.\", Representatives of the bag makers did not immediately have a response to the complaint., However, Lee Califf, the alliances executive director, said his group is on track to qualify the referendum., The APBA is confident the required number of signatures will be submitted by the deadline and the referendum against SB 270 will be qualified, Califf said in a statement.

{"Content": "[[, Tax reform is revving up again on Capitol Hill, with the heads of key committees pledging to work toward a simpler and fairer tax code, possibly one with lower tax rates. Sounds intriguing., But what might that mean for homeowners? Many benefit from tax breaks such as mortgage interest and property tax deductions, plus tax-free write-offs of up to $250,000 or $500,000 of home sale capital gains, depending on whether they file returns as singles or married couples. Renters get none of these., Homeowner write-offs become targets for cutbacks or elimination whenever tax code reforms get serious attention because of their costs in uncollected federal revenue. The mortgage interest deduction alone will cost the Treasury $113.4 billion in fiscal 2015, and property tax write-offs will cost $27.8 billion, according to estimates by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation., President Obama kicked off the tax legislative season with a budget proposal that would limit mortgage interest and other deductions for upper-income taxpayers. No surprise there. He called for essentially the same change last year, and this years version was widely viewed as dead on arrival in a Congress controlled by Republicans., But what might Republican tax reformers themselves have up their sleeves? Last February the top Republican tax writer, Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, then chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, came out with a massive tax code overhaul blueprint that would offer lower tax rates and a big increase in the standard deduction in exchange for drastic cutbacks in special-interest deductions and credits, including the benefits traditionally enjoyed by homeowners., Camps plan would have shrunk marginal rates for most taxpayers to just two brackets, 10% and 25%; phased down mortgage interest deductions from the current $1-million limit on eligible mortgage amounts to $500,000; eliminated deductions on home equity loans and credit lines; and stretched out the time period needed to qualify for tax-free capital gains exclusions from the present two years out of the preceding five years to five years out of the preceding eight years. Camps plan also would have eliminated homeowners write-offs of local property tax payments and ended penalty-free withdrawals from individual retirement accounts to assist with first-time home purchases., Camp retired from Congress at the end of the last session. His reform plans  considered too controversial to pass in an election year  never moved out of committee. But the impetus for some sort of wholesale reform of the sprawling Internal Revenue Code remains alive and well. Is anything likely or even possible this year, and if so, could it create problems for current or future homeowners?, Conversations with tax experts and Capitol Hill legislative analysts suggest a couple of things: There is bipartisan support for the broad concept of streamlining the tax code. The new Ways and Means Committee chairman, Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), said on NBCs \"Meet the Press\" that he is prepared to work on reforms with the White House  even compromise on some issues  \"if we can find common ground.\" Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), Senate Finance Committee chairman, has created working groups tasked with coming up with tax reform plans with the objective of introducing a bill, probably by late this spring., And there is already common ground to build on: bipartisan support, including at the White House, for a broad package of tax changes affecting businesses. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew recently said the administration could support reforms that lower top tax rates for big corporations, eliminate unfair loopholes and simplify the entire system for businesses. Republicans generally are on board but insist that small businesses be part of the solution., So theres a chance that a bipartisan corporate tax reform bill could be cobbled together this year, provided that negotiations are completed before the start of the next presidential campaign season this fall., What about comprehensive tax reforms for individuals of the type that inevitably would involve significant changes in current preferences for homeowners and tax increases for higher-income households? Highly unlikely. Congressional Republicans and the White House have such conflicting views of the tax system  Obama wants to raise taxes on the wealthy, Republicans vehemently oppose any net new taxes  that coming together on a major reform package covering individuals would be nothing short of miraculous., Bottom line: Homeowner tax breaks are safe for the time being, probably until 2017 at the earliest., kenharney@earthlink.net, Distributed by Washington Post Writers Group.]", "Date": "20150215", "Title": "[Homeowner tax breaks are probably safe despite moves in Congress]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/la-fi-harney-20150215-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}

They buttress the two major parties, as a vital source of campaign cash, as red and blue emblems and, in presidential races, as a big chunk of their Electoral College base., Democrats last carried Texas in 1976. Republicans havent won California since 1988., There have been attempts., In 1988, Democrat Michael Dukakis picked Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as his running mate in a reach to win the Lone Star state. Dukakis ended up losing Texas by 13 points., In 2000, George W. Bush targeted California and boldly stumped in the state on the last weekend of the hairs-breadth campaign. He lost California by 11 points and might have better spent his time in Florida., Since then, no fall presidential candidate has expended serious effort in either Texas or California, each party effectively ceding one megastate to the other. (Here we discount fundraising stops and springtime platitudes about running a 50-state campaign on the theory that what matters is spending money and the appearances candidates make after Labor Day.), But change, partisans insist, is in the offing., Democrats will tell you Texas is growing more competitive, as Latino voters gain in numbers and political strength. Republicans say California is ripe for realignment, as Democrats overreach in Sacramento and divisions open between coastal liberals and more conservative voters inland., There will likely be little evidence of either occurring Tuesday., Both Texas and California are in the midst of attemped reclamation projects, an effort to rebuild struggling parties from the ground up, led by a pair of underdog candidates for governor, Democrat Wendy Davis and Republican Neel Kashkari., Davis catapulted to international celebrity after an 11-hour filibuster to block tough anti-abortion legislation from passing the Texas Senate. Kashkari, a businessman unknown even in parts of California, was the favorite of the GOP establishment over a tea party challenger who, party powers feared, would only further antagonize centrist Californians., Both have strived to distance themselves from the extremes associated with Washington and, more, their own parties., Kashkari has aligned himself with Californias live-and-let-live credo by endorsing same-sex marriage and legal abortion, and broken with GOP orthodoxy by, among other positions, supporting background checks for gun buyers and a path to citizenship for people in the country illegally., Davis, like the conservative Democrats who once prevailed in Texas, has run on a largely pro-business platform, endorsed \"open carry\" legislation allowing pistols to be worn in public view and even supported a 20-week limit on abortions, which was the aim of the bill she filibustered. (Though Davis qualifier that women and their doctors should have discretion in choosing abortion in cases beyond 20 weeks would effectively nullify that legal limit.), Changing the political complexion of states as big as Texas and California, however, seems too monumental for either candidate; both Davis and Kaskhari seem certain to lose Nov. 4. The only question is how badly., If Davis, for all her celebrity and formidable fundraising, suffers the same nearly 13-point margin of defeat as Houston Mayor Bill White in 2010  or loses even bigger  it would be hard to argue she made much of a Democratic dent in fortress Texas. (It would also be a blow to the savants behind President Obamas targeting-and-turnout operation, who launched the much-hyped Battleground Texas in a bid to hasten a red-to-blue conversion.), Similarly, if Kashkari finishes in the 38%-to-42% range of recent GOP gubernatorial hopefuls not named Arnold Schwarzenegger, he might have saved the wear and tear by spending the past year body-surfing at home in Orange County., True, Republicans might gain a California toehold if down-ballot candidates Ashley Swearengin or Pete Peterson win their competitive races for controller or secretary of state  though both conspicuously distanced themselves from the GOP, even going so far as to refuse to endorse Kashkari., In short, dont expect to see much of the Democratic presidential ticket in Texas or the Republicans in California after Labor Day 2016., Maybe in 2020., mark.barabak@latimes.com, Twitter: @markzbarabak]", "Date": "20141101", "Title": "[Partisan hurdles too high for Davis in Texas, Kashkari in California]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-pol-california-politics-20141102-story.html", "Author": "[Mark Z.

Rick Perry vigorously denounced on Saturday an indictment charging him with abusing his power by targeting the states ethics watchdog and said his accusers wrongly sought to criminalize the proper dispatch of his duties., I wholeheartedly and unequivocally stand behind my veto, Perry said in a brief appearance before reporters in Austin, breaking his public silence and defending his action on the state budget that led to Fridays indictment. \"And Ill continue to defend this lawful action of my executive authority as governor.\", We dont settle political differences with indictments in this country, said Perry, wagging an accusatory finger. It is outrageous that some would use partisan political theatrics to rip away at the very fabric of our states constitution., This indictment amounts to nothing more than abuse of power, Perry went on forcefully, and I cannot and will not allow that to happen., Perry was indicted Friday by a grand jury in the state capital of Austin on two felony counts that stemmed from his veto of $7.5 million in funding for the states ethics watchdog., Perry, the longest-serving governor in Texas history, has announced he would not seek another term and will step down in early January after 14 years in office., He has spent the past several months visiting key political states and traveling abroad, seeking to rehabilitate himself after his unsuccessful 2012 presidential bid and position himself for another try in 2016., His indictment poses a new hurdle to that comeback effort, but also presents an opportunity to rally support from those who may see him as the victim of a politically motivated persecution., The tendency is just to look at the headline first: Governor Perry indicted,  said Stuart Rothenberg, an independent campaign analyst and publisher of the Rothenberg Political Report. The question is does Rick Perry use this in a way to energize Republican primary voters, activists and contributors who may be receptive to a message of, Boy, those Democrats are trying to destroy me because Ive been effective and Im a threat to them down the road. , The Office of Public Integrity, which investigates elected officials in Texas, is housed in the office of Travis County Dist. Atty. Rosemary Lehmberg, a Democrat who had clashed with Republicans over her aggressive oversight., After her conviction last year on drunken driving charges, Perry threatened the units funding unless Lehmberg stepped down. He said he could not support continued funding for an office with statewide jurisdiction at a time when the person charged with ultimate responsibility for that unit has lost the publics confidence.\", Lehmberg served about half of a 45-day jail sentence but refused to quit, and Perry followed through on his veto threat, prompting a government watchdog group to file a complaint saying Perrys actions amounted to improper intimidation. A special prosecutor was appointed and several top aides to Perry appeared before the Austin grand jury for questioning. The governor did not testify., Critics of Perry note that at the time funding for Lehmbergs office was cut, the public corruption unit was investigating one of the governors pet projects, the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas. Question have surfaced regarding funding of the institute and money given to some of the governors close allies; a former institute official has been indicted for his handling of an $11-million state grant., Perry was charged with one count of abuse of official capacity, which carries a penalty of five to 99 years in prison, and one count of coercion of a public servant, which carries a punishment of two to 10 years in prison., The prospect of jail time was less acute, however, than the political ramifications for Perrys 2016 hopes., Fellow Republicans were quick to rally to Perrys side., Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called the governor a friend... a man of integrity and used a Twitter hashtag to say he was proud to #StandWithRickPerry., Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana posted a series of tweets defending Perry and calling his indictment a blatant misuse of the judicial system by liberal activists who couldnt defeat him at the polls., A third potential GOP candidate, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, agreed., \"The indictment of @GovernorPerry seems politically motivated and ridiculous,\" he tweeted. \"Major overreach and an encroachment on his veto authority.\", Even some Democrats questioned the case against Perry, for whom they otherwise have little regard., David Axelrod, the longtime Democratic strategist and advisor to President Obama, said on Twitter, Unless he was demonstrably trying to scrap the ethics unit for other than his stated reason, Perry indictment seems pretty sketchy., Follow @markzbarabak, if youd like, for more news and political analysis.]", "Date": "20140816", "Title": "[Texas Gov.

{"Content": "[[, The 2010 healthcare reform law sought to extend coverage to millions of uninsured Americans, not just to improve their care but also to promote a more efficient healthcare system. The law left out one large group of uninsured people, however: those who were living in the country illegally. State Sen. Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens) wants to rectify that omission by providing subsidized insurance policies for noncitizen Californians with low incomes. Bringing everyone under the insurance umbrella is the right long-term goal, but Laras bill isnt the right way to achieve it., Laras ambitious proposal, SB 1005, would use state funds to provide insurance benefits to all those whose immigration status render them ineligible for federal aid. For impoverished newly arrived legal residents, and those who are here illegally, it would provide full-scale Medi-Cal, the states version of Medicaid. Under current law, those individuals qualify only for a scaled-back plan that covers emergencies, pregnancies and some chronic diseases. The proposal would also require Covered California, the states new marketplace for private insurance policies, to offer subsidized coverage to low- and moderate-income immigrants through a separate exchange., One rationale for extending coverage to everyone is that the uninsured will obtain treatment regardless, typically when their problems are acute  and costly. Those expenses are passed on to taxpayers and to people with insurance. By offering subsidized policies to the uninsured poor, the state can shift people into preventive and managed care, saving money in the long run., Thats true. But before the state expands its safety net, it needs to repair the rips and tears made during the budget crises of the last recession. Those include the reductions in Medi-Cal payment rates that have shrunk the ranks of doctors in the program, a problem exacerbated by the growing number of Californians enrolling. Although the same discipline to fix programs before expanding them should apply across the budget, its particularly relevant in healthcare, where the cost per beneficiary has gone in only one direction: up. According to a report released Thursday by UC Berkeley and UCLA, the added cost of just the Medi-Cal portion of Laras bill would rise from about $360 million in 2015 to about $430 million in 2019., Besides, the moral and practical arguments in favor of covering all low-income people are just as strong in the other 49 states as they are in California. A better approach would be for Congress and President Obama to plug the gap by amending the Affordable Care Act or by enacting a comprehensive immigration reform law that provides a path to legal residency and citizenship for the millions of people living here illegally. Until Washington acts, lawmakers here should focus on fixing the states safety net, not straining it further.]", "Date": "20140522", "Title": "[This bill isn't the way to help immigrants afford healthcare ]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-lara-medi-cal-expansion-20140523-story.html", "Author": "[The Times Editorial Board]"}
{"Content": "[[, The 2016 presidential contest descended upon Iowa on Saturday in a marathon bout of political speed-dating that did little to clarify the vast choices likely to face Republican voters over the next year., In 20-minute bursts of staccato flirting, more than half a dozen more-or-less top-tier Republican presidential possibilities paraded across a stage in a historic theater near downtown Des Moines, their appearances interspersed with those from Iowa elected officials., The blandishments  over more than nine hours and from a cast that ranged from serious contenders to Sarah Palin and Donald Trump  came about a year before Iowans will cast the first votes on the road to the White House, a road that will take most candidates through nearly all of this states 99 counties. , By the end Saturday night, two themes were evident: the persistent cleavages in the party as it seeks to unify control over Washington by seizing the White House in 2016, and the gravitational pull to the right that will tempt or torment all top candidates in this state, which includes loud ranks of tea party and religious voters., The two themes coalesced with repeated criticism, both blunt and shaded, of the most prominent potential candidates not in attendance: Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush. Both are viewed with differing levels of suspicion for different reasons  Romney for his failure to win the race as the partys 2012 nominee, and Bush for his embrace of education standards and immigration changes that drew repeated rebukes from the stage., The sharpest criticism, which drew hoots of support from the audience, came from Trump, reprising his quadrennial will-he-or-wont-he-run high jinks., It cant be Mitt because Mitt ran and failed. You cant have Romney; he choked, said Trump, who endorsed Romney in 2012., And, he went on, You cant have Bush. The last thing we need is another Bush., Trump blamed Bushs brother, President George W. Bush, for being the man who gave us Obama, and he criticized the former Florida governors support for Common Core education standards and legal protection for immigrants in the country illegally. , Remember his statement: They came for love, Trump said as he mocked a comment Jeb Bush made about immigrants entering the U.S. illegally. Half of them are criminals; theyre coming for love?, Trump was here as entertainment  few if any believe he would actually run  but the applause greeting his remarks suggested his sentiments were broadly shared., The Iowa gathering came on a busy weekend for a contest that has flared to life with Bushs announcement in December that he was considering running, and Romneys subsequent disclosure of his interest in a third presidential campaign. This weekend in Palm Springs, conservative donors are gathering for a regular meeting organized by billionaires Charles and David Koch; three prospective candidates  Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida  are scheduled to appear., While joining in on criticism of Romney and Bush, the audience for the Iowa event, organized by the Citizens United political group and conservative U.S. Rep. Steve King of Iowa, saved its most vocal support for Cruz and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Tonally and in emphasis, they represent vastly different approaches. That alone portends clashes as GOP voters try to come to some agreement about what type of candidate they find most attractive. , Walker, who won Republican loyalty for facing down public employee unions in his state, said he and some other governors had enacted common sense policies at the state level that provided a template for a national run., Enthusiastic but reasoned, he pointed to measures that protected gun rights, defunded Planned Parenthood, limited lawsuits and cut regulations on farms and small business. A roar arose when he noted that we require in our state, by law, a photo ID to vote., Thats the difference between the Wisconsin way and the Washington way, he said., Cruz, a first-term senator who was a major force in shutting down the government in his first months in office, was far more fiery as he repeatedly demanded what amounted to litmus tests on conservative issues., If a candidate says he opposes President Obamas executive actions on immigration policy, show me where you stood up and fought, he said. , Conservatives need to send the locusts of the EPA back to Washington from the states, he said, and to abolish the IRS  a frequent target Saturday., There are 110,000 employees at the IRS, he joked. We need to padlock that building and put all of those 110,000 on our southern border., A third approach was forwarded by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who Iowa political observers say has cultivated the state for years and built a team of supporters ready to jump in when he makes a presidential announcement., He spoke at length about his antiabortion views in what appeared to be an effort to blunt assertions that a blue-state governor was wiggly on a bedrock issue for conservative Iowa voters. He also noted the anxiety he found in Americans as he crossed the country before the 2014 election. He tied it to stagnant incomes that have left voters uneasy about the future. , There is uncertainty in our country, and it is a product of the failure of leadership, he said. And that failure has happened at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue., The event made evident the pressure on candidates to hew to the conservative line or, presumably, suffer when the caucuses come around. Party leaders have long sought to lower the volume on discussions that might further distance women, Latinos and young people from Republicans, a problem that haunted Romney and promises more trouble as those voter groups grow., But from the stage, there were multiple discussions of abortion. Carly Fiorina, the 2010 California Senate candidate who is pondering a run, castigated House Republicans for tripping last week when they sought a ban on abortions for pregnancies over 20 weeks., Rep. Kings presence meant that immigration was a certain topic; after last weeks State of the Union address, he had criticized the president for inviting someone King called a deportable to the event., Several people bearing signs emblazoned with the word stood during speeches by Christie and Texas Gov. Rick Perry and denounced the speakers association with King. The protesters were taken out of the theater by police., Before that, however, the tone had been set by the emcee, radio host Jan Mickelson, when he said that immigration would not be a big element of the campaign., But, he said, What we do care about is illegal gate-crashers., , For political news and analysis, follow me on Twitter: @cathleendecker , 9:44 p.m.: This post has been updated throughout., This post was originally published at 6:30 p.m.]", "Date": "20150124", "Title": "[Cruz, Christie, Walker, other Republicans land in Iowa.

{"Content": "[[, The 2016 presidential election is attracting an unusually large number of hopefuls. The Republicans will probably field more than a dozen candidates and the Democrats, as many as five. Presently, very few of these supposed contenders have a real chance of becoming president. Republicans Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina and Ted Cruz are long shots. On the Democratic side, that term applies to everyone but Hillary Rodham Clinton., But the size of the crowd isnt terribly surprising; if anything I thought it might be even larger. The barriers to entry are low, and all a candidate needs to keep going, at least in this preliminary stage, is money. That isnt so hard to find anymore given Internet fundraising and the seemingly endless supply of mega-rich patrons who funnel their wealth through super PACs. Money breeds media attention breeds more money., For registered Democrats and Republicans, it is easy to get on primary ballots and easy to succumb to flattery. Why, Sen. Rubio, you are a youthful fresh face, possessing humble immigrant beginnings. You are the embodiment of the American dream, and you come across well on television. You attract rich patrons. You could go all the way. No one in his circle of admirers would call him a rookie., On the Democratic side, Clinton is way ahead in the polls, leaving Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Gov. Martin OMalley, former Sen. Jim Webb and former Gov. Lincoln Chafee in the low single digits. , If you tell them in private, You do not have a chance to be president, they will point to underdogs who won, such as Jimmy Carter or Ronald Reagan, or front-runners who faltered  such as Clinton herself in 2008. They all harbor the belief that they can catch fire, especially during the primary debates. They know that Clinton could falter yet again; if so, they will be ready., Short of winning the presidency, however, there are many other rewards for running., You can fatten your mailing list and your Rolodex for future opportunities. These can include lucrative jobs, retainers, paid speeches or book advances. After 2008, former Gov. Mike Huckabee made it to Fox News and, by staying in the limelight, set himself up for a second run., Of course, these candidates will claim, some truthfully, that what they really want is for daily audiences to absorb their strongly held convictions and policy ideas. What better way to make yourself heard than a presidential candidacy? All you have to do is show up and talk every day. The media will listen  at least if you have the money and belong to one of the major parties., If these candidates had distinct agendas challenging entrenched crony corporate power or citizen-disempowerment policies, they could enrich immeasurably the campaigns and bring out more demanding voters with higher expectation levels., Alas, Sanders may be the only major-party candidate who actually advances Main Street over Wall Street. The others do little more than replicate their partys line, albeit garnished with different slogans and labels., Fiorina has run a big business, poorly. Carson is known as a pioneering surgeon on a surgical Washington mission. Jeb Bush, Rick Perry and Scott Walker want to lead America as they have governed Florida, Texas and Wisconsin, respectively, leaving no powerful corporations behind. Rick Santorum is freedoms tribune (though he favors a slightly higher minimum wage), and beleaguered Chris Christie is trying to re-create the image of a governor who gets things done. , At least Rand Paul offers something a little different, but hes already showing signs of backtracking. Hes a conservative pulling back on empire, averse to corporate welfare and the defense of civil liberties  at least for now., Meanwhile, Clinton, the Democratic flag-bearer, spouts thinly veiled progressive rhetoric while keeping intact her core credentials as a corporatist and militarist., Thus far, the media is covering the candidates personal stories and will continue to mine biographical details, while waiting for gaffes, a self-destructive lapse or supposed scandal. The media will pretend that minor policy differences amount to different visions for how to lead the country., Taken as a whole, it is all so rancid. All this dreariness comes down to who is more likable with the most TV ads and superior campaign staff. The voters see themselves as mere spectators, grumbling along the way. They cant seem to make the candidates react to their needs. Theyre bored, and boredom often turns into cynicism and withdrawal (voters become nonvoters). When people have low expectations of politicians, the politicians will oblige them., Is there a way out of the cycle? Certainly the media could do better., The media love to cover horse races, especially when there is no clear front-runner in the polls. It loves patsy interviews filled with tactical questions that invite tactical answers. It hates to cover third-party candidates. Reporters think thats pointless, because those candidates have no chance., But as long as the media are covering candidates within the two major parties who will not be president, such as Fiorina, why not also cover candidates outside the duopoly who will not be president, such as Jill Stein of the Green Party? Third-party candidates can advance important agendas ignored by the mainstream  but which may have majoritarian support, either now or in the future  as they did in the 19th and early 20th centuries., Who first put forth issues such as the abolition of slavery, womens right to vote, social security, farm and labor reforms?

{"Content": "[[, The 2016 presidential election is more than two years away. Heck, the 2014 midterm election is still more than a month away. But its never too early to speculate about presidential nominations, especially for politicians who are thinking about running., Its no surprise that potential Republican candidates are already stumping around the country asking voters and contributors to take a look. Their field is wide open., But its a little more complicated for Democrats, with Hillary Rodham Clinton holding what looks like an unshakable lead in their polls. Still, at least four other Democrats are said to be thinking about jumping into the race  former Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer, Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and Vice President Joe Biden  as well as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the party., Shes going to be challenged by at least two or three others, predicted Tad Devine, a Democratic strategist who helped manage three presidential campaigns (and advised Sanders when he ran for the Senate). Hillarys the prohibitive front-runner, absolutely, but that can change very quickly once you get into a primary campaign., Clinton would face two challenges from all those upstarts  one domestic, the other foreign., On economics, all the potential Democratic candidates cast themselves as firmly with the 99%. They are decrying the long-term stagnation in middle-class incomes and calling for an end to the long stretch of tax cuts that have helped the affluent., Clinton sometimes sounds as if shes right there with them. This spring, she gave a speech comparing the current economy to the Gilded Age of the robber barons. But she hasnt been specific about the remedies shed propose, and her would-be competitors have sounded tougher on Wall Street, a position sure to win favor from economic liberals., Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, has said that if he runs, My job is to take on the billionaire class., And Schweitzer, a folksy, mercurial rancher turned politician, has publicly criticized Clintons reliance on high-finance contributors. If you can judge a persons character by the company they keep, in politics you can judge a person by the money they seek, he told the Wall Street Journal., On foreign policy, presumably one of Clintons selling points, she could find herself sandwiched between critics from the left and right., Sanders, to Clintons left on most issues, has frequently noted that he voted against the Iraq war in 2002 (Clinton voted for it), and last week he voted against authorizing the Obama administration to arm Syrian rebels., Webb, who has staked out domestic positions to Clintons right, is (to stretch an analogy) the Rand Paul of the Democratic Party  skeptical about most uses of military force. He opposed the 2011 U.S. intervention in Libya that Clinton championed. Last week he said that he thought President Obamas foreign policy, which Clinton helped shape, was a tangled mess., None of these upstarts, at this point, pose a serious threat to Clintons march to the Democratic nomination. The only one who has registered any consistent support in polling is Sanders  assuming he runs as a Democrat  and he shows up in fourth place, after Clinton, Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who insists she isnt running., But having little chance of winning isnt likely to stop them. Some of them, such as Sanders, will run in the hope of moving the party in their direction ideologically. Others  think OMalley and Schweitzer  will see running as at least a way to boost their name recognition, making it more likely they could land a future nomination  or be offered a place on the ticket as vice presidential nominee., Clinton would probably prefer not to have to spend time and money defending herself in the primaries. But, at least according to some campaign strategists, facing challengers might actually do her some good. Primary challenges will force Clinton to tune up her campaign organization. And they would enable her to make her pitch to a wider audience during the long primary season., I think shes absolutely better off with some opposition, said Devine. Otherwise youre in danger of spending six months in a black hole. You dont want to cede those six months to the other party while you sit there in your coronation robes. That wont play well., Still, contested primaries also offer a front-runner a chance to make mistakes. And Clintons history as a campaigner has been far from flawless. She started the 2008 Democratic presidential campaign as the prohibitive front-runner but lost to an upstart named Barack Obama. She launched her pre-campaign this year with a well-orchestrated book rollout, but made headlines by complaining that she and her husband were dead broke when they left the White House., And theres always a chance Clinton might decide not to run after all. Thats unlikely, but its still possible, a sometime Clinton advisor told me last week., In that case, all bets are off., doyle.mcmanus@latimes.com, Twitter: @doylemcmanus]", "Date": "20140923", "Title": "[Clinton's lead among Democrats in 2016 is clear -- which is complicated]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-mcmanus-column-democrat-candidates-president-20140924-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, The announcement came swiftly, catching many by surprise: After decades in Washington, the path-breaking U.S. senator announced she would retire after 2016., If the timing was unexpected, the response was predictable, years of pent-up ambition surging like water through a broken dam. A pair of formidable candidates quickly entered the race and several more immediately began sizing up their prospects., All of this happened recently in Maryland after Democrat Barbara Mikulski, the longest-serving woman in congressional history, revealed her plans to step aside., In California, meantime, Democrat Kamala Harris continues her cake-walking campaign to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, facing the slightest opposition in what promised, at first, to be an epic fight., While the lack of strong competition is surprising, the reasons are no mystery. (Requisite caveat: with more than a year until the June 2016 primary  a lifetime in politics, blah blah  much could change.), Part of the explanation speaks to individual motives; each of the potential top-shelf Democratic contenders had reasons for skipping the Senate contest. Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa would both rather be governor, a job that comes open after 2018, when the term-limited Jerry Brown steps aside., Other statewide officials who might have eyed a Senate bid  Treasurer John Chiang, Secretary of State Alex Padilla  were elected just last November, and it hardly would have been seemly to seek a new job a few months later. (Harris, fresh off reelection, had at least served a full term as attorney general.), Credit also goes to Harris, for her decisiveness. The former San Francisco district attorney started with several things going for her, among them solid support in the Bay Area, which routinely outvotes Southern California; her gender, an edge among Democratic voters  most of whom are women  and a job that has historically been a strong political jumping-off point., She built on those advantages by speedily entering the race, locking up donors and significant endorsements, thus making it harder for others to follow. Billionaire Tom Steyer, for one, was leaning toward a run until Harris got into the race, which abruptly changed his calculations., The comparison with Maryland, though, is instructive., Campaigning in a state with just two major media marketsBaltimore and the Washington, D.C., suburbsis a bargain compared to California, which has nearly a dozen in-state TV markets, stretching from San Diego to Redding almost 700 miles away. To blanket the state, candidates also need to buy TV time in parts of Arizona, Nevada and Oregon., The price tag for a meaningful television ad campaign is roughly $4.5 million a week and should run nonstop starting about six weeks from election day. (Most begin much earlier.) So thats nearly $30 million a Senate candidate needs to raise, bare minimum, for TV alone. Its a steep entry fee and a reason why Harris, who is busily socking away dollars, grows tougher to beat each passing day., Of course, the whole purpose of such advertising is to make a candidate known to voters. Thats a monumental undertaking in California, where the population of the Bay Area alone exceeds Maryland by 1 million residents., Maryland has eight House members, more than half of whom are either running to replace Mikulski or giving it serious thought. (As in California, the Democrats are strongly favored to hang on to the Senate seat in November.), \"You have lots of people with pretty good followings ... and the ability to generate voter and/or financial support,\" said Thomas Schaller, who teaches political science at the University of Marylands Baltimore County campus., Compare that to California, with 53 House members, most of whom are unknown to the average voter save, perhaps, for Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco., \"Being a member of Congress might make you a big shot in Washington, D.C,\" said longtime Democratic strategist Garry South. \"But out here, if you walk two or three blocks outside your district, no one would have a clue who you are.\", Consider Jane Harman. She was a respected three-term member of Congress from Los Angeles South Bay, with a decades-long Washington resume and deep pockets to finance her 1998 gubernatorial bid. She finished third in the free-for-all primary., On the not-distant horizon lies 2018. Along with an open governors seat, the election could bring another shot at an open U.S. Senate seat, should Democrat Dianne Feinstein  elected alongside Boxer in the states historic 1992 election  step aside., That prospect could be enough to encourage even the most restless office-seeker to sit tight just a few more years., Twitter: @markzbarabak]", "Date": "20150322", "Title": "[U.S. Senate race fails to strike expected sparks]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-pol-california-politics-20150322-story.html", "Author": "[Mark Z.

{"Content": "[[, The backlash against the Obama administration prisoner exchange (five high-ranking Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo Bay for one American Army sergeant who has been shuttled between Afghanistan and Pakistan) appears to be unfolding on two fronts: the personal and the political., The personal attack is aimed at 28-year-old Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl by fellow soldiers who, free to speak now that Bergdahl has been released, say the soldier, who was then a private first class, voluntarily walked off his post in 2009, indirectly causing the deaths of at least six soldiers who tried to retrieve him., Bergdahl was a deserter and soldiers from his own unit died trying to track him down, writes Nathan Bradley Bethea, who served in the same battalion as Bergdahl and participated in some of those rescue efforts. Bergdahl should not, Bethea insists, be treated as a hero., That assault dovetails with the political assault against the prisoner swap that is picking up steam among conservatives, especially among Congressional Republicans. They say the Obama administration did not give Congress a required 30-day notice before transferring prisoners from Guantanamo Bay. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said Sunday on Meet the Press that the swap had to take place quickly, as Bergdahls safety and health were at risk., While politicians of both parties express joy and relief that Americans only known prisoner of war is coming home, Republicans insist the swap will only embolden terrorists and endanger American lives. House Republicans have already announced they will investigate., Republican Sen. John McCain, the only member of Congress to have been a prisoner of war, has been an especially harsh critic. On Sunday, on \"Face the Nation, the Arizona senator criticized the swap, describing the five Guantanamo prisoners as \"the hardest of the hard core\" and \"the highest high-risk people,\" warning that they could \"re-enter the fight.\", But McCains outrage is somewhat disingenuous. He has known for more than two years that the United States was negotiating a swap. (The freed prisoners are to live under some form of house arrest in Qatar for a year.), According to the late Michael Hastings, who wrote a long profile of Bergdahl for Rolling Stone in June 2012, administration officials had briefed a handful of senators, including McCain, on their efforts to trade five Taliban prisoners for Bergdahl in January 2012., McCain reluctantly came around on the prisoner exchange, according to those present at the meeting, wrote Hastings, but he has continued to speak out against negotiating with the Taliban. (The 2012 swap fell through, Hastings reported, after the Taliban balked at some of the conditions of the release.), Well be learning more about the circumstances of Bergdahls capture in the coming days and weeks. Clearly, there is confusion about how to think about him. The Drudge Report on Monday morning captured the ambivalence with a banner headline accompanying a photo of Bergdahl: Hero Deserter?, The Taliban, and Bergdahl, have an obvious interest in portraying his disappearance in Afghanistan as involuntary. In a 2009 video of Bergdahl released by the Taliban, the then-23-year-old soldier says I was lagging behind a patrol when I was captured., The Army, of course, has every interest in dispelling the idea that one of its own was kidnapped. Hastings described Bergdahls 2009 disappearance as voluntary flight by a soldier disillusioned with the American mission in Afghanistan, and the callous way he felt U.S. soldiers treated Afghani civilians., As Hastings wrote:, \"In the early morning hours of June 30, according to soldiers in the unit, Bowe approached his team leader not long after he got off guard duty and asked his superior a simple question: If I were to leave the base, would it cause problems if I took my sensitive equipment?, \"Yes, his team leader responded -- if you took your rifle and night-vision goggles, that would cause problems., \"Bowe returned to his barracks, a roughly built bunker of plywood and sandbags. He gathered up water, a knife, his digital camera and his diary. Then he slipped off the outpost.\", In his remarkably prescient piece, Hastings noted Bowes tour of duty \"mirrored\" the American experience in Afghanistan. Both, he wrote, were \"marked by tragedy, confusion, misplaced idealism, deluded thinking and, perhaps, a moment of insanity.

Four days later, he stood with Bergdahls parents at the White House to announced the swap., Republicans who predict that the release of the five Taliban prisoners will result in a \"Willie Horton moment\" for Obama ignore the fact that the president will never run for office again., As an election issue, Afghanistan will fade., Its hard to imagine the prisoner swap will have much of an impact on the upcoming Congressional mid-term elections, or even the presidential race in 2016. After all, Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state during most of Bergdahls captivity, was said to be wary of any prisoner swap. And since she has been out of office since February 2013, no one can blame her for it now., As for the personal attacks on Bergdahl, they should fade, too.

{"Content": "[[, The backlash over the Sodomite Suppression Act, the vicious anti-gay ballot initiative proposal, reached the ridiculous stage Wednesday when California Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris announced she would try to block it from the ballot., In a press release, she wrote that this proposal not only threatens public safety, it is patently unconstitutional, utterly reprehensible, and has no place in a civil society. Today, I am filing an action for declaratory relief with the court seeking judicial authorization for relief from the duty to prepare and issue the title and summary for the Sodomite Suppression Act., In so doing, Harris bestowed a level of gravity on a nutty proposal that would have otherwise probably died a quiet, ignoble death in some dark corner., We dont like the proposal any more than Harris does, and said so in an editorial this week urging her not to quash it. Not only does it appear that she doesnt have the authority to keep offensive proposals from voters, but it also just gives the idea and its creator, Huntington Beach attorney Matt McLaughlin, more power.

{"Content": "[[, The battle for control of the Senate wont conclude until November 2016, but decisions made this year in a few key states could go a long way toward deciding the outcome., In contests in which open seats can be won or a vulnerable incumbent toppled, this is the period when parties focus on a single issue: recruitment of candidates., Republicans are searching to find candidates in two states -- Colorado and Nevada -- where they have hopes of picking up Senate seats., Democrats lost control of the Senate during the last midterm election but have an edge in regaining control in 2016. Theyre set to defend 10 seats this time around compared with 24 for Republicans., Seven of those seats Republicans must defend are in states that President Obama won twice. In a presidential election year, in which turnout will be larger and include more minorities and young people, who often tilt Democratic, several of those races likely will be difficult for the GOP., To offset potential losses in blue states -- GOP incumbents in Illinois and Wisconsin are particularly vulnerable -- Republicans hope to pick up Democratic seats in Colorado, where they defeated incumbent Sen. Mark Udall in 2014, and  Nevada, where Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid will be retiring., But recruitment problems could limit those efforts., In Colorado, Rep. Mike Coffmans recent announcement that he will not challenge incumbent Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet has left Republicans scrambling., Coffman, who hails from a diverse suburban Denver district and has won statewide office in the past, is a strong fundraiser and is well known within the state party. Republicans now must consider several lower-profile and untested candidates to challenge Bennet., , COLORADO, Incumbent Sen. Michael Bennet (D) is seeking a second term., Coffman \"was the go-to candidate, now the party is left looking for a formidable contender on a thin list,\" said Eric Sondermann, a Denver-based political analyst., The list includes state Sen. Ellen Roberts, who represents a rural swath of southwestern Colorado, and Coffmans wife, Cynthia, the states attorney general. In 2014, Cynthia Coffman was the top GOP vote getter of any candidate in Colorado, but many of the states top strategists believe she will run for governor in 2018., Roberts could be a strong pick for a state thats never elected a woman senator, but her support of abortion rights will be a hurdle to overcome in a GOP primary., \"The big question is, can she make it out of a primary where there will certainly be really conservative candidates who hammer her on the issue,\" Sondermann said. , Roberts said that if she decides to run, the theme for her candidacy will resemble a slogan used by Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky: a \"different kind of Republican.\", \"We as a party need to find solutions and bring people together,\" Roberts said, describing herself as \"modestly libertarian.\", , NEVADA, The retirement of Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D) has left an open seat., In Nevada, where Reid has held his seat since 1987, Democrats have coalesced around his protg, former state Atty. Gen. Catherine Cortez Masto., Many Republicans had hoped that Gov. Brian Sandoval, who won reelection last year, would run for the seat. But Sandoval said this week he would not do so. Republican officials have been trying to persuade Rep. Joe Heck, a brigadier general, to enter the race although he has said that he would not run., Nathan L. Gonzales, editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report, said at this early stage \"its tough to judge recruitment classes.\", \"The party committees have the polling and, for the candidates they want, are charting a path,\" he said., , FLORIDA, As Sen. Marco Rubio (R) runs for president his seat becomes open., Florida Republicans will look to defend the seat of Sen. Marco Rubio as he seeks the Republican presidential nomination. The race, which is  ranked a \"pure tossup\" by the Political Report, is shaping up to have competitive primaries on both sides., Rep. Patrick Murphy represents a South Florida district and has been endorsed by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. The endorsement, however, hasnt deterred a likely challenge from Rep. Alan Grayson, who is notorious for making controversial comments., On the Republican side, state Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez Cantera, who is of Cuban and Jewish descent, is the favorite of establishment Republicans. Hes set to be challenged by tea-party favorite Rep. Ron DeSantis, whose district is in the northern part of the state. , \"I firmly believe -- firmly -- that a Floridian will be the Republican nominee for president,\" said Rick Wilson, a Florida GOP strategist, who is working for Cantera. In addition to Rubio, Floridas former governor Jeb Bush is seeking the nomination., \"That only helps the Republican Senate candidate in Florida, because it bumps up Republican turnout,\" Wilson said., , WISCONSIN, Incumbent Sen. Ron Johnson (R) is seeking a second term., In Wisconsin, the decision by former Sen. Russ Feingold to seek a rematch with Sen. Ron Johnson, who beat him in 2010, has created a race that both sides will watch closely.

{"Content": "[[, The board of the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange voted Tuesday night to overhaul its troubled healthcare website by adopting the smooth-running technology platform developed by Connecticut., Maryland has spent about $125.5 million operating and building its exchange, but in late February the state severed its $193-million contract with prime technology contractor Noridian Healthcare Solutions after struggling with technical problems that led to thousands of lost and stuck applications, as well as long wait times for frustrated consumers., Top state officials considered repairing thesystem at a cost of $66 million, according to a memo provided to the board, but believed the final product would still not provide a stable, sustainable system., They also ruled out a move to the federal exchange at an estimated cost of as much as $53 million, because they did not think the federal portal could adequately support their state plan., The partnership with Connecticut, top exchange officials said in the memo to board members, would allow Maryland to reuse existing software licenses as well as $8 million worth of hardware components. Exchange officials estimate the upgrade using the Connecticut technology platform will take about 6 months and cost about $40 million to $50 million., We have paid about $55 million to Noridian for development, hardware and software licenses, read the memo from Marylands health secretary, top information technology official and acting exchange director. The Maryland Health Benefit Exchange can seek to recoup these expenditures through litigation against our original contractors., Noridian could not be reached for comment Tuesday night., [Updated 8:58 p.m. April 1: In a statement released late Tuesday, Tom McGraw, Noridians president and chief executive, blamed state and federal officials for adding bells and whistles that caused many of the problems. Noridian acknowledges that many users had difficultly enrolling in health plans when the system went live on Oct. 1, 2013, and the company invested tremendous resources to remove those difficulties, he said.], In late December, the state brought on Optum/QSSI -- which also helped fix the federal portal, HealthCare.gov -- to help salvage the system before the end of open enrollment this week. The interimteam fixed many of the defects and tripled the number of workers who could assist by manually enrolling people through the call centers. But exchange officials said that major architectural changes would be needed to make the system sustainable, and in a memo to the board Monday they said the system remained deeply flawed., In a joint statement Tuesday night, Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley and his lieutenant governor said the website had been a source of great frustration for many Marylanders and that the vendors failed to build ... the platform they promised., In spite of the technical failures, OMalley and Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown said, state leaders had exceeded their goal by enrolling more than 295,000 people. That means a lot to these families who have the security and peace of mind that comes with having quality, affordable healthcare,\" they said. \"And it means a lot for the long-term affordability of our healthcare system.\", Both men face possible political repercussions from the troubled healthcare rollout. OMalley, a Democrat, is weighing a run for president in 2016 and Brown is running to succeed him as governor., Kevin Counihan, thehead of the Connecticut Exchange,said his staff had met with officials from five states to discuss the possibility of leasing out Connecticuts technology, but said they would only operate in concert with one state. Counihan attributed his states success to its effort to recruit people from the private sector who were used to a lot of pressure, irrational time frames and a lack of resources, and were willing to say no when vendors offered complex features., The adult in the room, ironically, has to be the client sometimes, Counihan said in an interview last week, explaining how Connecticut slashed the scope of the technology its exchange had originally planned. We really wanted to focus on doing fewer things consistently well., Maryland is facing an investigation by the federal Health and Human Services Departments inspector general, who confirmed in a letter to federal lawmakers Tuesday that his office planned to look at whether Maryland complied with federal requirements when it developed and launched its health insurance exchange., In the letter to Rep.

{"Content": "[[, The case that comes before the Supreme Court on Wednesday with the potential to unravel President Obamas landmark healthcare law began in a conference room at the American Enterprise Institute, a few blocks from the White House and the K Street corridor., It was December 2010, and voters had recently elected a new crop of Republicans, many of whom had ridden to victory on their objections to Obamacare. GOP attorneys general in several states, along with a major business group, had headed to court in Florida, arguing the entire law was unconstitutional., With the counterattack gaining strength, conservative lawyers and activists gathered at AEI, a conservative think tank, to look for flaws in the massive Affordable Care Act and to devise a legal strategy for destroying it., \"This bastard has to be killed as a matter of political hygiene,\" Michael Greve, an AEI scholar, declared. \"I dont care how this is done, whether its dismembered, whether we drive a stake through its heart. Any dollar spent on that goal is worth spending.\", Those remarks got the most attention at the time. But the comments that may turn out to have been the most important came from a soft-spoken former Reagan administration lawyer who had closely studied the 900-page law. Thomas Christina said he had \"noticed something peculiar in the tax-credit section.\", A key part of the law is the creation of exchanges  online marketplaces where consumers can buy insurance and receive subsidies to help with the cost. California and 12 other states run their own marketplaces; the rest rely on the federal government fully or partially for their marketplace., The exchanges are crucial to the laws success, but one provision, Christina said, seemed to him to say that \"there will be no tax credits for taxpayers who live in non-capitulating states,\" as he called the states that decided not to set up their own exchanges., That \"is really quite extraordinary,\" he said., So began the case now known as King vs. Burwell, a legal challenge that argues the healthcare law denies tax subsidies for about 7 million Americans who live in the states that use the federal HealthCare.gov marketplace, rather than setting up their own exchange., The path the case has followed  from a conference room at a Washington think tank to a nearby federal courthouse to the Supreme Court  illustrates one way that high-profile litigation can land in front of the justices. Its course forms a sharp contrast with the same-sex marriage cases the court is scheduled to hear next month., In those latter cases, beginning first in New England and then across the country, gay and lesbian couples came forward in one state after another seeking a right to marry. Slowly over a decade, their legal claims rose toward the high court. Although legal advocacy groups were involved in selecting cases to push, no one denies that the individual plaintiffs came first., By contrast, in the healthcare case, the lawyers spotted a possible flaw in the statute and then sought out a few plaintiffs whose names could carry a lawsuit. The litigation has moved rapidly, but questions about whether the plaintiffs meet the legal standards to be in court could still upend the case., The law says taxpayers must have health insurance, and it offers subsidies to those with low and moderate incomes. But as Christina noted, the section on tax credits says these subsidies will be provided through an \"exchange established by the state.\", The Obama administration argues that the federal exchanges serve in place of the state exchanges. But those who have challenged the law disagree, and if the justices side with them, the ruling would deal the law a severe blow., Conservatives were disappointed in June 2012 when Chief Justice John G. Roberts, speaking for a 5-4 majority, said the requirement that individuals have insurance could be enforced through a tax penalty., But the laws opponents were not about to give up., \"We got to talking after the Supreme Court upheld Obamacare and looked seriously into whether a case could be structured based on Tom Christinas discovery,\" said Sam Kazman, general counsel for the Competitive Enterprise Institute., His small libertarian group, like nearby AEI, champions free-market principles, but unlike the think tank, it also files lawsuits. It has about 30 employees and a budget of $6 million, the sources of which are unpublicized. \"We dont disclose our donors,\" Kazman said., Kazmans group decided to fund a challenge to the tax subsidies. The group hired Michael Carvin, a conservative and Reagan-era veteran who had led the challenge to the law in 2012. They filed suit close to home, first in the District of Columbia and later in nearby Virginia., They found several people who objected to the healthcare law and were willing to act as plaintiffs. One was David Klemencic, who said he ran a flooring business in West Virginia and expected to earn $20,000 a year. He said he did not wish to buy health insurance, even if the subsidy reduced the cost to \"less than $21 a year,\" according to the U.S. court of appeals in Washington., Citing that potential injury to Klemencic, the appeals court here, by a 2-1 vote, said the legal challenge could go forward. On July 22, it ruled that the tax subsidies were illegal in states that had not set up their own exchanges., A few hours later, the U.S. appeals court in Richmond, Va., came to the opposite conclusion. Kazmans group had sued there on behalf of David King, a publicity-shy 64-year-old who had served in the Army in Vietnam and also said he objected to being required to buy health insurance even if it was highly subsidized., The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for the Obama administration, saying the law made tax subsidies available nationwide., Because King is a military veteran and may be eligible for veterans healthcare, the Wall Street Journal and other news outlets have raised questions about whether he is covered by the requirement to buy insurance. If not, he might lack the legal status, known as standing, necessary to pursue a case. Similar questions have been raised about the other plaintiffs., So far, however, that has not proved an impediment. On Nov. 7, the justices announced they would hear King vs. Burwell.

{"Content": "[[, The charade comes to an end this month for many of the 2016 presidential contenders, who have long avoided saying they are running  while they are so obviously running  in order to sidestep rules that burden declared candidates., Ted Cruz is already in. Rand Paul is expected to follow suit Tuesday. Marco Rubio has a big announcement planned a week later., The timing, like most things in politics, is driven by money. April marks the start of a sprint to raise as much of it as possible for an official candidacy before the summer reporting deadline, which lands as televised primary debates are about to get underway. Candidates who fail to show that the early big money is flowing into campaign accounts could quickly falter., One big exception is Jeb Bush., Although he is perhaps the least coy of the pre-candidates about his plans to run  and among the most aggressive fundraisers  his announcement may not come for a while., Because of his support from big donors and the fact that he holds no federal office  unlike Cruz, Paul and Rubio, all Republican senators  the former Florida governor is ideally positioned to take advantage of massive holes that have been poked in campaign finance laws in recent years., So long as he doesnt say the magic words \"Im running,\" Bush contends that he can raise and spend unlimited sums through a so-called super PAC under his control., His ability to do so reflects the extent to which long-existing federal constraints on raising political cash that had eroded badly by 2012 have melted away. Though super PACs are supposed to operate independently of candidates, even that prohibition on the groups activities disappears because Bush has not explicitly announced he is running for president., Instead of assembling an official campaign apparatus, Bush is trailblazing into a new frontier of super PACs. It is a place off-limits to most of his GOP competitors, who are inhibited by conflict-of-interest rules that limit how much money senators and congressmen can solicit and from whom., \"This is entirely new ground,\" said Paul Ryan, senior counsel with the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center. \"No candidate or prospective candidate has ever done this before. The boundaries are getting pushed further and further.\", The super PACs that emerged in 2012 were themselves new territory. Candidates went to great lengths to avoid the appearance of any influence over them., They were run independently. Contenders certainly did not show up at the super PAC fundraising events where donors were encouraged to disregard the caps that held back how much they could give to official campaign accounts and open their wallets with abandon., Such discretion was nowhere to be found in Bushs fundraising swing through California in recent days. Bush himself headlined the events. He was the big draw on invitations that asked donors to give as much as $100,000 to attend., Bush did declare he would impose a total cap on how much each donor could contribute, according to the Washington Post. But it wasnt the $5,000 maximum that those in the race are limited to asking for by law. It was $1 million., While Bush is moving into uncharted territory, he is also following a family tradition. Both his father, former President George H.W. Bush, and brother, former President George W. Bush, built their primary victories around robust early fundraising., \"It is one of the things we have seen in past Bush candidacies,\" said Anthony Corrado, a professor of government at Colby College in Maine. \"They took a lead in fundraising early on to establish their position in the race. Jeb Bush is now going to do that through this super PAC. This will be seen as campaign money.\", The other star pre-candidate positioned to vacuum up so much cash, so quickly, is Hillary Rodham Clinton. Like Bush, she is unencumbered by a government job and the fundraising restrictions it brings., Clinton, though, is on a different timetable from the Republicans. The Democratic primaries are shaping up to be a mere formality for her, with no serious opposition. She has yet to start fundraising aggressively., If Clinton launches her campaign this month, the move will not be driven by money. Clinton does not need to prove big donors support her. She needs to preserve her popularity, and she is under pressure to have a clearly organized, disciplined campaign staff to respond to the growing mob of reporters scrutinizing her every move., But other non-declared contenders are pursuing strategies similar to Bushs. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie recently got his super PAC underway. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania launched nonprofits that are unrestricted by federal caps and also cloak the identities of donors., But Santorum lacks Bushs donor base, and Walker and Christie may find themselves held back by prohibitions against sitting governors raising money from donors who do business with their states., The fundraising \"innovations,\" as they are called by the lawyers who concoct them, could ultimately be found to be illegal. Yet none of the pre-candidates seems particularly worried., Regulators overseeing campaign finance at the Federal Election Commission who might like to rein in the donations lack the needed support from its board. Experts say gridlock among the appointees at the agency has left the boundaries of what is permissible so vague that campaign lawyers are emboldened to make up their own rules., \"The system has become so porous that you can just push the envelope further and further,\" said Richard Hasen, a law professor at UC Irvine. \"The FEC is not enforcing the law. Its created these gray areas where campaigns can do these things and not get into trouble.\", On Thursday, the Campaign Legal Center filed complaints at the commission against Bush and three other pre-candidates arguing, in essence, that nobody could possibly believe they are anything but candidates, or at least testing the waters of candidacy  and they are breaking the law by ignoring limits on donations., Even in the unlikely event the FEC finds that the law was broken, nobody expects anything to change in this race, least of all the watchdogs who filed the complaint., \"Even if they investigate and find the law was violated, any such conclusion wouldnt come for a year or two or three from now,\" Ryan said., Meanwhile, he expects the latest fundraising loopholes to trickle down to other races, just as the ones that emerged in the 2012 presidential election ultimately did., \"If Jeb Bush gets away with bankrolling a $100-million shadow campaign, that becomes the new normal,\" he said. \"Every major House and Senate candidate will start postponing their campaign launch, setting up a super PAC, ignoring fundraising limits as long as they can, and then at the last minute they will file their paperwork to run.\", evan.halper@latimes.com, Twitter: @evanhalper]", "Date": "20150406", "Title": "[Presidential candidates-to-be make the most of fundraising rule-bending]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-campaign-cash-20150406-story.html", "Author": "[Evan Halper]"}
{"Content": "[[, The commissioner was adamant. She urged a drastic change in Los Angeles County budget priorities and reorganizing county government to better serve abused and neglected children., The entire task force is really insisting that childrens services be given the highest priority in the county budget, she said, and that means on a level with other protective services like the Police Department. Our children deserve no less than that kind of priority., The words could easily have come from the transcript of the April 22 presentation to the Board of Supervisors of the final report of the Blue Ribbon Commission on Child Protection, which is calling for a new office to transcend departmental lines to bring services to children at risk of abuse or neglect. They could have. But they didnt., They were delivered on a different April morning  30 years ago, as part of a series of hearings on a proposal to create a new county department of childrens services. The speaker was Celeste Strack Kaplan, a faculty member of the USC School of Social Work and president of the Los Angeles Round Table for Children, which led the fight to create the department. Other experts testified in those 1984 hearings, as did a host of celebrities. TVs Henry Winkler noted that everyone else had their own department  there was even a department for trees, he said  but not children., The testimony of Kaplan, Winkler and others was depicted as part of The Passions & Politics of Ed Edelman, a 2013 film about the county supervisor who served from 1974 to 1994. The film, by Edelmans wife, Mari, is celebratory, enlightening and, to be honest, somewhat depressing., Why depressing? Because in highlighting the difficult and heroic actions that Edelman took to improve the lives of thousands of people, its a stinging reminder that some problems seem to remain exactly where they were decades ago., Consider, for example, the resistance of a combative sheriff  in this case, Sherman Block to the notion that there was anything at all wrong in his department, Edelmans role in creating a commission under Judge James Kolts to ferret out problems and recommend an oversight structure, and the creation of a new Office of Independent Review to provide a measure of civilian oversight., The film features a television reporters summary of the Kolts Commissions findings: Disturbing evidence of excessive force and lax discipline., Thats a line that could easily apply to the 2012 report of the Citizens Commission on Jail Violence. Despite the Kolts Commission, the Sheriffs Department spun out of control. Although separated by 20 years, the two commissions found many of the same problems, many recommendations from the earlier report unimplemented, and others  like the Office of Independent review  inadequate to the task. The OIR is now being phased out, at least as an oversight body for the sheriff., And, of course, there is the task force consisting of Kaplan and others that compelled the Board of Supervisors to remove oversight of abused and neglected children from the countys welfare department and to create what is now the Department of Children and Family Services. DCFS has burned through, on average, one director every year and a half, leaving unstable leadership and constantly shifting policies and priorities. The department has been roundly criticized for the quality of its service to children and to their families. This years Blue Ribbon Commission is calling for deep, systemic change., So its easy to walk away exasperated and conclude that problems with jail beatings, child services and other areas in which county government intersects with human misery are with us always, like poverty, and that it is pointless wheel-spinning to try to do much about them., That certainly would be a lesson. But its the wrong lesson. To see why, its helpful to return to the Edelman film, to be reminded of all of the things this county supervisor did accomplish in his 20 years on the board from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s and his decade before that on the L.A. City Council. His work on homelessness, mental illness, AIDS, creating a new childrens court  all of it made peoples lives better., Of course the county still flounders with homelessness, mental illness and other problems. Government cant simply put in place a structure  for example, a Department of Children and Family Services  and expect that service will improve forever or problems will evaporate without constant attention, organizational maintenance, monitoring of progress and tracking of changing conditions in society. A lot can happen, good and bad, in three decades., The trick is to put in place structures and programs that are sound, and to correct the kinks over time. And every now and then it may be time for a revamp, or at least a reevaluation of programs put in place to solve the problems of previous decades. With the June 3 county elections and the looming replacement of two county supervisors  the most sweeping change on the board since 1980, and with two more changes to come in 2016  could there be a better time than now for such a revamp?]", "Date": "20140505", "Title": "[A 30-year time warp for L.A.

{"Content": "[[, The contours of Californias U.S. Senate race sharpened Saturday, with Kamala Harris trying to keep stride as the leading contender while upstart Loretta Sanchez sought to knock her off balance., Their clashing ambitions dominated an Anaheim gathering of several thousand Democrats pondering who was best suited to capture the Senate seat that Barbara Boxer has occupied for more than 22 years., Harris, the state attorney general, outlined a broad federal agenda for the first time since entering the race in January. Highlights included a \"full pathway to citizenship\" for immigrants in the country illegally, a rise in the minimum wage and an end to the federal ban on medical marijuana., Speaking two days after Sanchez announced she was running, Harris referred only obliquely to the Orange County congresswoman, implying that her rivals 18 years in the House of Representatives should be no source of pride., \"I believe we can disrupt the dysfunction in D.C.,\" Harris told the convention delegates in a speech punctuated by tributes to such civil rights leaders as United Farm Workers icon Cesar Chavez and Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall., California Senate candidates have until next March to decide whether to run in the June 2016 primary, so the Democratic field could expand., Rep. Xavier Becerra of Los Angeles, another possible contender who was working the convention, said he expects to decide by August whether to get in., Meanwhile, Sanchez leaped Saturday at the chance to attack Harris for a lack of legislative experience, saying she doesnt know \"how to get things done in Washington.\", \"She has no foreign-relations, military, homeland security experience,\" Sanchez told reporters., The annual party convention put Sanchezs feisty personality and freewheeling campaign style on vivid display, a counterpoint to her opponents more measured and risk-averse approach., \"So you get a little flavor of who I am, were having margaritas and mambo at 4 p.m.,\" Sanchez told the partys rural caucus with a sly grin. \"Come on by.\", On a visit to an assembly of Filipino Americans, Sanchez mentioned her affinity for ballroom dancing, especially the fox trot, then bemoaned rebel insurgencies in the Philippines., She stumbled, however, in telling the Indian American caucus about an occasion when she confused a Native American with an Indian American. Video shot by a convention delegate and circulated on Twitter showed Sanchez tapping her hand to her mouth in an imitation of a \"war cry.\", When Harris was asked about the remark, her eyebrows rose., \"I dont know what to say to that,\" said Harris, whose mother was an immigrant from India. \"That  that  thats shocking,\" Harris said. She repeated: \"Thats shocking.\", At Sanchezs \"mambos and margaritas\" event, the festive mood was undercut when Sanchez was asked if the gesture was appropriate., \"Well, I think Native Americans have an incredibly great history, and a great presence in our country, and many of them are supporting our election,\" she said., Harris threw her own party, a more staid \"Cookies with Kamala\" gathering, with no mambo., Earlier, Sanchez had weighed in on more serious events, telling reporters outside the convention hall that Congress would approve President Obamas proposed nuclear deal with Iran if the final terms are acceptable., \"As you know probably, my specialty in the Congress is nuclear proliferation and nonproliferation,\" she said. \"Ive been sitting in that Situation Room in the White House dealing with this issue for a while now.\", She dashed over to a line of several dozen carpenters in orange vests protesting Obamas proposed \"fast-track\" authority to negotiate a Pacific trade pact. Walking the line in heels, she high-fived the construction workers one by one and led a chant: \"No fast track!\", It was a popular stand among delegates. They roundly applauded lunchtime speaker Elizabeth Warren when the Massachusetts senator said Obamas planned Trans-Pacific Partnership would benefit multinational corporations and \"leave American workers in the dirt.\", Warrens presence was a reminder of the advantages that Harris has against Sanchez and other potential rivals. Warren and two other senators, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Cory Booker of New Jersey, are helping Harris raise money, as are a large cadre of Hollywood executives., Warren used the convention platform to tout Harris role in a national mortgage-fraud settlement., \"We were in the trenches together, and the big banks were fighting us tooth and nail,\" Warren said. \"That woman was fearless.\", In her own remarks to delegates, Harris drew attention to her offices high-profile lawsuit against the for-profit Corinthian Colleges, saying that \"diploma mills\" can saddle unwitting students with \"useless degrees and a lifetime of debt.\", She also denounced \"mass incarceration,\" describing the \"war on drugs\" as a failure, and vowed to fight economic inequities., \"The same way we know marriage equality is a civil right, we know income inequality is a civil wrong,\" she said. Later, she told reporters she would support repeal of the federal death penalty., Sanchez, who voted against the Iraq war, struck no policy contrasts with Harris. On a visit to the state partys LGBT caucus, she described herself as the first member of Congress to meet with transgender advocates., \"We have been in the forefront in the Congress working on everybodys rights  especially the LGBT community,\" she said., And at the environmental caucus, Sanchez recalled fighting in the 1990s to limit environmental harm caused by construction of the Highway 73 toll road in Orange County., michael.finnegan@latimes.com, peter.jamison@latimes.com, Twitter: @finneganLAT, @petejamison]", "Date": "20150516", "Title": "[Harris, Sanchez dominate Anaheim gathering of California Democrats]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/orangecounty/la-me-pol-california-democrats-20150517-story.html", "Author": "[Michael Finnegan, Peter Jamison]"}
{"Content": "[[, The costliest midterm election in history draws to a bitter close with control of the Senate tilting toward Republicans even as governors, in red and blue states alike, face a well of anti-incumbent anger from New England to the Rocky Mountains., Growing GOP momentum has strengthened Republican challengers in tight Senate races  including Alaska, Colorado and Iowa  and bolstered the prospect of expanding the partys House majority, as the number of competitive contests pushes deeper into Democratic-held territory, including Las Vegas and California., But unlike a conventional wave election that swamps members of a single party, Tuesdays results could bring a more mixed showing, as Republicans fight to protect Senate seats in the strongholds of Kansas, Georgia and Kentucky and governorships in several states, including Maine, Georgia, Florida and Wisconsin., For their part, Democrats are battling to keep the governors office in the blue bastions of Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts and here in Colorado, where John Hickenlooper easily won four years ago., Burdened by association with the deeply unpopular President Obama, Democrats have seen little political benefit from the steadily growing economy, which, for many voters, has failed to translate into a sense of greater well-being., \"Theres just a lot of folks, they can see that the economys coming back,\" Hickenlooper said in an interview at an office near the Capitol, where he ate chicken soup to fight a cold. \"But theyre not believers yet.\", In many ways, Colorado has become the epicenter of this midterm election, which will hit about $4 billion in spending and feature  if that is the word  well over 2 million TV advertisements, most of them negative. The Denver area has seen more of those commercials than anywhere else in the country: upward of 78,000 this year through mid-October, and counting., The Internet offers no respite, as websites and even streaming music services are filled with advertisements deploring the voting record of Rep. Cory Gardner, the GOP Senate nominee, or condemning Democratic Sen. Mark Udalls fealty to Obama., Adding to the onslaught has been a seemingly endless barrage of bad news  about Ebola, Russian hegemony, hostages beheaded in the Middle East  and a series of Washington missteps, including the botched rollout of the healthcare program and scandals at the Internal Revenue Service, the Secret Service and the Department of Veterans Affairs., The result is a surly electorate, and it goes beyond Colorado. Those not skipping the election in disgust are ready to lash out at lawmakers of both parties., \"I dont like any of the campaigns anymore,\" said Frank Riehl, a retired farmer in Iowa City, Iowa, another state inundated with a flood of scathing TV ads. Hell vote Tuesday for Democratic hopeful Bruce Braley in his white-hot Senate race with Republican Joni Ernst, but only out of a sense of civic duty., In House races across the country, the only thing that prevents significant turnover is the drawing of political lines that purposely limit competition and make it extremely difficult to oust most members. Only about three dozen seats out of 435 have the prospect of changing partisan hands after Tuesday., There will be much greater turnover in the 100-member Senate, with most of the new faces likely belonging to Republicans. The GOP needs to gain six seats to win control and the party seems halfway there, with near-certain victories in Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia., Elsewhere, the party has been on the offensive throughout this election year, as most competitive races are in states that Obama lost in 2012, including Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana and, narrowly, North Carolina., In all, more than half a dozen Senate races remain too close to call, with history suggesting most will break Tuesday in favor of one party or the other., For Republicans, this election year has been driven by a single overarching message, which can be easily distilled: it is anti-Obama., For their part, Democrats have largely shunned the president, or at least his presence on stage or in their TV advertising, while insisting his policies have worked better than voters might think., Appearing alongside Udall last week at a roadside cafe outside Colorado Springs, the states junior senator, Democrat Michael Bennet, ticked off a litany of upbeat economic statistics: consecutive months of job growth, falling unemployment, a rejuvenated auto industry. After each, Bennet, the head of the partys Senate campaign committee, exclaimed, \"People forget that!\", \"We need to remind people of what really has happened,\" he told about 50 fleece-wrapped party faithful, who clapped and nodded., The rest of the Democratic message includes familiar standbys: accusations that Republicans want to gut Medicare and Social Security, a dose of economic populism  including calls for a higher minimum wage  and a renewal of the \"war on women\" attacks that helped Obama win reelection two years ago., Udall has been especially vociferous in assailing Gardner for his antiabortion stance, so much that he acquired the mocking nickname \"Mark Uterus\" and lost the endorsement of the Denver Post, which condemned his \"obnoxious one-issue campaign.\", The countrys gubernatorial races are, for the most part, being waged on issues more closely tailored to local concerns. In Connecticut, its tax hikes and slow economic growth under Democratic Gov. Dan Malloy. In Kansas, its tax cuts, under Republican Gov. Sam Brownback, which have imperiled education funding and hurt the states bond rating., Here in Colorado, Hickenlooper faces a backlash over new gun laws, his decision to grant a limited reprieve to a death row inmate and a reputation for vacillation., \"I wouldnt pretend that youre always going to agree with me,\" former Rep. Bob Beauprez, the GOP gubernatorial nominee, told a crowd last week outside Republican headquarters in Colorado Springs. \"There will probably be times when we have differences. But I can guarantee you one thing: I can make a decision and I will make decisions.\", Among the 150 or so cheering him on was Sharon Thompson, a city councilwoman from next-door Fountain. She stood in the headquarters parking lot, staring into the late-afternoon sun, for nearly two hours as well over half a dozen candidates worked their way through stock speeches., But even a party soldier like Thompson has her limits and, like many in this politically saturated state, she has adopted a strategy for her TV viewing. Around March, she said, she began taping \"19 Kids and Counting\" and the home-improvement shows she enjoys, so she can skip over the incessant campaign advertising from both sides., \"I was just watching a show last night when I thought, Gosh, next week I wont have to worry about this,\" Thompson said. She paused. \"But then they start the Christmas ads.\", mark.barabak@latimes.com, Twitter: @markzbarabak, Times staff writer Maeve Reston in Iowa City, Iowa, contributed to this report.]", "Date": "20141103", "Title": "[Midterm election rides wave of anger at incumbents]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-election-overview-20141103-story.html", "Author": "[Mark Z.

{"Content": "[[, The cowboy commissioner arrives late, barging into the night meeting like one of his prized rodeo bulls broken loose from its pen., His Clark County Commission staff has collected residents of this ranching community to hash out a disputed federal land-use plan. Yet Tom Collins doesnt join officials up front in the meeting hall. Clad in worn Wrangler jeans and a plaid western shirt, his black Stetson tilted back on his head, he eases his lumbering 6-foot-3, 250-pound frame onto a creaking folding chair in the back row., He takes his hat off his gray, balding head and sets it on the floor, and he leans back like a wise-cracking high school senior. He digs into a Big Mac and fries amid the smell of grease and burger., \"I havent eaten since breakfast,\" he explains in a rough rural twang, wiping his fingers on his jeans., The performance is vintage Collins. At age 64, the lifelong rodeo man continued to ride bulls until a few years ago and remains popular among voters who have religiously returned him to office  including five terms in the Legislature  despite personal peccadilloes that might have dynamited other political careers., For one, Collins likes to drink whiskey; his poison-of-choice is Pendleton, a Canadian blend. The one-time Mormon convert who later left the church has unapologetically professed to keep a bottle on his office desk, by his bed and by the TV., There have been alcohol-fueled mishaps, like being cited for excessive noise for shooting up a tree at his North Las Vegas home during a drunken 2012 holiday celebration. (Collins, who paid a fine, said he was mad at the tree. Voters reelected him four months later.), Tom Collins, some scoff: Even his name is a drink., To grasp Collins unflagging popularity is to understand politics in a state that has featured cocktail-swilling Las Vegas mayor and mob lawyer Oscar Goodman  a place where personal foibles and cheesy flamboyance are tolerated and even embraced, as long as a candidate delivers., Collins knows that all too well. At the night meeting, he playfully pokes a Boy Scout in the row ahead, giving a thumbs-up to the youths uniform. Like President Lyndon Johnson, he leans imposingly into a group of men, invading their space, telling a private joke that makes everyone laugh., He presses a wad of Copenhagen chewing tobacco into his mouth and fiddles with a smartphone video of his bellowing cattle. A staffer shoots him the slashed-throat sign to take it outside. He picks at his nails, sighing audibly at comments that displease him. A local activist and Collins critic asks if he can have the crowds attention. \"No,\" the commissioner says to himself. \"Shut up. Sit down.\", Then Collins limps to the microphone; his body battered by countless falls from angry bulls. He thanks people for their views and pledges to continue as their bridge with federal officials: \"Happy New Year. I love you all.\" He knows such feelings arent always mutual., \"People out here either love me or hate me,\" he says later. \"I can handle both.\", Collins comes from country roots. Raised in Las Vegas, he rode a horse named Dogger Red to school as a boy. Decades later, the gruff political maverick insists hes not a politician, but an elected official who gets the job done: After flash floods, Collins has distributed hay from his pickup to feed stray cattle and used his own tractor to clear debris., As a legislator, he intervened when officials refused to let residents use a county fair agricultural arena during off months. Collins snipped the lock with bolt cutters. Taxpayers had financed the building, he said; it was theirs to use., \"Tom steps on toes,\" said Glen Hardy, an 83-year-old rancher. \"If youre not a Democrat, youre not worth a crap  hell tell you right to your face.\", His public emails frequently launch the F-bomb; he leans over a trash-can-turned-spittoon at commission meetings, where he often addresses public speakers as \"Bubba\" and \"darling.\" Commissioners once sought to ban him from the seven-member board over his public behavior. (They cant; only voters can.), Last year, the board chastised Collins after offensive remarks in which he called Utah residents \"a bunch of inbred bastards.\" Collins admitted to battling some \"personal demons,\" including a divorce from his longtime wife, Kathy. But he did not apologize., \"He has such thick skin, he doesnt realize his words can be hurtful,\" said Clark County Commission Chairman Steve Sisolak. \"This is a government body. Were not out on the range.\", Collins says hes accountable only to his constituents: \"I have won elections by a landslide because Im honest and Ill tell you what I think. And if I tell you Im going to do something, you can take that to the bank.\", At home, he often watches the Western Channel, shows like \"Bat Masterson\" and \"Maverick.\" He espouses \"cowboy logic\" and his cellphone message tells callers to \"cowboy up.\" He tweets under the handle @CowboyCommish. And his diesel pickup  its vanity plate carrying his cattle brand, \"T Bar K\"  is such a behemoth he struggles to fit it into his county parking space., He says his guiding ethos comes from John Wayne in the 1976 movie \"The Shootist\": \"I wont be wronged; I wont be insulted; I wont be laid a hand on.\", He briefly attended Midwestern University in Texas on a rodeo scholarship and is an inductee in the National Senior Pro Rodeo Assn. Hall of Fame. He rode bulls until a bad fall five years ago and says he may yet ride them again. He has a house in North Las Vegas and a 40-acre spread farther north with 30 rodeo-stock cattle., Collins did construction and worked for a power company until he first ran for public office in the early 1990s, concerned over \"do nothing\" government., Campaigning as a \"union Democrat\" whos conservative on social issues, he was elected to the North Las Vegas City Council and then the Legislature, often capturing 60% of the vote. In 2004, he began his first term as a county commissioner. Hes termed out in 2016., The cowboy commissioner has also used social media to blast fellow officials. Last year, Darin Bushman, an official in Piute County, Utah, called Collins about a ranch issue. Thats when Collins made the \"inbred bastards\" remark. The comment floored Bushman: \"Im like, Really dude? Youre a public official?\", Collins says his sarcasm is misunderstood. When reminded of the Bushman fray, he smiles. \"That inbred bastard? Hes related to half the people in Piute County.\", But Collins can be contrite. At a meeting after his insults to Bushman, he dropped his bravado. \"Ive been in a downward spiral for a couple of years, I admit it. Ive done some rude things and some not pleasant things, and real friends come and talk to me,\" he said. \"A lot of it is when theres sarcasm or trying to turn pain to humor.\", Through it all, Collins remains a drinker; no excuses. He often boozes out of anger over politics and his personal life, including personal debt and estrangement from his two children and his eight grandkids., Recently, at a North Las Vegas watering hole, a staffer plays designated driver. Collins orders a bottle of Coors Light  his first of four  saying hes loyal to Coors and Pendleton for sponsoring rodeo shows. He spits tobacco juice into a Styrofoam cup, addressing his critics with the F-bomb, a salvo he fires often., He calls himself \"a binge drinker\" rather than alcoholic, saying he doesnt booze as often as people think. He admits hes come to public meetings with a buzz. But again, no apologies: \"Even drunk, I can do more by accident than many people can do on purpose.\" When his commission term ends, he may run for city council. Or governor., His close friends have forgiven his reckless behavior. Decades ago, Collins was out drinking when his truck struck a parked tractor-trailer. He was injured, but his passenger, local pig farmer Bob Combs, suffered serious head injuries that still slur his speech., \"I held Bobs head to keep him from bleeding,\" Collins recalls. \"That accident taught us something: that were both mortal.\", As Collins battles his demons, Combs still calls him a brother. So does Combs wife, Janet. \"I love Tom; he stands his ground,\" she said. \"All in all, hes a pretty darned good man. A mans man.\", ALSO:, A big Las Vegas kaboom with hotel-casino implosion, His home museum of oddities is weird even for Vegas, Utah uranium mine is more of a bad memory than a historic site for many, ]", "Date": "20150301", "Title": "[In Nevada, cowboy commissioner rides a career as a political maverick ]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-tom-collins-20150301-story.html", "Author": "[John M.

{"Content": "[[, The crisis in Iraq and broader unrest in the Middle East have exposed a growing rift among Republicans on foreign policy, as skeptics of military intervention have more openly challenged the partys hawkish posture in the post-Sept. 11 era., Unfolding events in the region could help shape the fight for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 just as it did for Democrats in 2008, when Barack Obama capitalized on liberals distaste for the war in Iraq as he wrested the nomination from front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton., Even as Americans take an increasingly dim view of President Obamas handling of foreign policy, however, they have generally supported his positions on the Middle East. Their disapproval of his leadership style rather than his policies has further complicated Republican divisions., Few Republicans in Congress have been willing to outline specific approaches to confront challenges in Iraq and elsewhere. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), who has accused the president of \"taking a nap\" as Islamic State forces gained strength in Syria and Iraq, has nonetheless resisted questions about specific steps the U.S. should take going forward., Those who have spoken out dont always agree, and their debate joins similar internal Republican spats over immigration reform and spending as issues likely to vex the party heading into 2016., Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a likely presidential candidate, is a leading voice challenging hawkish colleagues who see recent developments in Iraq as a result of the Obama administrations efforts to wind down overseas conflicts. In a recent \"Meet the Press\" interview, he said some of the blame lay with his fellow Republicans who supported the U.S. wars during George W. Bushs tenure., \"Whats going on now I dont blame on President Obama,\" he said. \"Has he really got the solution? Maybe there is no solution. But I do blame the Iraq war on the chaos that is in the Middle East. I also blame those who are for the Iraq war for emboldening Iran.\", Pauls views put him in direct opposition with lawmakers such as Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who had consistently advocated that the U.S. maintain a military presence in Iraq, and now say their warnings have been proven correct., \"I predicted this fully and completely and did it time after time after time,\" McCain said last month., Though McCain has not called for sending in new ground forces, he has been one of the few in his party to publicly call for a more forceful military role, including arming Syrian rebels and conducting airstrikes in Iraq. He says many Republicans support his philosophy., \"I talk with them constantly; they understand what Sen. Graham and I are pushing,\" he said, while acknowledging that Paul is a notable exception. \"Most of them that I can see agree.\", McCain was a forceful proponent of the U.S. military \"surge\" in Iraq as he ran for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination. But few potential 2016 hopefuls have gone beyond making broad statements about the importance of projecting strength in the face of terrorist threats., \"Some of the presidential contenders, this is their moment,\" said Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), a major in the Air National Guard who flew missions in Iraq and Afghanistan and supports airstrikes against Islamic State forces, formerly known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. \"Im not expecting everybody to take a hard position because some people, its just not in their wheelhouse. But I think that the people that are putting themselves up to lead the free world really need to take a position either way. Stand on it.\", The latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed that Americans view of Obama on foreign policy was at an all-time low, with just 37% approving. Among respondents who said the Obama administrations overall performance had worsened in the last year, foreign policy and the Bowe Bergdahl/Taliban prisoner exchange were among the leading reasons cited., But Republicans may find it hard to take advantage of Obamas woes without a unified foreign policy approach of their own., \"You havent seen a rallying of the public to the Republican alternative on foreign policy because its not obvious what the Republican alternative is,\" said Christopher Preble, a defense policy analyst for the Cato Institute., At an event last year where he offered his most extensive comments on foreign policy since becoming a senator, Texas Republican Ted Cruz was asked where he fit on the spectrum of Republican views on foreign policy, with Paul at one end and McCain at the other., \"I consider myself somewhere in between those two poles,\" he said., Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, another potential presidential candidate in 2016, has aligned with more hawkish elements of his party. His speech this year at the Conservative Political Action Conference, a major gathering of party activists, called for strong American engagement in the face of threats posed by totalitarian states such as North Korea, China and Russia., \"We do not have the luxury of seeing the world the way we hope it would be. We have to see the world the way it is. And we must address these issues before they grow unmanageable,\" he said., Rubio last week called Obamas decision to send 300 advisors to Iraq \"a good first step,\" but said U.S. involvement should ultimately include airstrikes targeting Islamic State leaders and supply lines used to transfer weapons. He also called for arming moderate Syrian rebels and further \"counter-terrorism measures\" in Syria as part of a broader strategy to promote regional stability., The potential Republican fault line over Iraq has lured former Vice President Dick Cheney, one of the architects of the most recent war there, to take a more prominent public role in trying to shape the foreign policy debate in favor of a more muscular approach. In a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed that mostly focused on Obama, he and daughter Liz Cheney argued that \"U.S. withdrawal from the world is disastrous and puts our own security at risk.\", In response to Pauls public criticism over Cheneys role in Iraq, Cheney fired back by telling ABC News that Paul was \"basically an isolationist.... That didnt work in the 1930s. It sure as heck wont work in the aftermath of 9/11, when 19 guys armed with airline tickets and box cutters came all the way from Afghanistan and killed 3,000 of our citizens.\", Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist who worked for Cheney in the White House, said there was space for him because no potential Republican candidate had thus far outlined a comprehensive foreign policy strategy., \"The political genius of Dick Cheney has always been as a provocateur,\" he said. \"Hes going to play an enormous role in framing the debate in 2016.\", Republicans running in 2016 would be wise to develop a clear vision, he said., \"I think national security issues are underappreciated in general in the context of how important they are and how determinative they can be in a Republican nominating contest,\" Schmidt said. \"[The Middle East] is a caldron that is not on a trajectory to simmer down. So it is far more likely at this point that were going to see a world-on-fire scenario in a way that makes foreign policy a top-of-mind issue for voters.\", michael.memoli@latimes.com, Twitter: @mikememoli]", "Date": "20140706", "Title": "[Republicans can't seem to agree on Iraq and Middle East strategies]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-gop-iraq-20140707-story.html", "Author": "[Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, The crowded field of prospective Republican presidential hopefuls focused their animus on Hillary Rodham Clinton on Sunday, throwing a volley of jabs at the Democrat as she entered the 2016 presidential race., Her much-anticipated announcement, which came in a two-minute video, set off a flurry of fundraising emails from likely GOP presidential candidates looking to raise money off Clintons entry into the race and to assail her record in Washington., Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, in an online videoposted through his political action committee several hours before Clintons Sunday announcement, focused on her ties to President Obama., \"We must to do better than the Obama-Clinton foreign policy that has damaged relationships with our allies and emboldened our enemies,\" said Bush, who is expected to formally announce his candidacy this summer., Clintons tenure as secretary of State under Obama will be central to the criticism she receives from Republicans during the 2016 presidential race. She already has been scrutinized for security lapses surrounding the 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, in which Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens was killed., Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who announced his candidacy for president last week, released his first television ad Sunday, calling the former first lady the \"worst of the Washington machine.\", \"The arrogance of power, corruption and cover-up, conflicts of interest and failed leadership with tragic consequences,\" said the narrator in the minute-long TV spot, which is set to run in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada., The first-term senator also attacked Clinton on foreign policy as he made the rounds on several Sunday TV news shows., Paul has called for limited military interventionoverseas, and on Sunday he seemed to be castigating not only Clinton and Obama but some within his own party for supporting United Nations airstrikes in Libya prior to the consulate attack. , \"Interestingly, many of the hawks in my party line right up with President Obama. Think about the big issues weve had in the couple -- the last couple of years. The war that Hillary prominently promoted in Libya, many of the hawks in my party were right there with her,\" Paul said on CNNs \"State of the Union.\" \"Their only difference was in degrees. They wanted to go into Libya as well; they just always want boots on the ground. Some of the hawks in my party, you cant find a place on the globe they dont want boots on the ground., The symbolic 3 a.m. phone call that all presidents should be ready to handle in a crisis -- one that Clinton used in advertising for her 2008 presidential campaign -- was a \"phone call she never picked up,\" Paul said of Clinton., Clinton, who could face primary challenges from former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley and former Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia, is scheduled to soon travel to meet with voters in to Iowa, the state that holds the nations first presidential caucus -- a contest she lost to then-Sen. Obama in 2008., Her entry into the race drew a jab from Iowa Republicans: We welcome Mrs. Clinton to her long expected Democratic coronation, Jeff Kaufmann, the states GOP chairman, said in a statement., The Republican National Committee has also released an ad in recent days that seeks to cast doubt on Clintons candidacy., The ad uses various sound bites from news reports to target Clinton on issues such as her use of a private email server to conduct business as secretary of State and her effort to \"reset\" U.S.-Russia relations., \"This is just par for the course for the Clintons, theyre always a little bit secretive,\" says the narrator in a reference to the email controversy that engulfed Clinton last month., The final onscreen text is simple in its message: Stop Hillary., \"Voters want to elect someone they can trust and Hillarys record proves that she cannot be trusted,\" RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement. \"We must Stop Hillary.\", Twitter: @kurtisalee, 12:51 p.m. This post has been updated with additional details and background., This post was originally published at 10:46 a.m.]", "Date": "20150412", "Title": "[As Hillary Clinton enters race, Republicans are ready with potshots]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-republicans-react-hillary-presidential-bid-20150412-story.html", "Author": "[Kurtis Lee]"}
{"Content": "[[, The Democratic National Committee on Thursday selected Philadelphia as the site of the partys 2016 national convention, citing the citys experience in hosting large-scale events., Philadelphia, renowned for attractions such as Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell, edged out Columbus, Ohio, and New York City for the opportunity to host delegates from across the country for a presidential nominating convention to be held much earlier in the election year than in previous cycles., Last month, Democrats announced the convention would be held the week of July 25, 2016, several days after the Republican National Committee is scheduled to hold its convention in Cleveland. The Democrats choice to schedule a convention so close to the Republicans is viewed by some as an effort to slow any momentum the new GOP nominee will have coming out of the convention as they look to benefit from the committees general election funds., The Republicans choice of Cleveland renewed a debate over whether placing a partys convention in a swing state, such as Ohio, can help tilt the vote in that state, though the theory hasnt held up in past election cycles., Pennsylvanias 20 electoral votes are coveted in presidential elections. President Obama won the state in 2008 and 2012., Logistics are also a factor in convention site choices: In a conference call with reporters Thursday, Democratic officials lauded Philadelphia for its public transportation and 18,500 downtown hotel rooms that are close to Wells Fargo Center, the conventions venue., Delegate experience is important. We want our delegates to leave the convention energized, said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), the DNCs chairwoman., Republicans held their 2000 convention in Philadelphia, which Democratic Party and local officials said put the city in a strong position to host next years convention., We do big events well, said Mayor Michael Nutter., The convention adds to the roster of big events in Philadelphias future: In September, the city will host Pope Francis, who will take part in the World Meeting of Families conference and will celebrate a Mass on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway that is expected to draw 2 million people., The DNC signed the final contract with Philadelphia on Thursday, and Philadelphia has committed to raising $85 million to host the convention. Cleveland committed to raising about $70 million to handle security and other expenses to host the Republican convention., Pennsylvania Democrats who backed the citys wooing of the DNC included former Gov.

{"Content": "[[, The dryly titled report released last week  \"The Status of Latinos in California\"  was either uplifting or unnerving for the Latino political establishment, depending on whether the viewer was looking backward or ahead., Latinos represent 1 in 5 registered voters, said the report prepared for the Latino legislative caucus and other groups. They hold 1 in 4 Assembly seats, and sit on city councils in 27 of the states 58 counties. That is undeniable progress from the days when Latinos were shut out, often by a gerrymandering hand., But their voting strength is only half their proportion of Californias population, the report said. They hold 1 in 8 state Senate seats and an even smaller percentage of supervisorial chairs., Thats symptomatic of a troubling turn for Latino politicians and voters. Together with other data, it suggests the possibility of a ceiling forming over a group that, until recently, thought it had limitless upward mobility., Put bluntly, the caucus report showed that the best chances for Latino politicians come in small towns populated by Latinos. The higher up the political food chain the job, or the less Latino the political district, the worse their odds of success. It was enough to feed fears that the desire for historic firsts  a first Latino U.S. senator, a first Latino California governor  will be thwarted in 2016 and 2018., \"When is California ripe for a Latino senator or governor? The time couldnt be more ripe than right now,\" said Roger Salazar, a Clinton administration veteran who is a spokesman for the Latino caucus. \"But now the question is: How do you get that to happen?\", Concern about their future has blossomed as Latinos, long the most politically important minority group in the state  even though, yes, its now the largest in population  have found themselves somewhat eclipsed by Asians. The worry is an uncomfortable one, given that the groups are political twins, working together on many issues and backing the same national candidates, which is to say Democrats., Asians, powered by highly organized networks of donors and voters, have pulled off bipartisan surprises in recent regional elections that have raised eyebrows among Latinos. And at the state level, Asians have been even more dominant, claiming as representatives Treasurer John Chiang, Controller Betty Yee and Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, whose mother was Indian., \"Theres a reason why three of the 10 statewide officeholders are Asian,\" said Mike Madrid, a Republican strategist and Latino voting specialist who praised the political acumen of the Asian community., For Latinos, upward movement is complicated by problems connected to the poor turnout of Latinos in their geographic base, Southern California, and the difficulty of raising money when home districts lack abundant wealth., Statewide candidates cast a wary eye about whether to run when their own voters are undependable, for example, yet an exciting candidacy is the surest way to get voters to turn out, making for something of a stalemate. Some problems are self-fulfilling: Statewide campaigns spend their money where they have the best chance of good return, and that means focusing on those more likely to vote, not less. Rarely is there enough left over to cultivate long-shot voters, which many Latinos have become, but the disinterest by campaigns can perpetuate disinterest by voters., Money remains a big issue. Hilda Solis, a former congresswoman and Labor secretary elected last year to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, contrasted how Latinos and Asians have approached campaigns., \"They are very disciplined and thats a good trait. Thats something any campaign needs to have. Im not saying it cant be done by Latinos  we also have to be a lot more disciplined. I think thats something you learn,\" she said. \"Its almost like maturity. Ive had to go through it myself. At first you think its distasteful getting on the phone and asking for money  well, thats part of life.\", State Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Len, from Los Angeles, said he was discussing measures to shift election days to the weekend to boost turnout, a move he said would be bipartisan but which, in practice, would potentially be a boon to Latino voters and, by extension, candidates. (Although four Latinos have served as Assembly speaker in the last 19 years, De Len is the first Latino Senate president pro tempore, and the number of Latinos in the Legislature has flatlined in the last 10 years.), Latinos running in the states upcoming U.S. Senate race are long shots, at this point. Assemblyman Rocky Chavez of Oceanside is barely known and a Republican in a state that hasnt elected one statewide in a decade. U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez of Santa Ana, a Democrat, may be better known but has had a troublesome campaign start compared to Harris, the San Franciscan who benefits from being a statewide officeholder. (Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa briefly considered a Senate run and is now pondering the 2018 governors race.), Sanchez has overtly played the history card, asserting at her May announcement that \"I would be the first Latina ever elected to the United States Senate.\", Others remain in the wings. De Len said that he was \"not going to rule out any potential run for future office at the statewide level.\" Labor leader Maria Elena Durazo touted Solis as a potential statewide or Senate candidate before Solis had even announced her run for supervisor. Asked whether shes interested, Solis brushed the notion aside., \"I have seven months under my belt right now,\" she said, referring to the board position, \"and I love what Im doing ... Im not interested right now, to be quite honest.\", But, she said, \"I want to see more women, Latinas and Latinos running for higher office. And it will come.\", cathleen.decker@latimes.comTwitter: @cathleendecker, Hoy: La esta historia en espaol]", "Date": "20150712", "Title": "[Report shows a troubling turn for Latino politicians and voters  ]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-pol-california-politics-latinos-20150712-story.html", "Author": "[Cathleen Decker]"}
{"Content": "[[, The email came with a simple subject line: Our Flag., \"Well, you finally did something that I dont agree with,\" wroteGlenn Langford, a constituentof then-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in February 2001. \"My Southern-Florida heritage is important to me.\", Langfords correspondence was one of many that arrived shortly after Bush decided to take down the Confederate flag from its perch outside the west entrance of the state Capitol in Tallahassee. It had flown there since 1978., The debate over the Confederate flag, to some a symbol of racial hatred and to others a prided symbol of the South, has again come to the forefront after the shooting of nine black parishioners at a historic church in Charleston, S.C., It has forced the 2016 GOP presidential field to address questions on both race and states rights at a time when the party is grappling with how to become more inclusive of minority voters., In a show of solidarity, many GOP presidential candidates have lauded the decision by Republican South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to call for the Confederate flag to betaken downfrom a monument outside the state Capitol., For two GOP candidates, Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the issue is one that theyve had to deal with first hand., Bush decided in 2001 -- with little public discussion -- that it was time to retire the Confederate flag., \"Regardless of our views about the symbolism of the ... flags -- and people of goodwill can disagree on the subject -- the governor believes that most Floridians would agree that the symbols of Floridas past should not be displayed in a manner that may divide Floridians today,\" said Bushs spokeswoman at the time., His decision followed the bitter 2000 presidential election between his brother George W. Bush and Al Gore, which hinged on Floridas 25 electoral votes. Some blacks felt marginalized by the disputed election and complained that their votes were not accurately tallied for Gore., In 1999, Bush upset many blacks and Latinos by signing an executive order that barred state schools from using racial preference in determining admission., \"Minority voters -- in particular black voters -- were upset,\" said Susan MacManus, a political science professor at University of South Florida in Tampa. \"That came more from Bushs actions on affirmative action. No one was really raising a big issue about the flag at the time.\", Compared with other Southern governors, Bush was on the cutting edge of the issue, MacManus noted. The debate is now underway in the Tampa area, where a massive Confederate flag flies along Interstate 75 at a memorial. Tampas mayor said it needs to be taken down. Neither Bush nor Rubio have spoken publicly on the issue., In 2001, Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, was a fresh-faced state lawmaker. He co-sponsored legislation in the weeks after Bushs decision, which stated that no \"historic flag commemorating or memorializing the American Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican War, the Civil War ... displayed on public property of the state or any of its political subdivisions may be relocated, removed, disturbed or altered.\", The legislation, a rebuttal of sorts to Bushs decision, ultimately failed., ------------,  FOR THE RECORD June 25, 3:53 p.m.:An earlier version of this article attributed a quote from Ben Carson to Marco Rubio. ,  ------------, In comments this week, Rubio has said the issue of the flag is one for SouthCarolinians to decide., Ultimately the people of South Carolina will make the right decision for South Carolina, and I believe in their capacity to make that decision, he told reporters in Miami last week., When asked, Bush has been slightly more direct, alluding to his decisionin Florida, where the flag is now in\"a museum where it belonged.\", MacManus said that in Florida -- outside of the I-75 dispute -- the controversy is largely settled, adding that it will have little bearing in next years GOP primary in the state., \"But its most certainlygoing to come up and [Bush and Rubio] will have to discuss it in the coming months, especially with the importance of South Carolina as an early voting state,\" she said., Follow @kurtisalee on Twitter for political news.]", "Date": "20150625", "Title": "[Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio are no strangers to Confederate flag debate]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-bush-rubio-florida-confederate-flag-20150624-story.html", "Author": "[Kurtis Lee]"}
{"Content": "[[, The embers of Watts had cooled as Ronald Reagan raced toward his first election as Californias governor, a year after riots scarred southern Los Angeles., Yet Watts remained an ominous political presence., As Reagan took on two-term incumbent Pat Brown in what was then an overwhelmingly white and culturally conservative state, Watts and other emblems of the era  civil rights battles, Vietnam War protests and counterculture elbow-throwing  contributed to a frightening sense that California was spinning out of control., Voters reacted to the chaos by embracing a new wave of conservatism that swept Reagan into the governors office and paved his way to the White House. In California, the conservative tide would rise for a generation: Reagan begat George Deukmejian and Pete Wilson, 24 years of Republican governors in a 32-year stretch., The backlash spread beyond Californias borders as well., Aug. 13, 1965: Los Angeles police officers stand guard at Avalon Boulevard and Imperial Highway, near Watts., , Aug. 13, 1965: Los Angeles police officers stand guard at Avalon Boulevard and Imperial Highway, near Watts., , Gov. Pat Brown, left, on \"Meet the Press\" with challenger Ronald Reagan in 1966. , , Gov. Pat Brown, left, on \"Meet the Press\" with challenger Ronald Reagan in 1966. , , Two years after Reagan won the governorship, the same political winds helped propel Richard Nixon to the presidency  another beneficiary of an electorate worried about societal change and choosing the candidate who took a law-and-order approach. The Republican Party, buoyed by those put off by Democratic views on civil rights and the war, saw its ranks grow nationally., Watts was \"a turning point in a year of turning points, and one of the most important,\" said James T. Patterson, an emeritus history professor at Brown University and author of \"The Eve of Destruction,\" a book about the American transformation wrought in 1965., Yet, 50 years hence, the impact of Watts on Californias politics is negligible. Massive demographic changes have utterly remade the state, sweeping aside the eras Republican gains., In place of those who dominated the states politics in the years after Watts has risen a coalition of Democratic allies. They include Latinos, then such an official nonentity that their presence went unmentioned in census reports, Asian voters, socially liberal whites and African Americans  the most dependable voters on the left., All of that was unforeseen when a traffic stop in Watts put a torch to the city., On its own, Watts didnt defeat Brown, the governor who swept into office in 1959 and built many of the institutions that stand today, from the California Water Project to the states university and college system. As the riots hit, Brown was seeking his third term, a point at which voter adulation ebbs precipitously, and the previous years had been rocky., Student protests convulsed UC Berkeley, making it a national symbol of revolt. Brown, the father of Gov. Jerry Brown and the man who appointed the universitys leaders, bore the brunt. And while much of the activity in the burgeoning civil rights movement was occurring in the South, race reared in California as well., In 1963, Brown had supported and signed the Rumford Fair Housing Act, which outlawed discrimination in renting or selling property. Realtors mounted an initiative to rescind it, and the initiative won the support of two-thirds of California voters in 1964. The state Supreme Court kept the issue alive politically until ruling in 1966 that the initiative was unconstitutional., Then came Watts, a conflagration that began as the governor vacationed in Greece. By the time peace returned, 34 people were dead, a swath of Southern California was in ruins and residents throughout the state were jittery., Reagan entered the race in 1966 with a host of proposals that would seem familiar to a national audience in decades to come: a tax moratorium for retired homeowners, a study of the states tax structure, the removal of judges from \"the influence of partisan politics.\" And he hit hard on the conflict of the era., \"Will we allow a great university to be brought to its knees by a noisy dissident minority? Will we meet their neurotic vulgarities with vacillation and weakness, or will we tell those entrusted with administering the university we expect them to enforce a code based on decency, common sense and dedication to the high and noble purpose of the university?\" Reagan asked in his announcement speech., He demanded heightened police powers, and said that Californias urban streets had become \"jungle paths after dark.\", It was \"a racially laden reference to Watts that no one could possibly misconstrue,\" author Ethan Rarick wrote in his biography of Brown, \"California Rising.\", It was not the only time Reagan would use the line, or brush against matters involving race., He had forcefully opposed the Rumford legislation and defended the initiative that repealed it. In a 1966 speech to the Realtors who had launched the initiative, he said the anti-discrimination act \"invaded one of our most basic and cherished rights  a right held by all our citizens  the right to dispose of property to whom we see fit and as we see fit.\", Some of the people who supported the initiative \"were expressing bigotry and racial prejudice, \" Reagan said, but added, \"I am sure that the majority did so because government was invading a constitutional right.\", In his 1980 campaign for president, Reagan kicked off his post-convention swing with an appearance near Philadelphia, Miss., where three young civil rights workers had been found dead 16 years earlier, in a famous slaying attributed to members of the Ku Klux Klan and local law enforcement officers., Reagans speech segued directly from a denunciation of welfare to wording used by segregationists: \"I believe in states rights,\" he said., Stu Spencer, the political strategist for Reagans gubernatorial and presidential bids, said the language used by Reagan had no racial import. \"He was not a bigot in any sense of the word,\" Spencer said. The 1966 jungle metaphor \"was a nice dramatic statement\" aimed at voters worried about rising crime, he said., As Spencer noted, Reagan did not speak often about Watts., \"Reagan didnt jump on it like a demagogue and milk it,\" he said. \"He really pointed to campus unrest. He kept pounding it. That was the overriding issue in many ways, I have always felt.\", Still, events kept Watts in voters minds. In March 1966, another riot broke out in Watts; two died. And just before the November election, rioting exploded in a black neighborhood in San Francisco., Brown broke off the campaign to tour the area, and Reagan dismissed him by saying the governor \"had not profited at all from the experience of Watts and has done nothing to forestall future disturbances in possible trouble spots.\", He also returned to welfare, saying Browns reelection would mean \"four more years of reckless welfare spending and no change in a welfare system whose only present purpose seems to be to perpetuate the dole and build a political machine.\", Brown asserted that Reagan was both \"riding\" and encouraging a \"white backlash.\", In an appearance on \"Face the Nation\" a few days before the election, Reagan replied that a backlash was \"nothing more than the concerns people have for  extremists in the civil rights movement taking to the streets, the use of violence, of demonstrations instead of an orderly process of appealing wrongs through legitimate channels.\" And he reiterated his objections to the anti-discrimination act and his line about urban streets becoming \"jungle paths.\", The San Francisco riot blunted a mini-comeback on Browns part, turning his long-shot effort into a rout for Reagan., Watts \"had a huge effect on the states political environment,\" said Brown biographer Rarick, the associate director of UC Berkeleys Institute of Governmental Studies., The era of violent protests and rioting deeply disturbed many Californians who had grown up in a more ordered society, Rarick said: \"It was one of several things that frightened a lot of people and made them uncomfortable and thereby helped fuel the rise of the conservative movement in California.\", That same instinct toward conservatism played out in Los Angeles in the first mayoral election after the 1965 riots  when incumbent Sam Yorty turned back a challenge from Tom Bradley  and after the 1992 riots, when the more conservative candidate, Richard Riordan, was elected to lead the city. (Bradley, a former police officer, would become the citys first African American mayor in 1973, eight years after Watts.), \"Reagan was looked upon as someone who could finally respond,\" said Boris Ricks, an assistant professor of political science at Cal State Northridge who was raised not far from the riots epicenter. \"Its just like after the civil unrest of 1992. Richard Riordan was elected because he was going to bring order back to the city. Ronald Reagan was going to bring it back to the state.\", In the half-century since Watts, the surge of new residents has altered the political profiles of Los Angeles and California. Bradleys 1973 election rested on coalition politics that linked African American voters with other groups; the citys new coalition features Latinos in a far more prominent role. The same is true of California, where only 8% of residents were nonwhite in the census before Watts; now more than 60% of the state is nonwhite., As before, political change is being driven by a reaction to events. Watts and 1960s protests once drove the state into conservatives arms. More recently, conservative positions have driven the state into Democratic arms., The country, in contrast, remains a far more competitive place: On the strength of the southern GOP brand developed by Reagan and Nixon  two Californians who ran law-and-order campaigns  the party owns the House and the Senate and remains competitive in the 2016 presidential contest. Not so in California, not any more., \"The state has changed so much,\" Rarick said. \"Once we were the people who gave Ronald Reagan to the nation. And now we elect only Democrats.\", cathleen.decker@latimes.com, Twitter: @cathleendecker. For more on politics, go to www.latimes.com/decker., Interested in the stories shaping California?

{"Content": "[[, The entertainment empire Rupert Murdoch is turning over to his sons James and Lachlan will face far different challenges from the ones he encountered during the last 60 years., Murdochs media companies, 21st Century Fox and News Corp., were built on news, television and film. All three of those areas are confronting generational and technological changes that are upending traditional business models., Young people are increasingly getting their news and entertainment from the Internet and social media sites  and less from television channels and multiplex cinemas, which have seen persistent declines in viewership and attendance. The audience of one beachhead, Fox News Channel, is growing older, and the companys Los Angeles-based Fox broadcast network has struggled to find a new generation of hits beyond this years sensation Empire., Rupert Murdoch is reportedly preparing to step down as chief executive of 21st Century Fox and hand the role over to his youngest son, James., Rupert Murdoch is reportedly preparing to step down as chief executive of 21st Century Fox and hand the role over to his youngest son, James., The 84-year-old Murdoch plans to soon relinquish his title of chief executive of 21st Century Fox to his younger son, 42-year-old James Murdoch, according to people familiar with the changes who were not authorized to discuss them publicly., Older son Lachlan Murdoch, 43, also is expected to assume a larger corporate role by becoming executive co-chairman of the company, working with his father, who will maintain his title as executive chairman. Lachlan Murdoch is expected to work in partnership with his younger brother but fill a more strategic, big-picture role., This transfer of power to a younger generation should make Fox more sensitive to the needs of millennials and more responsive to changing consumer habits, said Needham & Co. media analyst Laura Martin. Wall Street is going to need to be shown that [the sons] deserve the seat, and that its not just because of their daddys name. Wall Street is going to be very suspicious at first, because theres not much of a track record there., Some analysts said the younger Murdochs might be best equipped to navigate the changes facing media today., Its time, said Jeffrey Cole, chief executive of the Center for the Digital Future at the USC Annenberg School. This move positions things so that the money-making part of the empire  Fox  is on a steady and forward path. But Rupert is not going anywhere. He seems to be entering the Don Corleone stage of his life after he turned the business over to Michael., James Murdoch has been rising through the ranks for more than a decade. In recent years, he has served as the No. 3 executive, co-chief operating officer, behind his father and longtime President and Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey. Carey, who is well regarded on Wall Street, is expected to step down from the organizational structure to take on an advisory role., Wall Street analysts on Thursday noted they would be sorry to see Carey leave Fox because he provided a steady hand through a challenging era for the company., The Murdochs have weathered a spin-off of the Wall Street Journal, New York Post and other newspaper holdings into a stand-alone company, News Corp., and the devastating British phone hacking scandal. Carey also was a forceful and welcome presence last summer when Fox abandoned its proposed takeover of rival Time Warner when Fox shareholders began selling shares., For James Murdoch, the proposed new structure firmly establishes him as the day-to-day leader of the company  no longer the apprentice to Carey., It significantly clarifies the question of management succession and corporate governance, Tuna Amobi, media analyst with S&P Capital IQ, said in an interview., Lachlan Murdoch is expected to spend much of his time at the companys West Coast headquarters in Los Angeles, while James Murdoch is expected to continue to be based in New York., The Murdoch sons will have to figure out how to best position the company for the digital age, a realm that Fox has struggled with  a notable example being the $580-million acquisition and later sale of Myspace., The companys cable networks  its largest source of profit  will have to find ways to remain relevant amid cord-cutting by younger consumers and pay-TV providers who want to trim their programming packages., Its going to be about their ability to produce high-quality, differentiated content that is going to determine how well they make it through this, said Cowen & Co. media analyst Doug Creutz. Its not going to be easy for anybody, but the guys who have good content are going to make it through., The proposed new structure, which concentrates power among three family members, is unusual in todays corporate world. It is almost unheard of for publicly traded companies., Theres not one clear leader, and thats a big challenge, Martin said. Ruperts going to be in charge of some things, Lachlans in charge of some things, and James is in charge of some things. Thats a huge challenge that almost no other big media company faces., Investors seemed unmoved by the news. Fox shares closed down just 6 cents, to $32.90., Theyre facing the same tough environment as are all the other media companies, Creutz said. I would say Fox is relatively on the better side because they do have a fair amount of good content. They have a very strong international footprint, which a lot of their peers dont have. Theyve got something to work with., The Murdochs and Carey, through a spokesperson, declined interview requests., The matter of succession is on the agenda at our upcoming, regularly scheduled board meeting, a Fox spokesman said in a statement. , The board meeting is expected to be held next week. The Murdoch family controls 39% of the voting shares of Fox., Creutz, the Cowen & Co. analyst, noted that Foxs earnings this year havent met Wall Streets expectations, and that the company might have another downward revision. , A CEO transition at the same time would give James a chance to start with expectations having been reset to a presumably low bar, he said., In addition, Careys contract that was signed a year ago was short-term in nature, which prompted speculation that Murdoch was preparing to hand over his media empire to his sons sooner rather than later. , Should Mr. Carey elect to conclude the term of employment, he agrees to provide non-exclusive consulting services to 21st Century Fox through June 30, 2016, Careys contract says, according to a regulatory filing., , Twitter:@MegJamesLAT; , Twitter: @rfaughnder, Times staff writer Richard Verrier contributed to this report., , 5:56 p.m.: This article has been updated with new information throughout., 3:18 p.m. This article has been updated with closing stock information, 12:49 p.m.: This article has been updated with stock information., 8:33 a.m.: This article has been updated with background information on Murdoch succession planning and commentary from an analyst., The first version of this article was published at 7:48 a.m.]", "Date": "20150611", "Title": "[Rupert Murdoch's sons, taking charge of Fox media empire, will face new digital realities]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-et-ct-fox-shake-up-james-lachlan-rupert-murdoch-20150611-story.html", "Author": "[Meg James, Ryan Faughnder]"}
{"Content": "[[, The fact that Californias electoral logjam was breaking this winter after two decades of stability seemed to presage high drama: Big beams clattering violently downstream, a powerful rush of water, a cleansing whoosh to the political system in the state., Except it hasnt turned out that way., Heres the rundown so far: Barbara Boxer announced that she will retire after the 2016 election from the Senate seat she has held since 1993. Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, also a Democrat, quickly jumped into the race. And then?, Nothing. A million and one candidates are \"seriously\" considering the Senate race  who would admit to doing so not seriously?  but no one else has formally stepped forward., The absence of visible drama does not mean, however, that nothing at all is happening. Californias political industrial complex was still moving inexorably last week, a little less dramatically but no less potently, as it always does., On Wednesday, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom launched his campaign for governor, for which votes will not be cast until 2018. His signal effort was to establish a fundraising committee  an implicit reminder of the preeminent role of campaign cash, and the need to corral it year round and every year., Newsom noted in an interview with The Times that he faced the possibility of super PACs arrayed against him, not to mention the deep pockets of a potential challenger such as billionaire political donor Tom Steyer, who recently took himself out of the Senate race and is believed to be eyeing the executive contest., That same day, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa popped up in Washington, posing for pictures in the lobby of a luxury hotel and later receiving a public service award from the League of United Latin American Citizens., It was his second trip to D.C. in three weeks, and in both visits he held meetings to discuss the Senate race  last week with the Latino Victory Project, which helps elect Latinos to all levels of office. He didnt particularly want to talk about whether hed run., \"Im not going to make a comment about the Senate race until I have something to say,\" Villaraigosa said., The third in the trio of candidates who had been kept in amber by the absence of opportunities upstream was engaged last week in what will likely be her status quo for some time: getting around the state for her day job in ways that benefit her Senate candidacy., Harris held a Thursday event in Los Angeles to announce a new Bureau of Childrens Justice within the state Department of Justice. The bureau will dive into a strikingly broad range of issues involving children, from foster care to truancy, childhood trauma to education inequalities., Asked why the attorney general would be taking that vast role, Harris replied: \"Im the top cop in the state. I took an oath to concern myself with the safety of everybody in this state.\", Six cameras captured Harris comments, as two rows of reporters held on through almost an hour of discussion about the dire circumstances facing many California children. Aides moved through the reporters ranks in advance to say that Harris would not talk about the Senate race, as she was on government property and speaking as attorney general, not candidate., She was asked, of course, whether her presence in the states largest media market had anything to do with the Senate race., \"Im all over the state. I happen to live in L.A. half the time; its definitely someplace that I am,\" said Harris, who recently married a Los Angeles attorney. \"You are likely to see me here because I live here half the time.\", When would she talk about the Senate race?, \"In the coming weeks and months for sure,\" she said., It was a decidedly less dramatic rendition  with the same result  of what happened earlier in the week when reporters gathered around Harris as she left an appearance at Facebooks Northern California headquarters., \"No, no, no questions right now,\" an energetic aide cried, before trying to physically block San Francisco Chronicle reporter Carla Marinucci from recording video of the exchange. \"No questions right now.\", Harris, seeking a de-escalation, stepped in to declare that she would talk, soon. \"I do have to leave, but Im happy to talk with you at some point,\" she said., When the questions resumed, so did the aide: \"Im sorry, we have to get her moving! Im sorry, she is in a hurry!\", Harris has not been in too much of a hurry to array a host of endorsements widely seen as attempts to persuade Villaraigosa that a Senate race is not in his best interest. First came an embrace of Harris by African American politicians from Southern California, then a second from Latino politicians. And, last week, the Los Angeles police union jumped into Harris camp., The net result: a declaration from Harris to Villaraigosa that he will not have a hold on the groups that ensured his two elections as mayor and prior legislative wins: organized labor, Latinos and African Americans., Its not hard to guess her other behind-the-scenes action: studying up on issues that havent crossed her desk as a prosecutor but would as a senator. Those might include whether to support the presidents request for congressional authorization to use military force against Islamic terrorists, or any of the myriad other subjects that rise as potential tripwires for candidates., As the political machinery moved invisibly around her, she smiled brightly and implied some patience was in order., \"Weve got 16 months before that election,\" she told reporters in Los Angeles. \"It is quite some time off.\", cathleen.decker@latimes.com, Twitter: @cathleendecker]", "Date": "20150215", "Title": "[Drama from Boxer's retirement plays behind the scenes, for now]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-pol-california-politics-20150215-story.html", "Author": "[Cathleen Decker]"}

It could have led to Texas being required to seek approval from the Justice Department or a court before making any voting changes., Still, the ruling from the normally conservative U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals was celebrated by voting-rights advocates as a major victory., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, \"This is not only a triumph for voters of color in Texas who were explicitly targeted by this law, but for voters across the nation who face a rising tide of restrictive voter ID laws in their own states,\" said Penda Hair of the Advancement Project, a national civil rights organization., \"We recognize the charged nature of accusations of racism, particularly against a legislative body, but we also recognize the sad truth that racism continues to exist in our modern American society despite years of laws designed to eradicate it,\" the three-judge panel said in its unanimous decision., The panel found the laws requirement that voters present a photo ID discriminated disproportionally against blacks and Latinos.

{"Content": "[[, The federal Export-Import Bank, which was in danger of shutting down at months end because of strong conservative opposition, will live on after Congress approved a short-term extension of its charter., But on Friday businesses remained worried that the agencys days were numbered., \"Im very concerned,\" said Steven Wilburn, chief executive of FirmGreen Inc., a Newport Beach renewable energy company., The banks assistance has helped the company export its technology for extracting and cleaning biogas from landfills. The projects take about nine months to develop and Wilburn has to decide whether he wants to pursue aid if the bank might not be around., \"We have to make some decisions, and those are going to be a little bit like looking into a crystal ball,\" he said. \"Its going to be full of angst.\", Wilburn and other supporters of the bank, which provides loans and other assistance to foreign buyers of U.S. products, were relieved after lawmakers this week extended the banks charter until June 30., But that was much shorter than the five-year reauthorization sought by the Obama administration and leading business groups., \"Congress has left thousands of small, medium and large U.S. exporters and their workers in limbo until the middle of next year and this will likely negatively impact U.S. sales to foreign customers,\" said Boeing Co., the largest beneficiary of bank assistance., Chris Krueger, a senior analyst at financial services firm Guggenheim Partners, said the extension of the banks charter was only a temporary reprieve., \"Ex-Im received a stay of execution, but it remains on death row,\" he said., Krueger predicted that Congress would allow the bank to shut down next summer because its fate no longer would be helped by inclusion in legislation to avoid a government shutdown, as it was this week., \"Yes, Ex-Im lived to fight another day, but that day in June 2015 is likely its Waterloo,\" he said., The bank offers loans to foreign buyers of U.S. products, and insurance and other assistance to domestic exporters, at no annual taxpayer cost. The bank pays for its operations through interest and fees on its assistance., Last year, Ex-Im provided $27.7 billion in export assistance and sent a record $1.1 billion in profit to the Treasury. But taxpayers are on the hook for any losses on the banks $140 billion in outstanding assistance., Many conservatives, led by Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, criticize the aid as corporate welfare and complain that the bank mostly helps Boeing and other large companies., A strong conservative push to let the banks charter expire Sept. 30 gained steam over the summer after new House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) said he favored closing the agency., But heavy lobbying by businesses, led by Boeing, and leading trade groups helped persuade House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) to include an extension in a bill to temporarily fund the government for 10 weeks after the fiscal year ends Sept. 30., Conservative activist groups Heritage Action for America and the Club for Growth urged lawmakers to vote against the funding bill in part because it included the bank extension., But the bill, which also authorized President Obamas plan to arm Syrian rebels in their fight against Islamic State militants, easily passed the House on Wednesday and the Senate Thursday night., \"We think it was a huge missed opportunity,\" Dan Holler, spokesman for Heritage Action, said of the decision by Republican leaders to allow the bank to live., \"They had a chance to have a federal agency expire right before an election and go back home and campaign that they ended corporate welfare,\" he said., Bank President Fred Hochberg said he would continue to seek a long-term reauthorization from lawmakers., \"Businesses dont pursue overseas sales, invest in their operations or hire new employees on a month-to-month basis,\" he said after the Senate vote., \"Similarly, quality American goods shouldnt lose out to aggressive foreign competitors because of the Export-Import Banks still-uncertain future,\" said Hochberg, who has noted that about 60 other countries have similar export-assistance agencies to help their companies sell products abroad., Wilburn, of FirmGreen, said the uncertainty over the banks fate already has hurt his company., FirmGreen lost a $57-million project in the Philippines because a potential customer there, who was going to use Export-Import Bank assistance, opted for export financing from the South Korean government to import technology from that country instead, he said., \"My competitors technology is backed by the South Korean export bank  and what theyre using against me is this uncertainty,\" Wilburn said., Because of lost business, FirmGreen has been forced to reduce its permanent employees to six from 10  and might need to cut more, he said., The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Assn. of Manufacturers and nine other business trade associations wrote to congressional leaders last week urging them to quickly provide a long-term extension of the banks charter., \"Without Ex-Im Bank acting as a lender of last resort to fill market gaps, many foreign customers may turn to non-U.S. suppliers that already have significant support from their own official export credit agencies,\" the groups wrote., jim.puzzanghera@latimes.com]", "Date": "20140919", "Title": "[Export-Import Bank gets reprieve, but supporters remain worried]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-export-import-bank-20140920-story.html", "Author": "[Jim Puzzanghera]"}
{"Content": "[[, The federal government will embrace a much more active role in shaping efforts to integrate neighborhoods by race and class under new rules announced Wednesday., The rules, to be detailed by Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro at a speech in Chicago, require somecommunities around the country to study patterns of segregation and make plans to reduce itor to more evenly spread government resources. The rules clarify how grant recipients must meet a standard that was set in the Fair Housing Act of 1968 but has been inconsistently enforced., Supporters hope HUDs new plans  another instance of the Obama administration using its executive power to take on an entrenched issue  will create more low-income housing in neighborhoods with access to jobs and good schools, while detractors say the Obama administration is meddling in an issue best left to local communities., Too many Americans find their dreams limited by where they come from, and a ZIP code should never determine a childs future, Castro said in a statement. This important step will give local leaders the tools they need to provide all Americans with access to safe, affordable housing in communities that are rich with opportunity., The rules come on the heels of a major win for proponents of more integrated housing at the Supreme Court and an announcement that HUD is considering amending its calculations for low-income vouchers to attempt to allow more of their recipients to move into areas with increased access to jobs, transportation or education., Conservative critics call it federal overreach., HUD bureaucrats will be in a position to decide on their own whether your particular town meets their ideal of racial and income distribution, said Hans von Sankovsky of the Heritage Foundation. And if you dont meet their ideal of that mix, youre not going to get any money., But supporters hope the rules will help to reverse long-standing segregation they say has contributed to the persistence of racial and socioeconomic inequality., The point of the Fair Housing Act is racial integration in our residential situation, said University of Kentucky Law School Professor Robert Schwemm. All you have to do is look out at Baltimore or Ferguson or South Carolina and realize we havent made wonderful progress in the last 45 years., Research increasingly points to the idea that living in certain neighborhoods gives low-income families better opportunities. One study found that young children who moved from public housing to a low-poverty area would make an average of $302,000 more over the course of their lifetimes. In the same experiment, adults who moved to lower-poverty areas had better health outcomes., Bundled together with where you live is a whole bunch of other things like where your kids go to school, what kind of transportation is going to serve you, what kinds of jobs you have access to, whether you have a healthy environment, said Debby Goldberg of the National Fair Housing Alliance. The goal of this rule is to make sure we have greater equity and equality in terms of access to the opportunities that people need to succeed in life., The rules will require communities to identify segregation related to race and poverty and assess whether some areas have less access to resources such as public transportation and high-quality schools., Some who support the rules goals are nonetheless concerned that helping families move to higher-opportunity locations could drive some communities to move resources out of areas that need them the most., You dont want to further disinvest in neighborhoods that are challenged, former Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Carol Galante said in an interview before the final rules were announced. I would hope that at the end of the day were not talking about a zero sum game, but at the moment, its hard not to view it as that., Libby Starling, who piloted a similar planning process at the Metropolitan Council in the Twin Cities, said she found the process useful, but noted that it raised some concerns about the best policy prescriptions to deal with inequality among neighborhoods, especially when it comes to race., There are people of color who choose to live with other people of color. There are people of color who choose to live in predominantly white neighborhoods, she said. Both choices are viable., Both skeptics and supporters alike acknowledge that they are waiting to see how vigorously HUD enforces these rules to determine how significant their impact will be., In my view, its a very modest first step because theres no content in these rules about what HUD is going to do if jurisdictions dont do something to desegregate, Richard Rothstein, a research associate at the Economic Policy Institute, said ahead of Wednesdays announcement., But others are more optimistic that the planning process itself will lead communities to frank and productive conversations about residential segregation and access to resources., Americans really do care about broader society and broader community. I think that just by virtue of having that conversation were going to see a bunch of really innovative and really interesting things emerge, said Raphael Bostic, former assistant secretary for policy development and research at HUD., Marlene Nagel, who coordinated a similar analysis for the Mid-America Regional Council, said she thinks it raised awareness locally of issues related to affordable housing and access to resources., There has been an increased recognition of the need for greater housing choice throughout our community, she said., Twitter:@cdiersing]", "Date": "20150708", "Title": "[HUD chief on new housing rules: 'ZIP code should never determine a child's future']", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-fair-housing-rules-20150708-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, The fervent Republicans who throng the Conservative Political Action Conference every year arent representative of the American electorate. They arent even representative of the GOP electorate. For four of the last five years, their straw poll for president has chosen Rand Paul or Ron Paul. These are not everyday Republicans., Yet the conference, which took place Thursday through Saturday, is still an important event  the starting gun of the Republican primary campaign, in the words of one veteran GOP strategist. Its the first real national audition for potential Republican candidates, all on the same stage, one after the other  even if the TV audience is only on C-SPAN. And a good performance can help recruit conservative foot soldiers across the country., So almost everyone whos considering a run showed up, from CPAC favorites Rand Paul and Ted Cruz all the way to Jeb Bush, whos fighting off an unwanted label as the most moderate Republican in the race., Heres what we learned: Bush has staying power, despite conservatives suspicion that hes a closet moderate. Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, is hot  the new more-conservative hope to stop the Bush juggernaut. Sens. Cruz (R-Texas) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) could rise if Walker stumbles. Chris Christie looks like a spent force. And Rand Paul is still Rand Paul., Yes, its still early; none of these proto-candidates has even announced formally that hes running. But it wasnt too early for each to deploy campaign buttons and T-shirts in CPACs big convention hall. And that means it isnt too early to describe the rough shape of the 2016 GOP field: no single front-runner, but four or five candidates who are most likely to succeed., Bush didnt have the attendees on his side. There was a smattering of catcalls when he took the stage; a flag-waving activist in a Revolutionary War uniform led a decorous walkout of about two dozen., But Bushs organization had salted the room with supporters  a page from Practical Politics 101  and their cheers beat back the boos. Bush sensibly tackled the two issues on which he has diverged from his party orthodoxy  immigration and education  and while he attempted to make his positions sound as conservative as possible, he didnt trim them much., He repeated his support for legislation that would create a path to legal status for immigrants who are in the country illegally, although he agreed that enforcing border controls should come first. , On education, he defended the Common Core system of standards, which many conservatives loathe, insisting it was never intended to remove authority from state and local governments., Its fine to oppose the bad things, Bush said. We need to start being for things again. It was a solid, steady performance before a tough audience, and a step Bush needed, to remind GOP voters that hes a conservative too., But the real winner of the event may have been Walker, the usually taciturn governor of Wisconsin, who brought the audience to its feet with an animated speech full of red meat., Theres a reason we celebrate July 4 and not April 15, Walker said. We celebrate our independence from government, not dependence on it.... Get government out of the way., He listed his actions as governor  confronting public employee unions, lowering taxes, pushing anti-abortion legislation, lowering restrictions on concealed firearms  and said they showed that he is someone whos going to fight., He stumbled when, asked how he would handle Islamic terrorists, he suggested his experience as governor covered that, too. If I could take on 100,000 protesters [in Wisconsin], I can do the same across the world, he said  a parallel that doesnt hold up long., But his audience hardly noticed. , Hes the one, said Ruth Willis of Syracuse, N.Y. Hes already won more fights than any of the others. Cruz and Rubio were more polished  but as senators, neither could match Walkers executive experience far away from Washington., One more lesson: Republicans will be talking a lot about foreign policy in this campaign., Our allies no longer trust us and our enemies no longer fear us, Rubio warned. He charged that President Obama treats the ayatollah of Iran better than the prime minister of Israel., Rubio and others skipped ahead to criticize former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, whom they excoriated as no different from Obama in foreign affairs. She actually gave a reset button to the Russians, exclaimed Walker, to whoops from the audience. A reset button!, The growing hawkishness in conservative ranks is a bad sign for Rand Paul, who has broken with most of his colleagues to urge restraint in U.S. foreign policy. But its in keeping with recent polls that show most voters holding more confidence in Republicans than Democrats on foreign policy  a reversal of a GOP slump after the 2003 invasion of Iraq., What was missing from CPAC? Any sign of the intellectual ferment in conservative think tanks about how to address the stagnant incomes of the American middle class. Most speakers stuck to more traditional fare: smaller government, lower taxes, less regulation. There are new ideas in the Republican Party, but this, it seems, was neither the time nor the place., But Election Day 2016 is still a year and a half away.

{"Content": "[[, The field of candidates to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer began to take shape Monday, with Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris deciding to run for the seat and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom taking a pass., Harris plans to formally announce her bid for the 2016 contest today., \"Shes charting the course. Shes in with both feet,\" said an advisor who requested anonymity to discuss Harris plans., Boxers announcement last week that she would not seek reelection prompted immediate jostling among politicians in California, where there has not been an open U.S. Senate seat in more than two decades., Harris and Newsom, charismatic Democrats, were widely viewed as the top candidates for the post. Their decisions avert an ugly battle between the pair, who share many of the same supporters, have national profiles, are both from the Bay Area and are popular in the liberal wing of the Democratic Party., Newsom, in announcing that he would not seek Boxers seat, nodded to the notion that he plans to run for governor in 2018, when Gov. Jerry Brown cannot run again., \"Its always better to be candid than coy. While I am humbled by the widespread encouragement of so many and hold in the highest esteem those who serve us in federal office, I know that my head and my heart, my young familys future, and our unfinished work all remain firmly in the state of California  not Washington, D.C.,\" Newsom said in a statement., Newsom briefly ran for the post in 2010 before bowing out as it became clear that Brown would clinch the Democratic nomination. He did not deny that he remained interested., \"I think it would be a stretch to suggest that someone who was in the race briefly a few years back would not be considering something along those lines. I dont want to mislead folks,\" Newsom told The Times in an interview as he left Mayahuel, a Mexican restaurant a block from the Capitol, where he had lunch with California Secretary of State Alex Padilla., He denied that he and Harris cut a deal for each to run for different offices, as some have suggested they would do., It is \"nonsense that there is some kind of understanding,\" Newsom said, while hinting that he would support a Harris bid for Senate., Newsoms move was unsurprising in that he has made his desire to run for governor clear in recent years. He also has three young children, and he and his wife were reluctant to leave their Marin County home., Some had speculated that Harris, who is newly married to a Los Angeles-area attorney, would also be reluctant to move from California. But her husbands law firm has an office in Washington, D.C., and she has close relatives on the East Coast., If she is unsuccessful in her Senate run, she will remain attorney general, a top perch from which to seek higher office in the future., Other top Democrats weighing bids are former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer. Several members of Congress are contemplating entering the race, as well as at least three little-known Republicans., Among the top Democrats, Harris, 50, has a highly visible public platform as a second-term attorney general who gained fame for winning settlements from banks over misconduct in how they wrote mortgages., She would probably attract support from groups that want to increase the number of women in office, and from minority voters., She was barely elected to her post in 2010 among concerns that she was soft on crime, but she has since consolidated support among law enforcement., Her challenge is to create a credible, compelling reason for her candidacy, notably among voters who remain concerned about the states economy. Some view her as overly cautious. And her career will be picked apart, in particular her decision as district attorney in San Francisco not to pursue the death penalty against a cop killer., Her former personal relationship with former Assembly Speaker and San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown would also probably come under scrutiny., Villaraigosa was a two-term mayor of the largest city in the state and would draw the support of Latinos, a growing voter bloc that is likely to turn out in high numbers in 2016, the same year as the presidential election., But he too has personal baggage: adultery that led to the dissolution of his marriage and business decisions he has made since leaving office., In addition, he has been out of the public eye since 2013., Steyer, for his part, has an estimated fortune of $1.6 billion, giving him the ability to fund his own bid  significant in a state as large as California, where a Senate run will cost at least tens of millions of dollars., But the former hedge fund managers business record and investments will be scrubbed by his rivals, and he is vulnerable to charges of hypocrisy because although he is now a clean-energy crusader, he has made money on coal investments., Rose Kapolczynski, Boxers longtime campaign manager, said Harris decision to enter the race makes her the current front-runner to replace the senator, but she also pointed out that its early., \"Kamala Harris is a very strong candidate,\" Kapolczynski said, \"but I dont think we can say the race is over 17 months before the primary.\", seema.mehta@latimes.com, Twitter: @LATSeema, Times staff writer Patrick McGreevy in Sacramento contributed to this report.]", "Date": "20150112", "Title": "[Race to replace Sen.

{"Content": "[[, The fierce reaction to a botched Oklahoma execution may be fueled by the slow weakening of public support for capital punishment, which has coincided with a shift among Democratic politicians toward opposition to the death penalty., Capital punishment was one of a set of issues Democrats used in the early 1990s to toughen their image against accusations that they were soft on crime and criminals. Although many in earlier generations of politicians had opposed the death penalty -- contributing to Democratic losses in national races -- the candidates who drove the partys resurgence favored it., Then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton laid an overt marker for his view in 1992, when he interrupted his presidential campaign to return to Little Rock for the execution of a brain-damaged cop killer, Rickey Ray Rector., His wife and potential 2016 presidential candidate, Hillary Rodham Clinton, supports the death penalty, as does another potential candidate of her generation, Vice President Joe Biden. (President Obama has defended capital punishment for heinous crimes, although he voted as a state legislator not to expand its reach in less severe cases.), Even in the supposed liberal bastion of California, it has been rare since the early 1990s for Democratic candidates to oppose the death penalty. Barbara Boxer, a senator mocked by opponents as personifying the left, supports capital punishment, as does fellow Sen. Dianne Feinstein., But younger Democrats are taking the opposite position, one that would have threatened to blunt their rise in past years. In California, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris oppose the death penalty, as does Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. The three, all in their 40s, are presumed to be aiming for Senate or gubernatorial races in the not-so-distant future., Newsom has been the most open about his views., I think we should repeal the death penalty, he said last year during an appearance at San Francisco State. Its not a deterrent; there are racial components to it., Likewise, Martin OMalley, the 51-year-old governor of Maryland and would-be presidential candidate in 2016, last year capped a long campaign to eradicate capital punishment in his state when he signed a measure abolishing it., \"Over the longer arc of history I think youll see more and more states repeal the death penalty,\" OMalley told the Huffington Post. \"Its wasteful. Its ineffective. It doesnt work to reduce violent crime.\", Democrats have had some cover in their move toward opposition by fortuitous political circumstances: When Illinois became the first state to declare a moratorium on capital punishment in 2000, it was the work of a Republican governor, George Ryan. Ryans move came after a Chicago Tribune expose about mistakes that had consigned innocent people to death row., Although coverage of exonerated prisoners may have influenced public views of the death penalty, the real driver of change has been perceptions of crime. Periods marked by higher levels of fear about crime have generally coincided with greater support for capital punishment, and vice versa., The high mark for support came in 1994, when 80% of Americans favored the death penalty, according to the Gallup polling organization, which has asked about the issue since 1936. Not coincidentally, Americans in 1994 listed crime as the countrys most pressing issue., By last year, Gallup said, support had fallen to 60% of Americans. (A Pew Research poll taken this year said 62% of Americans supported capital punishment; the difference is statistically insignificant.), Views on the issue depended largely on politics and ethnicity. According to Gallup, support among Republicans continued to run strong, at 81%, to 60% for independents and 47% for Democrats., Pew found that while 63% of white Americans supported capital punishment, only 40% of Latinos and 36% of African Americans shared that view. Support had dropped for all three groups, Pew researchers noted., The bungled execution Tuesday night in Oklahoma  drugs meant to kill a convicted murderer did not, though he later died of a heart attack  may fuel a rise in the percentage of people who are troubled by the death penalty. According to a Pew survey taken in 2011, 27% of Americans said they opposed it because it was immoral, or wrong, or not within the rights of citizens. Another 27% cited the imperfect nature of the justice system, Pew said., cathleen.decker@latimes.com, Twitter: @cathleendecker]", "Date": "20140430", "Title": "[Voters, some Democratic politicians swinging against the death penalty]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-voters-democratic-politicians-death-penalty-views-20140430-story.html", "Author": "[Cathleen Decker]"}
{"Content": "[[, The first contest of the 2016 presidential race is only (!) a year away, and like most Americans, Ive been following the start of what promises to be a verrrry long political season with a mixture of anticipation and dread., Our process is just so exhausting., In addition to actually doing our civic duty--informing ourselves about the issues and the candidates--we have to expend a ridiculous amount of time evaluating each and every gaffe and controversy, deciding whether a) its real or ginned up; b) whether we have the energy to take our outrage to the next level; and c) how many Facebook friends we are willing to lose in the process., The campaign drags on for so long that I have come to appreciate, perhaps far more than I should admit, the entertainment value of the underdogs who jump in and keep swimming, even when it becomes clear they will drown (metaphorically) long before they reach the other shore., Who among us does not already miss businessman Herman Cain, whose blustery campaign for the Republican nomination came apart in late 2011 after several women said he had sexually harassed them when he was CEO of the National Restaurant Assn. in the late 1990s?, The Hermanator uttered one of my favorite all-time presidential campaign gaffes when, in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, he called Uzbekistan uz beki beki beki beki stan stan., (That was almost  but not quite  as amazing as watching the 2012 presidential campaign of Texas Gov.

Now, did you see a UFO?, Kucinich, to shocked laughter: I did....I saw something., Trying to recover, he joked about moving his campaign office to Roswell, N.M., then promptly threw as many presidents as he could think of under the bus. Now, you have to keep in mind that Jimmy Carter saw a UFO,\" said Kucinich, \"and also that more people in this country have seen UFOs than I think approve of George Bushs presidency., (Truthsquadding: Bush had an approval rating of about 30% at that point, while, as Russert pointed out, only 14% of Americans believed in UFOs.), This time around, we have a pretty good idea about who the major players will be. They are seasoned political players who, as far as I know, do not have a single UFO sighting among them., Democrat Hillary Clinton, who has said she will make her decision public probably after the first of the year (meaning now-ish) has been in campaign mode almost since she stepped down from her job as secretary of State after the 2012 election., Republican Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, said last month he will actively explore a run, and, according to the Washington Post, has resigned all of his corporate and nonprofit board memberships, including with his own education foundation., The spontaneity was squeezed out of these folks long ago. So who will provide our colorful distractions?, Who will be our Newt Gingrich of 2016, talking about colonizing the moon? Who will be our Michelle Bachmann, telling us about how the HPV vaccination causes mental retardation?, On the Democratic side, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is an actual socialist (as opposed to our current president, who is only accused of being one), but hes also a very seasoned political operator, and I see nothing in his history that hints at campaign trail loopiness., On the Republican side, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul has some indefensible ideas, but he does not approach the crack pottiness of his Libertarian father, Ron Paul, the perennial favorite of Ayn Rand-loving college students, who said during a 2011 debate that Iran should be able to have nukes., There is one person who gives me hope., After her losing turn as vice presidential running mate on the 2008 Republican ticket, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has made a mini-career of dangling the idea that she may run for president., I could not help but get a teensy bit excited over the weekend when she sparked a war of words with animal rights activists after praising her 6-year-old son for stepping on the back of his dog to reach the kitchen counter., PETA was not amused.

{"Content": "[[, The first time Barbara Boxers name showed up in a Los Angeles Times editorial, it was May of 1984 and she was a first-term U.S. representative from the Bay Area pushing legislation that would force utilities  including the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and the Metropolitan Water District  to pay market rates for power generated by the Hoover Dam. The editorial referred to her effort as the Boxer Rebellion, announced that the board was pleased that Boxer failed, but noted that the issue would revive in 2017 when the contract Congress approved over her opposition expired (it was recently extended until 2067)., Since then, Boxers name has been mentioned in 172 Times editorials, some favorable, some not-so-favorable (including the papers refusal to endorse her 1998 reelection against Republican challenger Matt Fong). And even though Boxer has announced she will not seek reelection in 2016, I suspect her name will show up on the editorial page a few more times before she ends her career in elective office. But judging by the history, its a guess as to whether the page will agree with her or fault her., In 1992, as Boxer and fellow Bay Area politician Dianne Feinstein were seeking seats representing California in the U.S. Senate, the editorial board chastised both women for emphasizing social issues  the nation was still arguing about sexual harassment allegations by Anita Hill against new Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas  over economic issues (the editorial urged a focus on growing wealth inequality). Though The Times did not endorse candidates in presidential, senatorial and gubernatorial elections in those days, itwelcomed the victorious Boxer (and Feinstein) to the Senate and praised them for helping the upper legislative chamber look a bit more like the people it represents., During Boxers first term, the page gave the senator credit for drawing attention to Californias effort to create a low-level nuclear waste dump site in Imperial Countys Ward Valley, some 40 miles from the Colorado River; Boxers actions ultimately helped killed the plan. Though the project was of national importance, the board said, it was not on the national political radar screen until Sen. Barbara Boxer put it there, drawing attention to neglected, disturbing studies of radioactive pollution paths Californians owe a debt of gratitude to her vigilance. The board also joined Boxers call for open hearings by the Senate Ethics Committee on sexual and official misconduct allegations against Republican Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon, a hot-button issue that involved both gender and party politics. But when Boxer faced off against Fong in her first reelection, the board (by then back in the Senate endorsements game) went with Fong:, Sen. Barbara Boxer has been a staunchly loyal defender of the handful of issues that drive her: a womans right to an abortion, environmental protections, tough gun control. On all of these issues, shes been a dependable vote. Dare we ask for more in a U.S. senator for California?, We do dare. We dare to ask for a senator who can forge new alliances, nationally and internationally, to benefit California. A leader for the states disparate and too often disorganized representatives in Congress. A senator who demonstrates a willingness to engage in, and readiness to take charge on, a wide variety of economic and social issues that will face the nations most diverse and populous state., The editorial page may have asked, but Boxer delivered an answer it didnt like, trouncing Fong by 10 percentage points. Afterward, the board chastised her over the harsh tone of the campaign: It was unfortunate that Boxer had to resort to such a negative campaign in recent weeks to win. Now, we hope she will expand her horizon and become a more effective senator for the state., The pro-free-trade board disagreed with Boxer in 2000 on protectionist policies for California citrus growers but appreciated her 2002 efforts to preserve wilderness land in the state and to revive the Superfund tax. In fact, the page decided when Boxer ran for her third term in 2004 that she merited an endorsement against former Republican Secretary of State Bill Jones. The page called her an unabashed liberal. Though her critics use the word derisively, liberal is not a disqualification for office in California. A majority of voters are in tune with Boxer on the environment, a womans choice on abortion and gun control. Though Boxer has in the past seemed too much the advocate and too little a lawmaker, she has worked during her second term on being more effective . But Boxers opposition has helped prevent misguided exploration for oil and gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, block confirmation of extremist judicial nominees and prevent new offshore oil drilling in the West. Boxer also is sponsoring a bill to create new federal wilderness areas in California., Californians benefit, in terms of federal dollars and clout, from having two increasingly senior senators representing the state. Boxer deserves reelection., But it was far from blanket support. When Dubai Ports World wanted to buy some U.S. shipping ports in 2007, Boxer opposed it, despite backing an earlier effort by Cosco to move its shipping operations from the Port of Long Beach to a closed naval base. Congress, fearing Cosco was a front for Chinese spies, \"scotched the deal,\" though Boxer supported it. What was the difference between the two? Cosco came before 9/11, and the Dubai Ports World proposal came afterward. The page, though, smelled politics: One possible explanation is that the Cosco deal was heavily backed by a Democratic administration, while the Dubai Ports World deal is heavily backed by a Republican administration. But that would mean Boxer is working against the interests of her state in order to score cheap political points. She would never do such a thing. Would she?, The page thought so when Boxer pushed the Passenger Bill of Rights in 2007 after JetBlue passengers were stranded for hours on tarmacs by East Coast storms., JetBlue screwed up big time. But that doesnt mean Congress needs to intervene with headline-chasing legislation such as a Passenger Bill of Rights proposed by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Rep. Mike Thompson (D-St. Helena)., Boxer and Thompson want to impose regulations requiring airlines to let passengers deplane when on-ground delays stretch longer than three hours, provide better information about delays and cancellations and offer stranded passengers food, water and adequate restrooms., The answer? Market forces, said the board. But in 2009, the board supported Boxer (and Feinstein) in their effort to remove some of the partisanship from selection of federal judges by using state screening panels to recommend people to submit to the White House as potential candidates. By the time Boxer stood for what turned out to be her last run for Senate, though, The Times had cooled and sat out the Democratic primary., We find that were no fans of incumbent Barbara Boxer. She displays less intellectual firepower or leadership than she could. We appreciate the challenge brought by Robert Mickey Kaus, even though hes not a realistic contender, because he asks pertinent questions about Boxers lockstep liberalism on labor, immigration and other matters. But we cant endorse him, because he gives no indication that he would step up to the job and away from his Democratic-gadfly persona., The fast-growing population of California voters who no longer affiliate with a party are seeking a dynamic and creative representative to help direct national policy. But the substantive debate about whether Boxer or the Republican nominee is the best person must wait until after the primary. Then, we hope, it will be possible to endorse a candidate., Boxer won easily, and by fall the idea of a Sen. Carly Fiorina was a bit much; the page endorsed Boxer., Boxer has been a voice  if sometimes a strident one  for values promoted by this editorial page: individual rights, equality, environmental protection and constructive engagement by the federal government with national economic problems, including the crisis in healthcare., We have criticized Boxer in the past for not exercising influence commensurate with her seniority. For example, as chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, she has brought creative ideas to the process of crafting a six-year transportation bill, but she bears some responsibility for the panels failure to produce one  the legislation is now a year overdue. Part of the problem is an assertiveness that often is perceived as arrogance., But the paramount responsibility of a senator is to cast the right votes for her state and her country. By that measure, the contrast between the two candidates couldnt be starker., So whats the last editorial to mention Boxer? It came in June as the board backed legislation Boxer pushed, the International Violence Against Women Act, that calls for the U.S., in countries where it is engaged in foreign assistance, to address the problem of violence against women and girls, to help create programs to educate local populations about recognizing and preventing such violence, to promote gender equality and to support existing programs that are confronting these issues., The board said the measure was broad and somewhat vague. But it should not be controversial. Yet it was. And Boxer, as she so often has been, was right in the middle of the fight. The board might not have always agreed with Boxer, but I doubt it would argue that the Senate will be a less interesting place without her., Follow Scott Martelle on Twitter @smartelle.]", "Date": "20150108", "Title": "[Barbara Boxer: A voice for individual rights, equality, environmental protection and more]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-barbara-boxer-retire-2016-20150108-story.html", "Author": "[Scott Martelle]"}
{"Content": "[[, The GOP has added two more Californians to its list of House members it considers most vulnerable in next years elections., The National Republican Congressional Committee on Friday named Reps. Stephen Knight (R-Palmdale) and Jeff Denham (R-Turlock) to its Patriot Program. The program gives added attention, including fundraising help, to reelection campaigns in districts most likely to flip to the Democratic column in 2016., Knight and Denham join Rep. David Valadao (R-Hanford), who was the only Californian among the initial list of 12 vulnerable GOP representatives released earlier this year., All three represent former Republican strongholds where Democrats have made registration gains. But Democrats see the northern Los Angeles County district of Knight, a freshman, as a particularly strong prospect as they try to build their numbers in Congress., Knight recently was caught on a video, posted on YouTube, telling a protester he would \"drop your ass\" if the man, who patted the congressmans arm during an argument, touched him again., The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee seized on the video to portray Knight as a hothead, and on Knights lackluster fundraising.  He raised just $40,800 between the November election and March 31, according to his campaign filings with the government. He reported $29,000 in his campaign treasury and owing more than $52,000., Contested House races can cost into the millions of dollars and incumbents anticipating a challenge usually begin raising money vigorously early in the election season., \"One-Term Wonder Congressman Knights election last year was a fluke, and now National Republicans are scrambling\" to save him, DCCC spokesman Matt Thornton said Friday in a news release highlighting Knights addition to the GOPs vulnerability list., Knights addition came a day after Democrat Lou Vince announced he was going to run for the seat. Vince, a Los Angeles Police Department lieutenant who lives in Agua Dulce, ran in last years primary for Los Angeles County Sheriff., Another Democrat, Maria Gutzeit, a Santa Clarita Water Board member and chemical engineer, also is considering enteringthe race, according to Roll Call.

{"Content": "[[, The harshest charges against Hillary Rodham Clinton  that she made decisions that favored donors to her familys charitable foundation when she was secretary of State  arent sticking. Yes, the Obama administration approved a donors sale of U.S. uranium mines to a Russian firm, but Clinton does not appear to have been involved. Yes, the administration concluded a trade treaty with Colombia that benefited Clinton Foundation donors, but that was President Obamas decision, not Clintons. And yes, Clinton lobbied foreign governments on behalf of donors such as General Electric and Boeing  but thats part of every secretary of States job description., Still, that doesnt mean candidate Clinton has emerged unmuddied from the swamp of accusations and innuendoes stirred up by conservative author Peter Schweizer in a book scheduled for publication this week. The front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination still has some explaining to do., When she was nominated as secretary of State in 2009, Clinton promised that she would bend over backward to avoid potentially compromising situations., Out of [an] abundance of caution and a desire to avoid even the appearance  of a conflict, Clinton said, the foundation would agree to strict rules: It would disclose all its donors and clear new contributions from foreign governments with the State Department., Only that didnt happen. The biggest branch of the Clintons charitable network, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, never complied with the agreement at all, according to the Boston Globe. It neither disclosed its donors nor cleared new contributions. (A spokesman said they didnt think it was necessary. After media inquiries, the program published a list of donors last month.) The Clinton Foundation also failed to clear a donation of $500,000 from Algeria. (An oversight, the foundation said.) And the foundations Canadian affiliate collected millions of dollars without disclosing donors names. (Canadian law guarantees privacy to donors, but the foundation could have asked them to voluntarily disclose their identities; it didnt until last week.), Beyond the Clinton Foundation and its affiliates, former President Bill Clintons personal income has raised eyebrows, too., Thanks to the Washington Post, we have learned that Bill Clinton made almost $105 million giving speeches from 2001 to 2012  and his biggest fees came from foreign hosts while his wife was secretary of State: $1.4 million from a Nigerian media firm (for two visits to Lagos); $750,000 from the Swedish telecommunication giant Ericsson; $600,000 from Dutch financial firm Achmea; and $500,000 from Renaissance Capital, a Russian investment bank with ties to Vladimir Putins Kremlin., The former president did take one sensible precaution: He cleared his speech gigs with State Department ethics lawyers. According to records obtained by the gadfly group Judicial Watch, the lawyers approved every one ofthe 215 speeches that were proposed., Theres nothing illegal about any of that; other former presidents have accepted giant speaking fees, too. Ronald Reagan once picked up $2 million for a trip to Japan  and that was in 1989 dollars., But theres nothing pretty about that picture, either. Even though the lawyers approved the deals, dozens of the firms that paid Bill Clinton were doing business with the U.S. government at the time. Surely Hillary Clintons 2009 promise to avoid even the appearance of any conflict of interest should have applied to her spouse as well as the family foundation  right?, The Clinton Foundation has taken one step in the direction of reform: It said it would stop taking money from most foreign governments while one of its namesakes is running for president. For the most part, though, Clinton has tried to deal with bad press by either ignoring it or deploying underlings to attack her critics., Thats not going to work; Clintons problems wont just go away., A successful candidate, at least in the Democratic primaries, needs to reassure voters that she can reduce the impact of money in politics and restore confidence in government. Right now, Clinton cant do that credibly., And Clintons conflict-of-interest problems will dog her in the debates that will begin in August. The Clinton Foundation  thats a fair issue, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said Thursday as he announced his candidacy. (The bigger issue, he added, is the huge amount of money it takes to run a campaign.), Hillary Clinton cant undo the past. But here are four things she can do to improve the situation now: She can press the Clinton Foundation and its affiliates for disclosure of all donors, in belated compliance with the agreement they made in 2009. She can ask the foundation to tighten its limits on foreign donations  for example, to cover individuals with close ties to foreign governments. She can ask her husband to tighten his criteria for speaking fees, too, and make it clear that hell donate his biggest paychecks to charity. Most important, she can spell out the rules she expects her family to live under if voters decide to put her in the White House., Last week, I asked the Clinton campaign if they saw merit in any of those ideas.

{"Content": "[[, The heavyweights of the crowded 2016 presidential field,Hillary Rodham ClintonandJeb Bush, laid out starkly different visions Friday for uplifting the plight of blacks in America, as the two appeared at the same event for the first time since they announced their runs for office., Each came to the annual conference of the National Urban League in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to sway a crucial segment of the electorate., Clintonis eager to maintain the enthusiasm that black voters showed President Obama when they turned out for him in record numbers, propelling him to victory in key swing states., Bush is eager to reverse the trend. TheRepublicanhopes toconvinceblack voters to rethink their traditional alliance with the left as part of his effort to widen the appeal of the GOP to the minority populations that are becoming an increasingly dominant force in presidential elections., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, Overshadowing the event was the sustained period of racial unrest in America, sparked by the 2012 shooting death of Florida teen Trayvon Martin and propelled by rioting in Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore as well as the recent rampage by a gunman in a historic black church in Charleston, S.C. The prison cell death just weeks ago of Sandra Bland, an African American woman arrested after she failed to use her turn signal, also weighed heavily on the convention., Clinton, as well as otherDemocratswho spoke at the event Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley forcefully and personally confronted those issues and the national protest that has resulted. Bush took a more subdued approach, focusing his speech on policy points, presenting a conservative agenda he vows would empower inner-city minorities., While Florida is Bushs home state, Clinton clearly had the home-court advantage Friday. Hillary and Bill Clinton have deep ties in the nations prominent civil rights groups, and among mainstream politicians, they are favorites in the black community. Even after some uncomfortable interactions with the robust Black Lives Matter protest movement, the former secretary of State projected a level of empathy and authenticity the other candidates had difficulty matching. She was the only speaker to receive a standing ovation., The event afforded Clinton an opportunity to draw a sharp contrast with Bush and his oft-repeated right to rise slogan. She warned the hundreds of activists at the event to be wary of a mismatch between what some candidates say in a venue like this and what they actually do when elected., Then, without mentioning Bush by name, she declared, I dont think you can credibly say that everyone has a right to rise and then say you are for phasing out Medicare or for repealing Obamacare. People cant rise if they cant afford healthcare. They cant rise if the minimum wage is too low to live on. They cant rise if their governor makes it harder to get a college education. And you cannot seriously talk about the right to rise and support laws that deny the right to vote., But for much of the speech, Clinton strayed from her usual talking points to dive deep into the challenges of being black in America and the structural racism embedded in the countrys culture and economy., This is not just about statistics, as damning as they can be, Clinton said. This is about Americans doing some soul-searching and holding ourselves to account.  This is about all of us looking into our hearts and examining our assumptions and fears and asking ourselves what more can I do in my life to counter hate and injustice., She talked about the need for whites to ask themselves what it would be like to sit our son down and have the talk. Or if people followed us around stores or locked their car doors when we passed., OMalley, who is struggling with persistently low poll numbers, gave a similarly impassioned speech, drawing from his experiences as mayor of Baltimore. Police accountability was a central theme of his address. Sanders, who has surged in the polls but continues to have difficulty widening his reach to minority voters, stuck mostly to his boilerplate economic populism, underscoring the racial injustice embedded in the nations economic disparity., The one black candidate in the 2016 race, Republican Ben Carson, also spoke. He talked about his own experience growing up in Detroit in an urban neighborhood, fearing he would not live past 25. But he also attacked the entitlements and liberal economic policies implemented as part of a war on poverty, which he says has been a failure, creating a culture of dependency., Bush took the stage last. He ignored Clintons barb in his remarks, during which he declared, There are unjust barriers to opportunity and upward mobility in this country, and touted his record in Florida appointing black judges and boosting the number of minority-owned businesses., But he emphasized that his economic plan, which focuses on boosting the gross domestic product, would prove more beneficial to inner urban communities than those pushed by Democrats, which are rooted in restructuring the economy to move more of the countrys wealth to the middle class., \"Four percent growth is more enterprise in urban areas, more people moving in, a higher tax base and more revenuesin other words, a better chance to save our cities, he said. We can do this as a country. We can grow at a pace that lifts up everybody, and there is no excuse for not trying.\", Twitter:@evanhalper, ALSO:, Hillary Clintons new campaign strategy is shes now taking questions, Sanders is drawing big crowds -- but how long will they stick around?, Jeb Bush announces unprecedented fundraising haul of $114 million]", "Date": "20150731", "Title": "[Hillary Clinton takes a shot at Jeb Bush on race in front of black activists]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-clinton-bush-20150731-story.html", "Author": "[Evan Halper]"}
{"Content": "[[, The historic agreement on Irans nuclear program announced Tuesday virtually guarantees that the 2016 election will be fought over conflicting views of the outgoing presidents record, since the pacts endurance depends on the willingness of future U.S. presidents to see it through., Like the environment, immigration and Cuba policy before it, the deal is another major endeavor in which President Obama used his executive-branch authority to act unilaterally  meaning the change he put in place could be rolled back by any future president., However, the international nature of the multilateral accord could bind Obamas successors, particularly Republicans. It leaves them with the unenviable choice of implementing and enforcing a deal they had little or no hand in drafting and publicly opposed, or snubbing it and thus re-escalating tensions in the region or with U.S. allies who were partners in the talks., I see a lot of upside for candidates from the Republican Party to campaign on this deal and even to make brash promises to disavow it if they are elected. I see almost no upside for any successor to President Obama coming into office and, on Day One, scuttling an arrangement that would likely lead to an international crisis, said Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert at the Brookings Institution., The intensity of disagreement on the campaign trail over Obamas record rivals the differing evaluations of the Reagan administration., The path the next president takes will depend, of course, on who it is. Republican presidential hopefuls have become fond of noting on the campaign trail which Obama policies they would reverse on Day One, whether on healthcare, the economy, immigration or the environment., Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker vowed in his speech announcing his candidacy Monday that he would terminate the Iran agreement on his first day in the Oval Office. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry made a similar pledge Tuesday., Other candidates criticized the terms of the deal but gave little indication of how they would address them if they became president. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said a comprehensive agreement should require Iran to verifiably abandon, not simply delay, its pursuit of a nuclear weapons program., The people of Iran, the region, Israel, America and the world deserve better than a deal that consolidates the grip on power of the violent revolutionary clerics who rule Tehran with an iron fist, Bush said, labeling the deal appeasement., As Obamas own example shows, though, reversing course on established foreign policy could prove the most difficult path for any of them. Obamas first executive order sought to close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp within a year, a task that remains incomplete more than six years later., For Obamas White House, a Hillary Rodham Clinton administration would clearly represent the best hope for continuity in mission. Speaking with reporters in between meetings at the Capitol with congressional Democrats, Clinton, Obamas former secretary of State, called the agreement an important step that puts the lid on Irans nuclear program., We have to treat this as an ongoing enforcement effort, which I certainly strongly support and, as president, would be absolutely devoted to ensuring that the agreement is followed, she said., Republicans sought to add Clintons fingerprints to the pact, noting its roots in her tenure in Obamas Cabinet. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement that the agreement will cement the Obama-Clinton foreign policy legacy: a richer, more powerful, more dangerous, legitimized Iran., Clinton said she still had concerns about Irans trustworthiness, noting that it remained a state sponsor of terrorism and poses an existential threat to Israel, among other concerns., That bad behavior is something we have to address, she said., Under the deal, Iran will accept restrictions on its nuclear activities, including inspections to verify that it is following the terms of the accord. In exchange, the U.S., Europe and the United Nations will agree to lift sanctions that have had a crushing effect on Irans economy., Jake Sullivan, a top policy advisor to her campaign and at the State Department, focused during a breakfast with reporters Tuesday on what he said was Clintons central role in building the global sanctions coalition that created the negotiating leverage to bring Iran to the table, and in starting the diplomacy that has resulted in what happened today., Sullivan, who was sent after Obamas reelection to begin back-channel talks with Iran, also said it was up to any potential presidential candidate to lay out a strategy on Irans nuclear program that will make the United States safer, reduce risk and increase the likelihood that all of this plays out in a positive way., Obama acknowledged the role a future president would play as he presented the deal Tuesday morning from the White House, arguing that the absence of a deal would mean a greater chance of more war in the Middle East and that the agreement would improve U.S. standing in the region., I have no doubt that 10 or 15 years from now, the person who holds this office will be in a far stronger position with Iran, further away from a [nuclear] weapon and with the inspections and transparency that allow us to monitor the Iranian program, he said., The presidents ambitious policy changes late in his administration, combined with conservatives deep animosity toward him, have made it difficult for Republican presidential candidates to distinguish their visions as anything other than reactions to the Democratic incumbent., James Carafano, vice president of foreign and defense policy studies for the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Obama put Republicans in a difficult position. The president implemented a deal that, Carafano said, posed major long-term risks for Middle East stability while suggesting for now that he had tackled a major problem., Republicans have little to gain by making definitive statements about how they would address the Iran deal while in office, Carafano added., This is the danger of running for president, he said.

{"Content": "[[, The House vote to sue President Obama is the first such legal challenge by a chamber of Congress against a president and a historic foray in the fight over constitutional checks and balances., Wednesdays nearly party-line vote followed a feisty floor debate and offered a fresh example of how the capitals hyper-partisanship has led both parties into unprecedented territory, going to new and greater lengths to confront one another., Two years ago, the Republican-led House became the first to hold a sitting Cabinet secretary in contempt of Congress, after lawmakers accused Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. of defying their request to turn over records about the Fast and Furious gun-running operation conducted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives., Last year, the Democratic-controlled Senate changed the bodys long-standing filibuster rules in response to what they said was blatant obstruction by the minority GOP of presidential nominations, including the first-ever filibuster of a nominee for Defense secretary., Novembers election could further exacerbate tensions in Washington, especially if Republicans  who already hold the House gain control of the Senate. They need a net gain of six seats to do so., The House approved the resolution in a near party-line vote, 225 to 201. It authorizes House Speaker John A. Boehner to file suit in federal court on behalf of the full body to seek appropriate relief for Obamas failure to enforce a provision of the Affordable Care Act that would penalize businesses that do not offer basic health insurance to their employees., That provisions effective date has been delayed by the administration twice and now wont fully take effect until 2016. The GOP-led House has voted to repeal the law, even as it seeks to sue Obama for failing to enforce it., When he unveiled the suit, Boehner insisted it was about more than just Obama. This isnt about Republicans and Democrats. Its about defending the Constitution that we swore an oath to uphold, and acting decisively when it may be compromised, Boehner said Wednesday., Lou Fisher, a constitutional scholar, said the House vote was a new iteration of the push-and-pull between the executive and legislative branches dating to the nations founding. Never before had either the House or the Senate sought to challenge a presidents authority in the courts., Traditionally, such disputes have been handled through political trade-offs or, in the most extreme cases, the impeachment process outlined in the Constitution. In 1834, the Senate voted to censure President Andrew Jackson, although Fisher said the legitimacy of that step was questioned and it was later expunged., Whether the lawsuit will become a new normal may depend on how it plays in November. Maybe that will be the test  who gets hurt more from this? said Fisher, a former analyst on the separation of powers for the Congressional Research Service., Individual members of Congress have sued presidents before. A special House panel has also represented the body in other lawsuits, most recently before the Supreme Court on the Defense of Marriage Act. The House or a House committee can sue an executive agency or White House officials to seek documents or testimony, since the House has an independent authority to investigate., But Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.), a former judge, said the latest suit introduced a host of new legal questions. Do you really want to cede to the courts the authority to resolve disputes between the branches? he asked. Would you want the president to sue the House for missing a budget deadline? How would it end?, Legal experts note that the Supreme Court has previously refused to get involved in political spats between Congress and the president, and for that reason the House lawsuit is expected to fail., But Rep. Richard Nugent (R-Fla.) insisted that the House needed to make a stand and defend the Constitution. He cited Obamas own words as a senator challenging President George W. Bush for making \"laws as he goes along., Democrats called the suit a political stunt and defended Obamas use of his executive powers, blaming congressional inaction and gridlock., They warned that the House suit could be the first step toward impeachment, something that has become a staple of campaign messaging for the party and already generated millions in online donations., Speaking on the House floor, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) noted how she, after being elected speaker in 2007, faced enormous pressure to launch impeachment proceedings against George W. Bush over the Iraq war. She said Boehners statement that the GOP had no plans to impeach the president did not go far enough. She questioned the use of the Houses time even on the lawsuit resolution., It is yet another Republican effort to pander to the most radical right-wing voters at taxpayers expense, she said., House Democrats used some of the time allotted for debate to press Republicans instead to allow votes on various proposals they say would boost the middle class., David G.

{"Content": "[[, The immigration debate in the 2016 presidential campaign unfolded along familiar lines: Republicans called for greater border security and Democrats called for expanded rights for those in the country illegally., All that changed one blue-sky day at Pier 14 on San Franciscos world-famous Embarcadero. A 32-year-old woman was killed July 1 while strolling with her father near the Bay Bridge, allegedly by an immigrant with a lengthy rap sheet who was back in the country despite repeated deportations., The death of Kathryn Steinle scrambled the political equation overnight, throwing immigration reform advocates on the defensive, fueling the anger of hard-liners and causing even supporters of San Franciscos liberal politics to pause and consider its status as a \"sanctuary city\" that generally refuses to turn over immigrants to federal law enforcement officials., Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump gestures to supporters before his campaign tripto Laredo, Texas.He has been among the most vocal critics in denouncing the Obama administrations immigration policy in the wake of the San Francisco shooting death., Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump gestures to supporters before his campaign tripto Laredo, Texas.He has been among the most vocal critics in denouncing the Obama administrations immigration policy in the wake of the San Francisco shooting death., Democrats, notably Hillary Rodham Clinton, sought to strike a delicate balance, continuing to embrace a liberal immigration policy that is a top priority for their base while acknowledging that something went terribly awry in San Francisco. Republicans seized upon the tragedy as visceral proof of their contention that the Obama administrations failure to secure the border has left Americans unsafe., The topic is fraught for the GOP, which needs to improve its standing with Latinos  a crucial and fast-growing bloc of voters  who have been alienated in the past by harsh rhetoric about immigrants living in this country illegally. At the same time, it also offers an opportunity to make inroads with moderate voters who may support the legalization of some immigrants but cannot fathom how a man with the suspects record was ever freed to wander this citys streets., NEWSLETTER:Get the days top headlines from Times Editor Davan Maharaj >>, \"Its a powder keg,\" said Republican consultant Rob Stutzman. \"People who are very sympathetic to Dreamers, to people being treated fairly, are confounded by why the hell we cant keep criminals either in prison or the other side of the border.\" (Dreamers refer to people brought to the country illegally as minors.), Theres considerable finger-pointing over who bears responsibility for the release of Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, the felon who has been charged with killing Steinle. But political discourse  in the nations capital, on talk radio and cable television, and on the campaign trail  has mostly focused on what responsibility San Franciscos status as a sanctuary city bears in the tragedy., Several Republican candidates called for the federal government to punish the more than 200 jurisdictions that have declared themselves sanctuaries, which were created in part so that immigrants could cooperate with law enforcement without fear they would be deported., Describing Steinle as a \"precious young woman\" who was failed by the system, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said that certain federal funds should be denied to jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with immigration authorities., \"If its an act of defiance against the federal government, then they shouldnt take federal law enforcement money,\" Bush told reporters Thursday after visiting an online firm in San Francisco., Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said that, if elected, he would reverse President Obamas executive orders that allow some who are in the country illegally to remain here, while former Texas Gov. Rick Perry called for using either executive order or congressional action to force sanctuary cities to provide immigration officials access to their prisons and holding facilities., Last week, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) introduced legislation that would require state and local agencies to notify immigration authorities when they arrest and detain anyone in the country illegally. Federal prison officials would also be required to give precedence to transfer requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement over state and local authorities. Agencies that do not comply would forfeit some federal funding., The House of Representatives voted Thursday, largely along party lines, to approve similar legislation., Donald Trump, the businessman who kicked off his presidential bid last month with rhetoric labeling Mexican immigrants rapists and drug dealers, has seen his standing in the polls rise as he has hammered the issue. He has also been among the most vocal about Steinles killing., \"This man, or this animal, that shot that wonderful, that beautiful woman in San Francisco, this guy was pushed back by Mexico,\" Trump told CNN this month. \"Mexico pushes back people across the border that are criminals, that are drug dealers.\", Some Republicans fear that Trumps inflammatory words are hijacking what could have been a productive dialogue about immigration policy., \"There could have been a very nice, thoughtful discussion,\" said Hector Barajas, a GOP operative in Sacramento who recently acquired half a dozen piatas that look like Trump. \"Now what it has become is a sideshow.\", On the Democratic side, Clinton voiced support for the concept of sanctuary cities while blaming San Francisco officials for not cooperating with the federal government., \"Heres a case where weve deported, weve deported, weve deported,\" she said on CNN. \"He ends back up in our country, and I think the city made a mistake.\", The following day, her campaign released a statement reiterating the candidates support for sanctuary cities and comprehensive immigration reform., Former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley appeared to criticize Clintons stance but did not mention her by name., \"Local governments should not be blamed for the federal governments inability to fix our broken immigration system, nor should they be held responsible for doing the federal governments job,\" he said., Homeless at the time of his arrest, Lopez-Sanchez pleaded not guilty to murder in the shooting and is being held in lieu of $5-million bail. He is a seven-time felon who has been deported to his native Mexico five times., When Lopez-Sanchez, 52, finished serving a federal prison sentence in March, he was turned over to San Francisco on a 20-year-old bench warrant for a $20 marijuana sale. Prosecutors declined to file charges., Immigration and Customs Enforcement asked to be notified prior to his release, but city officials did not comply because Lopez-Sanchez did not meet their criteria, set in 2013, for turning over people to immigration officials. He was freed., In a jailhouse interview with KGO-TV, Lopez-Sanchez admitted to accidentally shooting a gun he found. He also said \"he knew San Francisco was a sanctuary city where he would not be pursued by immigration officials,\" according to KGO., In California, the matter could affect two of the states top Democrats  Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who both support sanctuary cities. Newsom was mayor of San Francisco and Harris the citys district attorney in 2008 when an immigrant, who was in the country illegally and had felony juvenile convictions, killed three people. Harris is a candidate for the states open U.S. Senate seat next year, and Newsom is running for governor in 2018., Several San Francisco residents interviewed near the site of the shooting said they were sympathetic to people living in the U.S. illegally, but they couldnt understand how Lopez-Sanchez was released., \"He came in the country five times illegally. Something obviously needs to be changed there,\" said Jeffrey Yip, a 32-year-old Democrat. The software developer walks to Pier 14 and sits gazing at the bay during work breaks.

{"Content": "[[, The job: Bill Dombrowski is president of the California Retailers Assn., a trade group based in Sacramento that includes most of the countrys largest store chains, including 7-Eleven Inc., Safeway Inc., Macys Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Home Depot Inc., For the last 20 years, hes crafted political and legislative strategies for the association, whose members generate more than $570 billion in annual sales and employ nearly 2.8 million people. The association has clout at the Capitol despite its small staff of five., Midwest upbringing: Dombrowski, 59, grew up the youngest of eight children in a Polish American family in Stevens Point, Wis., current population 27,000. His father, Leo, was a janitor at St. Peter Catholic Church. His mother, Philomen, worked at a baby furniture factory after his father died when Dombrowski was 16. \"There was no childhood left. We all had to chip in to cover the debts,\" he recalled., Higher education: Dombrowski graduated with a journalism degree from the University of Wisconsin in Madison in 1976. A year later, he and future wife Susan dumped their record collection in the back seat of a Dodge Dart and headed for Los Angeles., Time to work: Dombrowski found several jobs in Southern California before becoming a spokesman for Carter Hawley Hale, an L.A. retailing conglomerate, which owned the Broadway, Neiman-Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, among other department and specialty stores., The company spent years fighting off takeover attempts before selling assets, seeking bankruptcy protection and eventually liquidating in the mid-1990s., As the company crumbled, Dombrowski, then 39, leveraged his connections with the retailers association to become the organizations president. The family with two sons, Chris, now 28 and a political campaign consultant, and Thomas, now 25, a law student, moved to Sacramento., Big issues: Dombrowski became the retailers political guide as California businesses struggled to cope with deregulation, immigration and globalization., One of the first challenges he faced was a scandal involving near-slavery conditions for Thai garment workers at an El Monte sweatshop in 1995. \"It was horrible,\" he said. \"We were also victims. We were deceived, but we assumed responsibility for a financial settlement.\" Dombrowski backed subsequent successful legislation tightening regulations on garment sewing operations., In 1996, the retailers supported a pioneering electricity deregulation bill that turned into a fiasco. The states biggest utilities nearly collapsed financially. Rolling blackouts in 2000 and 2001 contributed to the recall of then-Gov. Gray Davis. \"It all sounded great with the free market,\" he said. \"But electricity is very complicated.\", A decade later, Dombrowski and so-called bricks-and-mortar stores won one of their most important legislative victories: a deal that required Internet retail leader Amazon.com and many other major online sellers to collect sales taxes on purchases made by Californians., \"It had to be done,\" Dombrowski said. Amazon \"had grown to be so big.... It already destroyed the book industry and was going after home furnishings.\", In 2013, retailers lost a round, failing to stop the Legislature from hiking the minimum wage to $10 an hour by 2016., Biggest lesson: Dombrowski said he learned the sharp difference between right and wrong from the Sisters of Joseph, his teachers at a parochial school in Stevens Point. As a result, he said, he always tries to be honest, especially in the rough-and-tumble political world of the California statehouse., \"I tell people exactly what Im thinking and what I want to do,\" he said. \"Im stunned how many times people dont believe me.\", marc.lifsher@latimes.com, Twitter: @MarcLifsher]", "Date": "20140420", "Title": "[How I Made It: Bill Dombrowski, California Retailers Assn. president]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-himi-dombrowski-20140420-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, The last few weeks have seen momentous decisions in America  especially the Supreme Courts decisions on same-sex marriage and Obamacare., By the hundreds, readers of The Times have offered their opinions. There was approval and there was disagreement in generally thoughtful prose. A number of viewpoints were expressed, rationally., But its also campaign season. And on the stump, with a chance to look presidential, some of the candidates came across as something, well, lacking -- at least to a number of Times readers., --Sara Lessley, Letters to the Editor department, Lorraine Knopf in Santa Monica observed:, After the Supreme Courts decision on same-sex marriage, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas called for a constitutional amendment to allow voters to remove Supreme Court justices from office through periodic judicial retention election., Wouldnt it be ironic if that went through, and the voters removed justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito?, In Encino, Stan Gordon was puzzled:, I am having difficulty following the logic of Mike Huckabee and his ilk., As Huckabee said recently: \"This case wasnt so much about a matter of marriage equality, it was marriage redefinition. And I think people have to say, If youre going to have a new celebration that were not going to discriminate [against], may I ask, are we going to now discriminate against people of conscience, people of faith who may disagree with this ruling?\", So because others choose not to follow the dictates of Huckabees belief system, their difference of theology is an attack on the governors faith and he is being denied his own religious freedom. Huh?, I also find it bizarre that they use the term conservative when they spend so much effort regulating other peoples business., Stephen Hogg in Simi Valley sent a wry prediction:, I read that several of the Republican hopefuls are pledging to defy the Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage., I expect that Mississippi will impose a 72- hour waiting period; Wisconsin will require an ultrasound; and Texas will require all ceremonies be at a hospital., Larry Selwitz in Newport Beach observed:, Following the Supreme Courts ruling on gay marriage, Bobby Jindal, as well as many other conservatives, lost no time in responding that marriage between a man and a woman was established by God and no earthly court can alter that., Somehow, Gov. Jindal failed to recognize the irony that an all-powerful God can change his mind if he so pleases -- as he did last week by decreeing that the Court should rule in favor of gay marriage., Reacting to Donald Trumps recent comments about immigration, John T. Chiu in Newport Beach counseled patience:, The brouhaha over Donald Trumps comments on illegal immigrants from Mexico will do no more or less damage to the GOP than what Leland Yee and some of his errant Democrats in the state Senate have inflicted on the Democratic party., Over the years, many have regarded Trump as nothing more than an attention-getter and rarely taken him seriously. On the other hand, his demand on collecting data on crimes committed by illegal immigrants should not be ignored simply because this would violate Political Correctness. A well-done study on this subject will either confirm or debunk such assertions., Trump should be seen as a modern-day court jester, who does, however, sometimes utter the unpalatable truth., In San Bernardino, Thomas McGovern is waiting :, Trump is offering the GOP presidential candidates an opportunity to demonstrate leadership. At this point, they have all failed., Being president requires a lot of tough decisions., Ducking such an easy call on Trumps racist rant shows that none of them have what it takes., Dan Aaron in Fountain Valley commented:, Donald Trumps recent pronouncements have made it clear that the largest state in the country is Trumps ego., And in Newbury Park, Matt Singerman is watching...:, Why should we be surprised about Trumps recent hateful statements about Latino immigrants? It certainly wasnt his first foray into hate speech. It wasnt that long ago that Trump was an ardent supporter of the \"birthers,\" in demanding that President Obamas produce his birth certificate., Unless the GOP is more forceful in denouncing Trump, he could turn out to be the biggest land mine stepped on by the Republican party since the Watergate break-in.]", "Date": "20150706", "Title": "[Don't forget about the candidates; 2016 is coming on fast]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/readersreact/la-le-0706-readers-react-20150706-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, The leading Republican presidential candidates used their first face-to-face encounter to accuse celebrity candidate Donald Trump  and one another  of diverging from conservative principles as they tried to reverse the surprising dominance of the billionaire and gain a foothold in the crowded race., Trump made news Thursday before even uttering a single word. When a moderator asked candidates whether they would pledge to support whoever ultimately won the partys nomination for president, as well as rule out an independent bid, Trump raised his hand to indicate he wouldnt., I want to win as the Republican. I want to run as the Republican nominee, he said. But when pressed, he repeated, I will not make the pledge at this time., Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who had promised to mix it up at the debate, was quick to attack Trump, saying he was already hedging his bets because hes used to buying politicians., Trumps surprise ascent has complicated an already unruly Republican field, and debate officials separated the 17 candidates into two tiers to provide some order to the lineup at Quicken Loans Arena, home of the NBAs Cleveland Cavaliers., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, The top 10 candidates, ranked based on national polls, took the prime-time stage  with Trump at the center  before a crowd of 5,000. Seven others tangled earlier on the same stage for what some called a happy hour forum., For most Americans who have not immersed themselves in the machinations of an election still more than 15 months away, it was the best look yet at the Republicans hoping to prevent a third consecutive Democratic presidential term., Mostly the contenders shared common promises to unravel many of President Obamas signature accomplishments and push the country rightward. They vowed to stop the nuclear agreement with Iran, reverse Obamas immigration actions and be tougher on terrorism., Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who had been seen as the partys most likely nominee earlier in the campaign, sought to regain his footing after comments on immigration, womens health and the Iraq war made him a target for both the left and right., I governed as a conservative, and I govern effectively, he said. We left the state better off because I applied conservative principles in a purple state the right way, and people rose up., He also carefully broached the questions of Trumps ascent., Mr. Trumps language is divisive, Bush said. Were going to win when we unite people with a hopeful, optimistic message., Trump, though, made no apologies and doubled-down with an attitude that has become increasingly familiar. We dont have time for tone. We have to go out and get the job done, Trump said., With such a crowded field, the candidates tried to make the most of their few minutes in the spotlight, skipping over Trump, as Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker did, to focus on their own messages., If this election is a resume competition, then Hillary Clintons going to be the next president because shes been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight, Rubio said. This election better be about the future, not the past. It better be about the issues our nation and the world is facing today, not simply the issues we once faced., Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who barely qualified for the main debate as the candidate in 10th place in national polling, said Trump had hit a nerve among Americans, and those who want to just tune him out, theyre making a mistake., Now, hes got his solutions. Some of us have other solutions, he said, before discussing his record as a governor and congressman., Because Republican primary voters tend to be older and more conservative, the candidates did not shy from polarizing stances, particularly on social issues, pledging to defund Planned Parenthood and not give the Supreme Court the last word on gay marriage., A bottle of Wite-Out, is what former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, on the second-tier stage, promised to bring to his White House, to undo many of Obamas actions., Im tired of the hyphenated Americans, said Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. Immigration without assimilation is an invasion., The only woman on either stage, Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive who lost the 2010 race for the U.S. Senate in California and appeared in the preliminary debate, outshined her rivals with crisp attacks on Bush and Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton., We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring, said Fiorina, a copy of whose remarks were found earlier in the day in a hotel printer., Trump had tamped down expectations before his debut, saying he did not have as much experience debating as others. But his overbearing presence dominated the night., Hes tapped into an anger that people feel. Theyre sick of politics as usual, Fiorina said. Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on healthcare and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?, In the prime-time debate, Trump sparred with moderator Megyn Kelly of Fox News Channel, who asked him whether his past comments calling women fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals made him unelectable, particularly if he was pitted in the general election against Clinton., I frankly dont have time for total political correctness, he said. Its fun, its kidding, we have a good time. If you dont like it, Im sorry., Paul and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie engaged in perhaps the nights most bitter exchange, on whether Americans civil liberties were violated by government surveillance programs, as the Kentucky senator believes., When Paul said he wanted to collect records from terrorists, not innocent Americans, Christie called it a ridiculous answer and accused him of just blowing hot air on the issue for political convenience., The back-to-back events are a product of the Republican National Committees efforts to regain some measure of control over the debate process after 2012, when many in the party thought the endless string of televised events ultimately worked against it and the eventual nominee, Mitt Romney., As the GOP candidates traded barbs, Clinton was in California, where she participated in a Los Angeles roundtable discussion on healthcare and in fundraisers in L.A. and San Francisco. Democrats announced their first debate would be held Oct. 13., Thursdays debate was among a dozen in the run-up to next years primary elections, and Steve Duprey, chairman of the Republican Partys debate committee, expects the complications will eventually smooth out., I wouldnt be a bit surprised by the next debate if some of the folks who arent in the main debate now are, and vice versa, he said.

{"Content": "[[, The Los Angeles Unified Board of Education voted unanimously Tuesday to back a tentative labor agreement that would give teachers a 10% raise over two years  their first pay increase in eight years., The agreement would fund smaller classes and more counselors and soothe several months of labor tensions  including talk of a strike in the nations second-largest school system., \"This is a family in LAUSD. Sometimes, as a family does, they fight,\" said board President Richard Vladovic as he stood with board colleagues and union leaders to announce the vote. \"But we have come together as one.\", Alex Caputo-Pearl, president of United Teachers Los Angeles, hailed the agreement as a victory for students, educators and the community. \"This is a fair agreement that brings us closer to the schools that L.A. students deserve,\" he said., The tentative three-year deal would cost $875.3 million for all employees, about $285.6 million more than the districts original offer, according to a memo from Supt. Ramon C. Cortines to board members. Included in the increased amount is an additional $31.6 million for other employee groups, such as administrators, whose contracts entitle them to more money if other bargaining units negotiate better deals than their own., The memo estimated that the agreement, along with a multibillion-dollar plan for districtwide health benefits the board approved last week, would create a deficit of $559 million by 2016-17., Board members said they were relying, in part, on more state education dollars to bridge that projected gap. The states recovering economy and surging tax revenues are likely to bring \"several billions more\" than projected to California schools, a state legislative analyst told a district budget committee this month. L.A. Unified generally receives about 11% of all state school dollars, Vladovic said., \"We absolutely can pay for this,\" said board member Steve Zimmer, adding that district savings and near-certain increased state revenues would cover at least the first two years of raises., But board member Monica Ratliff said program cuts and layoffs would need to be considered if state funding falls short., The agreement comes after months of escalating union actions under the leadership of Caputo-Pearl. The union staged rallies, faculty meeting boycotts and even set aside millions for a strike fund  to push the district to improve its original offer of a 2% increase for 2014-15 and a onetime payment of 2% for the previous year. The union had initially asked for a 17.6% raise over an unspecified time period., Caputo-Pearl said the union actions \"changed the dynamics\" of the bargaining process by energizing his members and strengthening their position., Other highlights of the tentative agreement:,  $13 million to reduce class sizes in eighth and ninth grades.,  $13 million for new counselors to reach a ratio of 500-1 next school year.,  A Health Services Task Force to seek ways to increase nurses, counselors and social workers.,  A revised teacher evaluation system to be jointly developed by the district and union.,  Caps on class sizes., The board vote sends the agreement to the unions 35,000 members for action; if they ratify it, the board will move to approve it., teresa.watanabe@latimes.com]", "Date": "20150421", "Title": "[L.A. school board backs tentative teachers pact with 10% raise]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-lausd-settlement-20150422-story.html", "Author": "[Teresa Watanabe]"}
{"Content": "[[, The mission on Saturday was simple: Appeal to some of the wealthiest Republican Jewish donors in the country. The method was direct: Heap lavish praise on Israel, with an ample serving of disparagement for President Obama., And so they did -- two GOP presidential hopefuls, a third possible White House contender and an Ohio senator facing a potentially tough reelection fight back home., Texas Sen. Ted Cruz: \"Sadly, the American friendship and alliance with Israel has never been more imperiled than it is right now today under this administration.\", Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry: \"Ignoring the lessons of history, our president aims to sign an agreement with a nation that is the worlds largest state sponsor of terrorism, the Islamic Republic of Iran.\", Indiana Gov. Mike Pence: \"Im a Christian, a conservative and a Republican and I support the Jewish state of Israel.\", Ohio Sen. Rob Portman: \"I see a world that is more dangerous than anytime since 9/11 . I also see a president unwilling to lead.\", The setting was a chandeliered ballroom at the Venetian Resort, an Italianate edifice on the Las Vegas Strip and the business headquarters of gambling magnate Sheldon Adelson. The audience was nearly 800 members of the Republican Jewish Coalition, who responded lustily to the serial attacks on Obama and on a proposed nuclear deal with Iran and to repeated, avid pledges of devotion to Israel., \"The love for Israel, the passion for defending and standing with Israel: That goes through the heartland and every corner of this country and cities large and small,\" said Pence, drawing one of the days several standing ovations., The three-day annual gathering, which began Thursday, has become something of a command performance for GOP presidential hopefuls, not least because Adelson, a major benefactor and one of the worlds richest men, is also one of the most prodigious donors in American politics., (He was absent from Saturday mornings session, the only one open to media coverage, choosing to sample the visiting political luminaries behind closed doors.), Adelson spent about $100 million in the 2012 election and has indicated plans to issue a blizzard of checks again in 2016; the $15 million alone he spent on Newt Gingrichs failed presidential bid was enough to keep the former House speaker running long after his political viability had passed., For that reason, Adelsons support is among the most coveted prizes sought by Republicans eyeing the White House., Cruz, who spoke first, winkingly acknowledged the expectations placed on the courting candidates., \"It is not complicated for Republican politicians to come to the RJC and say, We should stand with Israel. Unless youre a blithering idiot, thats what you say when you come here,\" Cruz said to knowing laughter and a smattering of applause. \"For anyone that doesnt get that, we have medical treatment available.\", Each of the speakers was scathing in assessing a preliminary deal that would lift economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits on the countrys nuclear program, an effort to stop development of a nuclear weapon. \"A terrible, terrible deal,\" Cruz called it., The struggle, then, was how to stand out in a field of White House prospects all saying, essentially, the same thing., Cruz, a Senate freshman who declared his presidential candidacy last month, said the test was past performance. He cited a litany of pro-Israel legislation he helped enact., \"I joined with New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand in offering a resolutioncondemning Hamas use of human shields, women and children, as a war crime,\" he said, referring to the Islamist movement. \"And it passed both houses of Congress unanimously.\", Perry, who iseying his second try at the White House, outlined a hawkish foreign policy that included vows to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and a pledge to support added construction within settlements on the disputed West Bank., Pence, a former House member who has been mentioned as a long shot prospect for 2016, touted his friendship with Eric Cantor, a Jewish Republican and favorite of the organization, who rose to the second-ranking position in the House before his upset defeat in a primary last year., Although the harshest rhetoric was reserved for Obama, the Democrats 2016 front-runner, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, did not go unscathed., Cruz at one point attacked the \"Obama-Clinton foreign policy.\" Perry mentioned Clintons March 2009 presentation of a reset button to Russias foreign minister, a gift-wrapped token jokingly intended to symbolize new and better relations between the two longtime adversaries., \"If only we had known she was going to reset us back to the Cold War,\" Perry scoffed, vowing to make Obamas policy toward Russia and the aggression of President Vladimir Putin an issue in 2016., There was no obvious crowd favorite, though Cruz received perhaps the most enthusiastic response when he addressed a moderators question about the difference between himself and Obama, who also ran for president as a freshman senator., \"President Obama is not a lousy president because he was a senator,\" Cruz said tolaughter and applause. \"President Obama is a lousy president because he is a radical ideologue and zealot, and the ideas he believes have been profoundly dangerous to the United States and the world.\", Last year, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey, John Kasich of Ohio and Scott Walker of Wisconsin made the trek to this desert metropolis to audition before Adelson and others ranking among the GOPs biggest political givers., This year, Perry and Cruz spoke during the public part of the gathering while two other prospective White House contestants were welcomed to try out in closed sessions: South Carolina Sen.

{"Content": "[[, The mood among Democrats on Capitol Hill soured as details of a $1.1-trillion spending bill confronted them Wednesday with the reality of their eroding political leverage., Elections have consequences, Democratic negotiators said as they spent much of the day defending the deals they cut with Republicans, saying it was the best they could do., \"I say to my colleagues: Stay steady; stay strong,\" said Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), the chief Democratic negotiator on the huge bill that will fund most government departments through the end of September., \"You know, sometimes you give a little, you take a little,\" she said., As is typically the case with must-pass money bills, the current appropriations measure, which is necessary to prevent a government shutdown, not only sets spending levels but also includes a host of substantive provisions tacked on by influential lawmakers., Democratic leaders said they had stopped dozens of Republican proposals -- to restrict abortions, loosen rules on mountain-top coal mining, enable ivory imports and expand gun rights -- in return for the ones they did agree to., They said that compromise was tough, but that leaving decisions to next year, when Republicans will have a majority in both houses, would have been worse for Democratic priorities., Those arguments did not soothe critics of the 1,603-page bill that is making its way toward a House vote on Thursday, with the Senate expected to follow by weeks end., A coalition of liberal lawmakers, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), made a last-minute pitch to change a provision of the bill that would weaken financial regulations., The measure would loosen rules on certain types of financial swaps by banks -- deals that were at the heart of the 2008 financial meltdown. The rules were adopted under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law and have been a major target for Republicans., \"The American people did not send us here to work for Wall Street banks,\" said Warren, a potential 2016 presidential contender. \"They sent us here to work for them.\", Warren and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, urged the House to delete the provision before Thursdays vote., But changes at this stage, with just days remaining before Congress is set to recess for the holidays, seem unlikely., Democrats arent the only ones upset. The bill fails to stop Obamacare or the presidents move to shield from deportation up to 5 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally., As a result, some conservative Republicans will not vote for it, meaning that House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) will need some Democratic votes to pass the package., That gives Democrats some leverage, but only a limited amount., Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) called two provisions of the package \"deeply troubling\": the effort to weaken the financial swaps rule and a separate provision that would triple the amount of money donors can contribute to political parties., \"We must get them out,\" she said., But it was unclear whether Pelosi would try to block any Democrats from supporting the bill. Last summer, 70 House Democrats voted for a separate piece of legislation that would have weakened the swaps rule., What may have been more alarming for Democrats than the provisions in the bill was the preview it offered of GOP priorities for next year., Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the incoming Republican majority leader, has made it clear he hopes to fight the Environmental Protection Agencys regulations on coal and the Dodd-Frank financial services overhaul, as well as Obamacare and the administrations recent move to shield up to 5 million immigrants from deportations., Democratic leaders realized this was their best chance to cut a deal before Republicans take control., Republicans underscored that point. Had he been at the negotiating table, \"it would have been open season on Dodd-Frank,\" said Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee., Still, the deal is a tough one for Democrats to accept. Half of the package goes to military spending, under previously agreed-to spending caps, with the remainder for other domestic accounts., New money goes largely overseas -- to fight the Ebola crisis and Islamic State militants., Many domestic programs will see cuts -- including a $60-million reduction to the EPAs budget, which will cut funds by 21% since 2010, when Republicans took control of the House., The package guts some other Democratic priorities: Regulations to limit sodium in school kids lunches were blocked; money to pursue endangered status for the sage grouse was scrapped; and there will be no funds for high-speed rail, including the line being developed between San Francisco and Los Angeles., Still, said an aide to Mikulski, whatever the Republican Congress would have produced next year would be \"10 times worse\" for Democrats., \"We knocked so many bad things out of this,\" the aide said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations., For the latest from Congress follow @LisaMascaro]", "Date": "20141210", "Title": "[Democrats sour over government funding bill with Republican priorities]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-congress-money-20141210-story.html", "Author": "[Lisa Mascaro]"}
{"Content": "[[, The most important battle in politics today is the one within the Republican Party, and the tea party movement didnt start it. The GOPs civil war began in 1912 when Teddy Roosevelt made progressivism the governing philosophy of the Republican establishment., For the 102 years since, the conflict has been between limited-government constitutional conservatives and the proponents of big government  and the big spending that goes with it., It has been waged with conservative Republicans, such as Sens. Robert A. Taft, Barry Goldwater and Jesse Helms, on one side, and big-government Republicans, such as Presidents Eisenhower, Nixon and Ford and New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, on the other., Many thought, wrongly, that the conservatives won with the election of Ronald Reagan and his coalition of economic, national defense and social conservatives. But todays Republican establishment frequently invokes Reagan while also pursuing a progressive agenda at odds with his principles. Big-government Republicans today include Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker John A. Boehner, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus., Make no mistake, the establishment GOP is not the political home of conservatives., To understand todays battles, and the rise of the tea party movement, one must understand that the tea party is as much or more a rebellion against the entrenched leadership of the Republican Party as it is a reaction to specific policies of President Obama. Conservatives have learned that establishment Republican leaders are not merely incapable of stopping the progressive agenda but have been complicit in its expansion. GOP leaders have talked a good game when they are up for election, but they all too often vote for, or refuse to fight, the funding of most big-government programs., The lesson for conservatives? We have been pointing our political guns at the wrong target., Conservatives are not going to get to the political Promised Land and be able to govern America according to conservative principles until flawed, big-government Republican leaders are replaced with constitutional conservatives. And the people are with us. For example, Gallup reports that 72% of respondents to a 2013 poll said that \"big government is a greater threat to the U.S. in the future than is big business or big labor, a record high in the nearly 50-year history of this question.\", The place to stop the progressive agenda is first within the GOP. Conservatives have finally come to realize that the fate of the presidents agenda for his final two years will actually be decided in Republican primaries. The Obama agendas fate lies with conservatives such as Sens. Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and Mike Lee, and Reps. Tom McClintock, Justin Amash and Tim Huelskamp, who have defeated Republicans of a progressive bent in the primaries and gone on to win general elections., We are already seeing an alliance of big-government interests, such as the Republican Main Street Partnership, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Facebook billionaire Mark Zuckerberg, joining forces to tilt upcoming Republican primaries in favor of big-government GOP candidates. Long term, this alliance can be devastating to Republican political prospects., Through all the ebbs and flows of the GOPs 100-year civil war, the levers of power within the Republican Party have remained firmly in the hands of a progressive elite that sees big government as often inefficient but not wrong. The GOP establishment never seems to learn that going along with big-government policies is exactly what gets Republicans thrown out of office and relegated to the status of the powerless minority that they were for the better part of 50 years, from the New Deal until the election of Reagan in 1980., However, the election of young, principled constitutionalists to Congress and in state legislatures is a sign that this civil war for the soul of the Republican Party is about to turn. The alternative is that the GOP will slide ever deeper into irrelevance as the party of \"dime-store Democrats\" that President Truman derided so accurately in the 1950s., Richard A.

{"Content": "[[, The most prized credential of Hillary Rodham Clintons political director may not be her connections on Capitol Hill, her experience courting the crucial Latino vote or the diversity she brings as the child of a Mexican immigrant, but her run for office  which she lost., Last year, Amanda Renteria returned home to Californias Central Valley to run for Congress and got crushed. The race in the heavily Latino district exposed blind spots in Democratic strategy with Latino voters, who largely stayed home. The message for Clinton in her 2016 presidential run was clear: The gains Democrats had been making among Latinos could stall anytime., Now, as Clintons political director, Renteria is putting the campaigns vast resources to work avenging the 2014 midterms, when Democrats were unable to mobilize the coalition of minority voters that had helped elect President Obama twice., \"It is really time for Latinos to understand who is with them and who is not,\" Renteria said during a break from the National Council of La Raza conference in Kansas City, where she was working the hallways before Clinton addressed a packed ballroom. \"One of the real opportunities in a presidential election is to truly have a message that can break through, even in the little towns where I grew up.\", Clintons massive Latino outreach machine is unprecedented for this stage in a primary. Most Latinos dont even know the name of Clintons closest challenger for the Democratic nomination, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, according a new Univision poll., Yet about 500 days before the general election, the outreach effort overseen by Renteria is running on all cylinders. Some of it is clearly visible, with the candidates aggressive positioning on immigration, her much-talked-about Nevada round table with \"Dreamers\"  immigrants brought to the country illegally as children  and an economic agenda targeted at empowering minorities., But in an election in which the Latino vote is likely to be decisive, its the on-the-ground work that could pay the biggest dividends., \"You cant take it for granted,\" Clarissa Martinez de Castro, a deputy vice president at La Raza, warned attendees of a session at the conference. \"Some people are like, Hey, Im good, so they will vote for me even if I dont do anything. No. Youve got to get out there.\", Renteria, who grew up in the hardscrabble town of Woodlake, near Visalia, went on to become the first chief of staff of Latino descent for a U.S. senator, when she worked for Michigan Democrat Debbie Stabenow. Under Renterias direction, Clinton organizers are showing up in Latino and other minority communities in a variety of ways., Often its not even to talk much politics. Renteria, 40, recalls a recent networking event at a bar in Philadelphia where the millennials who showed up wanted to discuss career strategies, how to go about paying off student loans and what her family thinks of what she is doing with her life. So they did., \"It is not just about come vote for me, but  how can I help?\" said Renteria, who disarms with a rare mix of a candidates charm and an operatives urgency. \"We have the resources in this election to talk about it.\", Renteria talks without the pretension common in the inner circle of presidential campaigns. She can carry on a conversation with the apolitical. Many in Washington cant., Clintons campaign is burning through an eye-popping $230,000 per day in this stage of the campaign, and much of it is going toward making contact with voters more aggressively than is the norm so early on, whether it be through hiring field organizers with community ties, investing in the newest microtargeting technology or holding events like the one in Philadelphia., The Clinton team is scouting for consultants in every state with a large Latino presence to develop localized strategies for boosting turnout. Buzz-stirring events like the Dreamers gathering Clinton held in Nevada in early May are conceived with input from local activists., They are all the campaigning tasks Renteria was unable to do when she ran for Congress., \"With the hand she was dealt, she did the best she could,\" said Mark Salavaggio, a Central Valley political analyst. \"It did shock people that she lost by so much.\", Her opponent, Rep. David Valadao (R-Hanford), relentlessly pounded Renteria, then a staffer on Capitol Hill, as a carpetbagging Washingtonian. \"She is not one of us,\" several of his mailers shouted., Valadao, who was concluding his first term in Congress, benefited from a Latino-sounding last name, despite his Portuguese ancestry, which made his accusations that Renteria was the interloper in a district heavy with migrant farmworkers sting all the more to her., She recalls how her family would sometimes not get served at Dennys until after the white customers, how she sat in a chair for hours at a Border Patrol station as agents grilled her parents, how she proudly danced as a child in the traveling Ballet Folklorico., \"It means a lot to us in the Latino community to have someone like Amanda at the table making decisions  and making sure the community is at the table,\" Rep. Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.) said., Rep. Xavier Becerra of Los Angeles, also a Democrat, said Clintons appointments of Renteria to one the campaigns most senior jobs and of Lorella Praeli, a Dreamer, to be the director of Latino outreach, resonated deeply among Latino leaders. \"Those are the decisions that make you feel like [Clinton] is one of us,\" he said., GOP strategists say Renterias race in California was not a fluke, but a reflection of a wall Democrats are about to hit nationally with Latino voters., \"The idea that if you just bring out more Latinos to the polls you will win is a big mistake, and one I hope Democrats continue to make,\" said Mike Madrid, a Republican consultant in California. \"Amanda Renteria was running in an area where Latinos tend to be very conservative. They are similar to what the Latino voters will look like in Colorado, New Mexico, rural Virginia and a lot of battleground states.\", Republicans are hopeful that 2016 will be the year they achieve what they last did in 2000, when George W. Bush, a Texan with a knack for Spanglish and a firm grasp of border culture, was able to slow the surge of Latino support toward Democrats. He also attracted strong Latino support in his 2004 reelection., This year, Bushs brother Jeb, a former Florida governor, speaks even better Spanish and his wife is a native of Mexico. Another Floridian seeking the GOP nomination, Sen. Marco Rubio, is the child of Cuban immigrants., Even so, the Univision poll and others show neither of those contenders is gaining the kind of traction among Latinos that George W. Bush did when he ran against Al Gore, whose patrician demeanor did not play well., Hard as Republicans try to cast Clinton in the same mold, it is proving a tougher sell. When Clinton last ran for president, in 2008, two Latinos voted for her for every one who voted for Barack Obama in the Democratic primaries., \"Everyone has the abuela who ran the show when it came to dinner, giving you a hard time about school, or how you treated your parents,\" Renteria said, using the Spanish word for grandmother. \"That strong woman you look up to in the Latino community.... There is a lot in the community we see in her.\", evan.halper@latimes.com, Twitter: @evanhalper]", "Date": "20150719", "Title": "[Hillary Clinton's political director brings key lessons from her own (losing) campaign ]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-clinton-political-director-20150719-story.html", "Author": "[Evan Halper]"}
{"Content": "[[, The mother arrived at the hospital last week in need of an emergency caesarean section, saying she had crossed the border to run an errand in town, not so her baby would be born an American citizen., She assured the doctor that she arrived at the hospital just \"because [she] was here.\", Dr. Rolando Guerrero listened skeptically. \"They always have a story,\" he said after delivering her 8-pound boy, Dylan., Doctors here at Starr County Memorial Hospital deliver about 30 babies a month, including those of mothers in the country illegally, hospital officials said. In this county in the heart of the impoverished Rio Grande Valley, so-called anchor babies have been delivered for decades, some to women who have already settled in Texas, others to those who crossed the river expressly to give birth on U.S. soil., \"About six months ago I got one who was literally still wet from the river,\" Guerrero said., Sometimes pregnant Mexican women arrive at the nearby border bridge. \"Theyll find a Border Patrol agent on the banks and say, I need help, because they know theyre going to get the care,\" said Dr. Javier \"Jake\" Margo Jr., president of the local medical society. \"Its a strain on the physicians and the smaller hospitals.\", The phenomenon has become a focus of the Republican presidential battle, with both Jeb Bush and Donald Trump questioning the motives of immigrant mothers who give birth after traveling to the U.S. And some residents complain that the children are a drain on taxpayer-supported social services., But the issue is often not so black-and-white here. Many families have relatives scattered on both sides of the border, and people often live and work across the mostly unmarked line as if it werent there., \"Theyre part of our community,\" Guerrero said of the expectant mothers he sees., NEWSLETTER:Get the days top headlines from Times Editor Davan Maharaj >>, Starr County Memorial is a modest red-and-gray brick building with 44 beds, a family clinic and an emergency room, taxpayer-funded through a hospital district., Just how many Mexican mothers come to give birth to the babies and the cost of caring for them are unclear., \"They do come on purpose,\" said Thalia Munoz, chief executive of Starr County Memorial. \"We have to absorb the costs. Its a persistent problem. Its a fact: They come over here for the anchor baby, they come over for the benefits.\", The doctors dont ask whether patients are in the country legally, though they do ask expectant mothers to provide a local address, in part because they are required by state law to test newborns for genetic diseases and follow up. \"Most of them do have an address. Whether its a real address or not, who knows,\" Guerrero said., Expectant mothers who live in Texas  whether they are legal residents or not  qualify for a state program providing prenatal care. If the mothers cant pay for deliveries, Medicaid pays doctors and the hospital a portion of the cost., Mothers lacking documentation do not qualify for Medicaid afterward, but their babies usually do, doctors say., Medicaid payments to doctors here have declined by half in the last decade, they say  to about $550 for a vaginal delivery; $600 for a caesarean section. Medicaid compensated the hospital about 40 cents on the dollar, Chief Financial Officer Rafael Olivares said., As a result, the hospital picks up more of the cost of the care of people in the country illegally., Rio Grande Valley hospitals reported more than $131 million in uncollected medical bills as of 2013, the most recent year available, according to the Texas Hospital Assn. They dont tally how much of that is for people in the country illegally., Margo pointed to a map on their office computer showing the Rio Grande River, which lies just across the nearby highway., When Mexican drug cartel and gang violence escalated across the border about a decade ago, he could hear automatic gunfire from his home. Pregnant women would arrive at the bridge at night, complaining that they couldnt find a doctor willing to see them after hours because of the violence., \"Those werent technically anchor babies  they tried to deliver over there,\" Margo said., The doctors said they saw fewer women coming to have babies after Texas officials ordered a surge of law enforcement and National Guard troops to the border last summer in response to an influx of Central American immigrants. Instead of gunfire at night, Margo heard U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Department of Public Safety helicopters., But since then, \"slowly, its been going back up,\" Guerrero said., Many of the women that he and other doctors see are poor, but others are not, and some of them have crossed the border legally. Professionals from Mexico  doctors, dentists and graduate students  will schedule caesarean sections at a U.S. hospital, paying for the services, sometimes in cash, the doctors said., Guerrero recalled a Mexican dentist who crossed the border so her delivery would be paid by Medicaid, which she qualified for because she was born in the U.S. \"She should have paid for it. You work for a living, you have the money. I guess it goes to character,\" he said., The political battle over the babies has grown more intense. In May, a group of immigrant parents illegally in the Rio Grande Valley filed a federal lawsuit against Texas officials who they allege refused birth certificates to their U.S.-born children. The suit is pending., At Starr County Memorial, most of the mothers the doctors see do not cross intentionally to give birth, they said  they were already living on the U.S. side of the border with families of mixed status. \"I have families where Ive delivered three or four\" U.S.-born babies, Guerrero said., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, For Mexican Americans living in the region, many with relatives on both sides of the border, the phenomenon creates mixed emotions  sympathy but also resentment of people they believe are taking advantage of the system., Guerrero grew up working at a tortilleria and produce-packing shed. He has worked at the hospital for 15 years. His colleague Margo has worked here 11 years. Both say they have stayed because they are dedicated to the community. Both are fourth-generation sons of Tejano families who lived here back when it was Mexico. They didnt cross the border  it crossed them., They attended school with U.S.-born children whose parents lived in Mexico and asked only for one benefit from the U.S. government: their childrens education. \"Thats how it used to be. They were over there and they werent taking advantage,\" Guerrero said., But over the decades, government benefits have grown for American-born children, including Medicaid, the Women, Infants and Children program, and food stamps. After Guerrero delivered Dylan, his mother received formula at the hospital supplied by WIC., Both doctors say they would like to see the border better secured, although Guerrero noted that deporting families already living on the Texas side of the border would probably lead to \"upheavals\" and \"ill will.\", Nothing about the border is as simple as it seems., When Guerrero went to check on Dylans mother  who asked to be identified by only her first name, Crystal  she repeated the story of how she ended up accidentally giving birth in the U.S., She had dropped off her children with her husband, who works legally in Texas. Crystal, 32, had intended to drive east on the U.S. side of the border  as many do to avoid dangerous Mexican highways frequented by smugglers  before crossing to see a doctor in Reynosa. She had her medical paperwork with her. The birth of her baby in the U.S. was unintentional, she said., The doctor  originally skeptical  believed her., Securing the border, Guerrero said, is \"bigger than the anchor babies.

{"Content": "[[, The national Republican Party has awarded one of its sanctioned presidential primary debates to California. Well, hot Huckabee! Better enjoy., Its likely to be the closest this state gets to the 2016 presidential race. In presidential politics, were a spectator state in the nosebleed seats., Even if California does offer up more voters than any other state, were mired in the backwater, far off the main ship channel to the White House., Theres an exception, of course, for the relatively wealthy few capable of donating generously to a candidate. These bankrollers are coddled and charmed. But the millions of ordinary folks are snubbed and taken for granted., Im not even talking here about California being shut out of the nominating process because the national parties allow spoiled and pipsqueak states  Iowa, New Hampshire and other brats  to begin voting ridiculously early. The nominees are decided long before Californians are permitted to choose sides in June., But so be it. Were hopelessly stuck at the back of the primary line., What Im griping about is the undemocratic general election winner-take-all system used by all but two states  Nebraska and Maine  of awarding electoral votes. The Founding Fathers never set it up this way. The Constitution doesnt even mention the words Electoral College., The Founders, in fact, were skittish about direct democracy. They didnt trust all the people. Women and slaves werent allowed to vote. Senators originally were chosen by state legislatures., The constitutional framers merely decreed that the president be chosen by state \"electors.\" Legislatures could appoint electors by any method they chose., What we have today evolved sordidly from states  especially slave states  jockeying for power leading up to the Civil War. Theres nothing at all holy about it., The winner-take-all system is bad for two reasons., First, as weve seen, a candidate can receive the most votes nationally and still lose in the Electoral College. Democrat Al Gore was supported by 544,000 more voters than Republican George W. Bush in 2000. And if there was ever proof that whoever wins the most votes should become president, the Bush administration provided it. But lets not get into that here., In all, four presidential candidates have won the most votes but lost the presidency., Second, under a winner-take-all system, the vast majority of states are shunted to the sidelines, forced to watch from afar as the candidates fight it out in a few battleground states., Thats because candidates wont waste their time or money campaigning in states where theyre a cinch to win everything anyway or are sure to be shut out. In California, since 1992, no Democrat can lose, and no Republican has a prayer. So you can already add Californias 55 electoral votes  20% of the number needed to win the presidency  to the Democratic column in November 2016., The GOP, however, is throwing us a bone. The party has sanctioned nine primary debates, and the second will be held at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley next Sept. 16. You can watch it on CNN., State Republican Chairman Jim Brulte, in a prepared statement, called it \"a testament to the role California will play in the upcoming 2016 election.\", Nice try, Jim., Brulte knows better than most that the only real role California will be playing is as a money exporter., In 2012, President Obama and Republican Mitt Romney bagged $137.8 million in California. And the grand total they spent on advertising here: $320. Thats no typo., Neither candidate held one general election campaign event in California  or in 37 other states. Only 12 states saw any events. And 96% of the 253 events were held in eight battleground states. Nevada, with only six electoral votes, had 13 campaign stops and $55 million spent on it for ads., For three-fourths of the states, it was a total snub., These figures come from Fair Vote, a nonpartisan group trying to reform the system so that every vote counts., Its a simple idea that doesnt require a constitutional amendment., States form a compact that obligates each to cast all its electoral votes for the candidate who wins the national popular vote. The compact wouldnt go into effect until signed by enough states to make up a majority of the Electoral College votes., People must get over the notion that states should elect a president. Citizens should elect their national leader, as they do governors and members of Congress., So far, 11 states have inked the compact. They possess 165  or 61%  of the necessary 270 electoral votes. These states come in all sizes  small, medium and large., California signed up in 2011. New York was the latest last April. The focus now is on Oregon, Connecticut and Delaware. Theres hope of electing by popular vote in 2020., \"Early on, legislatures didnt want to spend time on something that seemed pie in the sky,\" says John Koza, a Silicon Valley computer wizard who came up with the idea. \"Now were getting closer and approaching another presidential election, and thats generating interest.\", When Gov. Jerry Brown signed the compact bill, he commented: \"It seems logical that the occupant of the White House should be the candidate who wins the most votes.

{"Content": "[[, The nations gasoline supply likely will have more ethanol in coming years  but not as much as was required by federal law., The Obama administrations proposed renewable fuel standard wont have much of an impact on gas prices, but could become an issue in the 2016 presidential elections, especially in farm states that have profited over the years from higher corn prices linked to the use of corn-based ethanol. Campaigning in Iowa, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton has called for a robust renewable fuels standard., The proposed standards also represent a blow to renewable fuel companies that have pushed to keep high volumes of their product flowing into drivers gas tanks., The 2007 renewable fuels law tried to address global warming, reduce dependence on foreign oil and bolster the rural economy. It required a steady increase in the amount of renewable fuels like corn-based ethanol blended into gasoline over time. The new proposal would reduce the amount required by more than 4 billion gallons in 2015 and by more than 3 billion gallons the following year., The agency said the standards set by the law cannot be achieved, due partly to limitations on the amount of non-ethanol renewable fuels that can be produced. Next-generation biofuels, made from agricultural waste such as wood chips and corncobs, have not taken off as quickly as Congress required and the administration expected. There has also been less gasoline use than predicted, the Environmental Protection Agency said., Still, the targets would represent an overall increase in the use of renewable fuels over time. EPA officials said the new requirements would drive growth at an \"ambitious but responsible\" rate., \"We believe these proposed volume requirements will provide a strong incentive for continued investment and growth in biofuels,\" said EPAs Janet McCabe., The lower targets are better news for the oil industry, which has fought the existing law. Oil companies say they would prefer that the market determine how much ethanol is blended into their gas., Tom Buis of the ethanol industry group Growth Energy accused the EPA of siding with the oil companies., \"It is unfortunate that EPA chose to side with the obligated parties who have deliberately refused to live up to their obligation to provide consumers with a choice of fossil fuels or lower cost, higher performing, homegrown renewable energy at the pump,\" Buis said., In a bid to ethanol producers, the administration also announced Friday that the Agriculture Department will invest up to $100 million to help improve infrastructure for delivering ethanol to cars, such as fuel pumps capable of supplying higher blends of renewable fuel.]", "Date": "20150529", "Title": "[EPA proposes lowering requirements for ethanol in gas]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hy-epa-ethanol-20150529-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, The New Year brings a great many revered traditions: fitness resolutions, \"Auld Lang Syne,\" the descent of the crystal ball in Times Square., That list does not include, at least for most people, the onrush of the next presidential campaign. Even so, with the dawning of 2015, the race for the White House moves into full swing, meaning a steady parade of candidates trooping through Iowa and New Hampshire, with only the occasional side trip to the Bay Area and Los Angeles to raise money to fly back to resume campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire., This pattern elicits no end of outrage and unhappiness in California, almost entirely among lawmakers and political activists who wish they were the ones being coddled and stroked by those who would be the next Leader of the Free World., The argument  irrefutable from a mathematical standpoint  is that California is far more populous than early-voting Iowa and New Hampshire and, thus, deserves considerably more attention than those pint-sized states. (Throw in the two others granted a privileged place at the start of the election calendar, Nevada and South Carolina, and California still tops their combined populations by more than 25 million people.), For years, California tried to boost its clout by pushing its primary earlier in the nominating process. That, in turn, prompted other states to advance their elections, resulting in Iowa kicking off the last two presidential campaigns with caucuses held just three days into the New Year., Ho ho ho., In 2012, California finally gave up, moving its presidential primary all the way back to June. That ensures at least a year of griping about how shamefully overlooked the state has become  save for candidates coming to extract cash  and a good deal of hand-wringing over the vital California issues that are supposedly getting short shrift., Which doesnt really stand up to scrutiny., There are certainly a handful of parochial issues that receive inordinate attention thanks to the time lavished on the pampered people of Iowa and New Hampshire. Ethanol, a boon to Iowa farmers, is perhaps the best  and, from a taxpayer standpoint, most costly  example., And more than a few candidates have been known to prostrate themselves to please Iowa or New Hampshire audiences, the latest being New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who ignored overwhelming sentiment at home to please Iowa farmers by vetoing a bill regulating the care of pregnant pigs., But the truth is that modern presidential campaigns have become every bit as nationalized as the ubiquitous franchise restaurants that can be as readily found in Des Moines and Manchester, N.H., as Burbank, Reno or Columbia, S.C., The questions put to candidates in Iowa living rooms, New Hampshire town halls and, especially, in the debates nationally broadcast from the lead-off states tend to be ones that Californians and, for that matter, voters around the country care about most: jobs and the economy, education, immigration, foreign policy, the proper size and role of the federal government., Whenever theres a hot topic  the debate over police conduct, say, or cyber-harassment from North Korea  it is just as likely to come up in Laconia, N.H., as it is in Long Beach., Of course California, like every state, has its unique set of issues., The proposed bullet train through the Central Valley, to name one, or Gov. Jerry Browns bid to build massive water tunnels under the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, to cite another. Good luck, though, getting any Democratic presidential hopeful to weigh in on either proposal., \"Thats a matter for Californians to decide,\" theyre likely to say, rather than risk offending the governor over his pet projects. (For Republicans, its easier  and more predictable  to simply tee off in opposition.), Theres a good case to be made for starting the presidential selection process in a set of smaller states, where any candidate with a strong constitution, personal appeal and compelling message can build support one intimate question-and-answer session at a time., California is simply too spread out and the cost of advertising too obscenely expensive for all but the most richly funded candidates, or those starting with the highest name-identification, to stand any chance of seriously competing., Its not a perfect system., But there are worse things than turning on the TV to watch a presidential debate without first having to burrow through a 10-foot wall of snow., Happy New Year., mark.barabak@latimes.comTwitter: @markzbarabak]", "Date": "20141228", "Title": "[Feeling left out in the Golden State as presidential campaign heats up]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-pol-california-poliics-20141228-story.html", "Author": "[Mark Z.

Koch says he and his brother, Charles G.

(Yes, Santorum is still in the running  thanks in large part to the generosity of Friess.), The biggest mega-donor of them all, Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, is still playing hard to get. All the candidates, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, are courting him., Theres something grotesque about a process that requires serious politicians to hover anxiously around a few donors who can make or break a campaign at whim., And no, this isnt a rant about the Republican Party. I have no doubt that plenty of Democratic candidates would do pretty much the same thing. It just happens that theres not much of a contest yet on the Democratic side this year  but a wide-open race on the GOP side, and that has brought the .01% out to play., The race for big money is bigger this year than in previous cycles for another reason: Campaigns are still discovering how they can exploit the freedom from regulation that the Supreme Court has granted since its Citizens United decision in 2010., Most of the new money is being funneled through single-candidate \"super PACs\": fundraising committees set up to promote individual candidates. That was a new and experimental idea when President Obama and Mitt Romney first tried it in 2012, but now everybody has one. Cruz has four, each one directed by an individual mega-donor. Hillary Rodham Clinton has at least two., On paper, a super PAC, which can take unlimited donations, cant coordinate what it does with a candidates official campaign committee. In practice, there are plenty of ways around that rule. Bush, for example, just put his super PAC in the hands of Mark Murphy, who has worked for him in past elections; Murphy wont have much difficulty figuring out what his television commercials should say, even if he cant attend meetings at campaign headquarters., But super PACs wont just help a candidate amplify his message; theyll also help determine who gets to be a candidate in the first place. A candidate with a billionaire in hand has a guaranteed place in early primaries even if he has neither grass-roots nor party support. (Think Newt Gingrich in 2012.) On the other hand, a candidate without billionaires may not be able to run a viable campaign at all. (Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent Vermont socialist, said that problem is weighing on him as he considers whether to run.), Campaign finance reform has historically been a low priority for most Americans. When the Pew Research Center asked voters in 2012 to rank their concerns, campaign finance was near the bottom., This year could be different. Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg says public alarm is rising, and hes advised candidates to put reform on their list of promises (as Clinton did last week)., Its too late for significant changes this cycle. A constitutional amendment to reimpose contribution limits, which Clinton suggested she favors, would take years to pass. Democrats have proposed legislation to increase disclosure and provide federal matching funds for small donations, but their bills have stalled. Republicans have said theyd support more disclosure if all contribution limits were abolished, but that proposal isnt moving either., If, however, voters demand change from the candidates, its just possible that 2016 could be remembered as the year the tide of money crested, instead of just another campaign that saw the dollars rise. Meanwhile, maybe we should ask for an interim measure. Instead of debates among the candidates, lets go straight to the top  and ask for debates among their donors instead., doyle.mcmanus@latimes.com, Twitter: @doylemcmanus, Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinionandFacebook]", "Date": "20150421", "Title": "[For the GOP, it's the billionaires' primary]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0422-mcmanus-politics-megadonors-koch-20150422-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, The news that Sen. Barbara Boxer would not run for her Senate seat again after nearly four decades in public life was a watershed moment for California and for her fellow Democrats, signifying the end of a political career that has come to embody Bay Area liberalism., Her announcement also set off a scramble among state politicians who have been waiting for a California Senate seat to open for more than two decades., Boxer, 74, stated her plans Thursday in a video to supporters, saying her decision was not prompted by her age or by partisan bickering in the nations Capitol, where Republicans now control both houses., I am never going to retire  the work is too important, but I will not be running for the Senate in 2016, she said, adding that she would remain engaged through her political action committee and on behalf of fellow Democrats. I want to come home to the state that I love so much: California, she said., The move was not a complete surprise. Boxer had not been raising money for a reelection campaign, as rumors abounded that she wanted to spend more time with her family and had grown weary of the long commute to Washington. The announcement sparked a deluge of gushing statements from fellow Democrats., Barbara Boxer is more than a senator  shes an institution, said President Obama. Shes served the people of California for more than three decades with distinction, fighting for the issues that are close to their homes and hearts., Though short of stature  and often accompanied by an aide carrying a Boxer box for her to stand on at news conferences  Boxer has not been a demure presence on Capitol Hill. She has advocated vocally on behalf of environmentalists, organized labor and womens rights groups., Her Senate career was forged at a crucial time for women in politics. In 1991, Boxer  then a member of the House  was among the seven lawmakers who marched up the steps of the male-dominated Senate and demanded that a vote on the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court confirmation be postponed so accusations of sexual harassment against him could be investigated., The protest instigated the televised hearings that nearly sank Thomas. It also triggered a national backlash against the Senate that created openings that swept Boxer, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and others into office in 1992, the year of the woman in American politics., In the 1992 race, Boxer beat conservative television personality Bruce Herschensohn by 4.9 points after a last-minute revelation that he patronized a Hollywood strip club. In every Senate election since, Boxer beat her rival by double digits, most recently former Hewlett-Packard chief Carly Fiorina in 2010., Boxer told reporters Thursday that she did not believe she would have been elected to the Senate in her first run without the Thomas investigation. I  did this long shot for the Senate, never believing I would win.... And then Anita Hill happened, she said. Without Anita Hill, that story, I dont think I would have made it., Feinstein, who spoke with Boxer by phone shortly before the announcement, reflected on that time Thursday. Everyone said it couldnt be done; thats what made it a moment, Feinstein told reporters on Capitol Hill., Boxer and Feinstein have had similar positions on legislation, but Boxers combative style has made her a target of the right and has not always been conducive to deal-making: Few landmark laws bear her name., When the GOP took over Congress in 1994 and began rolling back environmental laws, Boxer launched into a three-day filibuster. She has sparred with arch-conservative Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania over abortion rights., Her testy exchanges with former National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice were parodied on Saturday Night Live. Her scolding of a general who addressed her as maam instead of senator enraged her critics., Boxer rattled Capitol Hill with her crusade for an open investigation into allegations of unwanted sexual advances by former Sen. Bob Packwood, an Oregon Republican. Many voters were appalled by what they learned about the ways of the Senate as a result., Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), then chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee, was so annoyed by Boxer that he responded to her charge that he lacked ethics by saying: Being called unethical by Barbara is like being called ugly by a frog., Boxer irked colleagues again in 2004, when she challenged the electoral college votes from Ohio, where some Democrats alleged fraud. She was the only senator to do so. The move delayed certification of George W. Bushs reelection for several hours., But the senator also played the inside game sometimes. She collaborated with Republicans to push through multibillion-dollar infrastructure measures. She took a lead in securing funding for the hard-fought expansion of the Los Angeles subway and other key transportation projects., Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a second-term Democrat from Minnesota, noted in an interview that when few other major bills advanced in the last Congress, Boxer negotiated a major water bill and transportation package with Republican Sens. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma and David Vitter of Louisiana. Those are no small tasks, Klobuchar said. Im sure a lot of people are talking about her passion and her work for liberal causes. But in fact she had an uncanny knack to be able to deal with and positively work with incredibly conservative members of the Senate., Inhofe and Boxer are polar opposites on the issue of climate change. As they prepared to spar at a hearing scheduled for Halloween in 2007, Boxer brought costumes  angel garb for her, devil horns for him., Inhofe, who took over the chairmanship of the Senates Environment and Public Works Committee from Boxer after control of the Senate changed hands this year, said he may have no closer friend in the Senate than Boxer after 28 years of serving together in the House and Senate., We have a respect for each other and weve always been able to keep things light and happy, and yet do battle, he said. I know you dont believe this  nobodys going to believe this when they read it  but Im going to miss her., Boxer said the failure to pass a climate bill has been one of her greatest regrets. The other was not doing more to stop the Iraq war, which she voted against., I used to come down there [to the Senate Floor] and read the names of the dead, she told reporters. I couldnt change things. And that just weighs on me. I wasnt able to gather enough support in the Senate. It took us a long time. We finally got there., Born in Brooklyn, Boxer attended Brooklyn College and worked as a stockbroker and a journalist before being elected to the Marin County Board of Supervisors in 1976. Running with the slogan Barbara Boxer Gives a Damn, she was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982., In her video Thursday, Boxer made clear that although she would be leaving the Senate, she had no plans for a life of leisure. Although I wont be working from my Senate space and I wont be running in that next tough race, as long as there are issues and challenges and strife, I will never retire because this is the meaning of my life, said Boxer, who is known for working whimsical verse into her speeches., Twitter: @LATSeema, Twitter: @evanhalper, Mehta reported from Los Angeles, Halper from Washington.

{"Content": "[[, The Pentagon would get $585 billion next year under the Obama administrations proposed budget, reversing a five-year decline in military spending and blowing past mandatory spending caps imposed by Congress. , The plan would give the Pentagon a base budget of $534 billion in fiscal 2016, about $38 billion more than this year, with an additional $51 billion for the expanding U.S. military campaign against Islamic State forces in Iraq and Syria. , Pentagon officials say the money is needed to enable the military to counter violent extremists in the Middle East, shift more military assets to the Asia-Pacific region, address a resurgent Russia in Ukraine, and invest in cyber-security and new weapons technology., \"The proposed budget helps ensure we can manage risk and meet near-term defense needs while preparing for the future,\" Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said in a statement. \"However, it represents the minimum resource level necessary to remain a capable, ready and appropriately sized force able to meet our global commitments.\", The plan is likely to face stiff resistance in the Republican-controlled Congress, partly because it exceeds mandatory spending caps by $36 billion that are set to take effect this spring. , Obama has repeatedly asked Congress to void the so-called sequestration cuts that took effect across the entire government in 2013 after lawmakers failed to reach a compromise to avert them., Pentagon budget documents argue that a return to sequester-level funding would be irresponsible and dangerous, resulting in a force too small and ill equipped to respond to the full range of potential threats to the nation., Many Republicans are eager to appropriate more money to the military, but are expected to demand equal cuts elsewhere in the federal budget to offset any increased spending, which the White House would oppose. The issue is likely to spark a sharp debate between defense and deficit hawks in the months ahead., The Pentagon also has set up a fight with Capitol Hill by proposing to close more military bases around the country., The issue is contentious because lawmakers in both parties ardently seek to protect military families, businesses and defense contractors in their districts even as they force the Pentagon to cut costs overall., It has been 10 years since the last round of domestic base closures and the Pentagon argues it now has a surplus of military facilities that should be shut down., In another proposed cut likely to face criticism, the Pentagon wants to phase out the A-10 Warthog attack plane., The low-flying, heavily armored aircraft was developed in the early 1970s primarily to destroy Soviet tanks. Its supporters in Congress have beaten back previous attempts to kill it despite possible savings of $3.5 billion., Defense officials argued Monday that base closures and program cuts are necessary to preserve more important military capabilities and to keep weapons systems that are vital to U.S. interests., \"Like it or not, America remains the global first security responder of choice,\" Deputy Defense Secretary Robert O. Work told reporters at the Pentagon. , \"All this money has to come from somewhere, so even at the presidents budget level, its a constant Rubiks Cube trying to figure out what is the best mix of capabilities, capacities and readiness,\" Work said. \"We think this is the right budget.\", Critics on Capitol Hill wasted no time in blasting the budget as fiscally reckless., \"The president is asking for billions in additional spending without any realistic way of paying for it, said House Appropriations Chairman Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), The Southern California aerospace industry stands to benefit if Congress actually approves the plan. Spending for weapons would rise 15% to $108 billion next year, and research and development would grow 10% to $70 billion., About $11 billion would purchase 57 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jets, which are assembled in Fort Worth, Texas. But many of its parts come from about 300 companies in California. , In addition, the Air Force proposes to spend $1.2 billion for a new long-range strike bomber that is being developed by engineers at Lockheed Martin Corp. and Northrop Grumman Corp. in Palmdale., The Air Force also wants 29 MQ-9 Reaper drones costing $821 million.

{"Content": "[[, The pop-pop-pop of a white police officers gunshots. A black 18-year-old killed on a street in his own neighborhood., Angry black residents  tired of poverty, tired of getting pulled over, tired of being fined for frivolous traffic stops  finally hit their breaking point as Michael Brown lay in a pool of blood for hours in the summer sun., Officer Darren Wilsons shooting of Brown after a struggle in the street was only the first chapter of a saga with no end in sight., A year later, Browns death and the ensuing protests that engulfed the predominantly black St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Mo., have changed hundreds of lives and unleashed a national debate on race and policing that continues to dominate headlines today, while Ferguson quietly struggles forward., \"Things have changed, a lot,\" said David Whitt, a 35-year-old father of three who lives in an apartment complex near where Brown was killed. But, Whitt said, \"the issue still remains that somebody was killed by police, and people say, We havent got justice.\", The shooting  and the clashes with riot police that followed for days  radicalized a cadre of millennials who have helped turned the slogan \"Black Lives Matter\" into a national movement that is now exerting pressure on the 2016 presidential campaign., A Department of Justice investigation found Fergusons municipal justice system functioned like a modern-day debtors prison, driven by racial profiling and ticketing and jailing poor residents. The findings led to statewide reforms and deeper national conversations about the effects of incarceration., \"We are making progress,\" said Jerryl Christmas, a St. Louis-based defense attorney who represents several activists arrested during demonstrations in Ferguson over the last year. \"A lot of issues have been raised and a lot of conversation is going on, but we still need more action.\", Lengthy federal and grand jury investigations found that Wilson had done nothing criminal. But now police shootings around the country receive intense scrutiny as public officials reevaluate policies and push for body cameras in hopes of keeping their community from becoming another Ferguson., The nation saw what happened in Ferguson and attitudes changed, with surveys showing a sharp increase in the number of whites who now agree with what black Americans have long been saying: Race is still a problem in America., But in Ferguson, as activists stage events to mark the anniversary of Browns death Sunday, ache mixes with optimism as the city has tried to stagger back to normal, or toward something better than normal, with mixed results., \"I think were going to come out of this, and eventually were going to come out of it even stronger, in my opinion,\" said Wesley Bell, one of two black members newly elected to the formerly white-dominated Ferguson City Council., The charred husks of businesses burned down by arsonists after the grand jurys decision in November not to indict Wilson have been swept away. Some shops on West Florissant Avenue, once the site of nightly clashes between demonstrators and police, have seen customers return along with the calm., \"Were starting to get back into the swing of things, people starting to come slowly but surely,\" says Antonio Henley, a barber and the owner of Prime Time Barber Shop, which experienced a \"tremendous\" loss of business when protests began. \"We were down 20, 40, 50% when it first happened. But we survived.\", Near the Canfield Green apartments, a memorial plaque has replaced a pile of signs and stuffed animals that marked the spot where Brown died. But Whitt said there are some in Ferguson who would just as soon forget what happened last August., \"Theyre trying to erase this memory of this tragedy that happened right here in Canfield,\" Whitt said., Change has also come to the city government, though nothing resembling the revolution many protesters sought., After a Justice Department report revealed racist emails sent by city officials, several resigned. Now Ferguson has a new interim police chief and a new interim city manager, but it still has the same mayor, James Knowles III, who is white, and who has resisted calls to step aside., The six-seat City Council had only one black member before Browns shooting. Now it has three, after an April election in which voter turnout more than doubled, but in which activist-backed candidates largely failed., City officials remain locked in negotiations with Department of Justice officials pushing for a consent decree that would probably reform the citys Police Department, a potentially pricey move at a time when city revenue has dropped because of the unrest., The city fell $3 million below its projected budget for the last fiscal year, largely due to $1 million in expenses related to the street protests and rioting and to a roughly $1.1-million drop in revenue from tickets handed out by officers, City Councilman Mark J. Byrne said. Unfair ticketing practices were a main focus of a Justice Department investigation., Byrne said the city had already implemented reforms to its municipal court system to cut down on the number of warrants and fines handed out. \"I think were on the right path on everything  we just have to get it done,\" Byrne said of justice reforms., Between January and June, the city handed out nearly $300,000 in fines, down dramatically from more than $900,000 over the same period last year, according to figures provided by the citys media office., \"We dont see as many traffic stops as we normally see all day every day,\" said Henley, the barber., Thomas Harvey, executive director of ArchCity Defenders, a nonprofit group that seeks an overhaul of St. Louis County municipal court systems, says that Fergusons new municipal judge, Judge Donald McCullin, has brought a more humane touch to the court, treating people with respect., Nonetheless, Harvey added, \"it doesnt change the fact the people are being pulled over and ticketed for essentially what amounts to being poor and black.\", Also, Ferguson is just one small town surrounded by other small towns with their own police departments and their own municipal courts and with many of the same problems., \"If you ask a person who lives in St. Louis County whats different, theyll say nothing,\" Harvey said., Browns parents have filed a lawsuit in hopes of holding Wilson accountable for the death of their son, and many activists remain angry at Wilson despite investigators doubts that Brown had his hands up when the officer killed him, as some Canfield residents said., In a recent interview with the New Yorker magazine, Wilson, who has since left the Police Department, said he was still careful where he ate dinner, and hinted that his own reality, like St. Louis County itself, had become informally segregated, for his own safety., \"We try to go somewhere  how do I say this correctly?  with like-minded individuals,\" Wilson told the magazine. \"You know.

{"Content": "[[, The presidential campaign got fully underway this last week with a flurry of announcements, road trips and rallies that will roll across the country with increasing intensity for the next year and a half., Most of what grabs headlines in the coming campaign will have little or no impact on who wins, past experience has shown. But underneath the hoopla, two clashing realities will shape what is likely to be a close and hard-fought battle., Democrats will be trying to win a third consecutive presidential election, a difficult task made harder by the fact that by almost 2 to 1, Americans continue to believe the country is on the wrong track, polls show., Republicans will be trying to win with a base of supporters that is roughly 90% white in an increasingly diverse country, having failed so far to develop a strategy to attract the growing minority populations who rejected them in 2008 and 2012., Who wins will almost certainly depend on which proves more powerful  the hunger for change or the inexorable demographic wave., Or to put it another way, the 2016 election will test whether the Obama coalition of minorities and white liberals can hold together, turn out and defeat the aging but still powerful coalition of social and economic conservatives and foreign policy hawks assembled by Ronald Reagan 35 years ago., The best case for Republicans is that \"the American public seldom has the stomach for a third term, and President Obama hasnt been the kind of leader who generates a third term,\" said political scientist Julia R. Azari of Marquette University in Wisconsin., The two presidents in the modern era whose parties did win three or more elections, Reagan and Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt, both transformed American politics by embodying  and helping bring about  a change in what people believed government should do., Obama has not accomplished that. As a result, Azari said, for Hillary Rodham Clinton  or another Democratic nominee if she stumbles  its hard to \"talk about the Obama legacy\" because its not clearly defined., Obama came into office with hopes of leading the country toward a new acceptance of activist government. Some Democrats hoped, for example, that successful implementation of the Affordable Care Act would cause Americans to warm toward the expanded government role in guaranteeing health coverage it represents., Obamacare by now has helped more than 20 million Americans get insured, the biggest increase in coverage in half a century., Contrary to dire warnings from the laws opponents, healthcare costs have not shot upward  the rate of healthcare inflation is the lowest in years  the job market has improved and the cost to the federal government is below forecasts., Despite those successes, the country remains sharply divided on the law. American views of the Affordable Care Act have improved a bit in recent months  43% disapproved and 41% approved in the most recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation in March  but mostly, opinions have been stuck about where they were when Congress first passed the bill in 2010., Rather than changing the nations close partisan divide, the healthcare law appears to have reinforced it., Broader measurements also find continued widespread skepticism about government., Last year, a poll by the Pew Research Center found 51% of Americans felt that \"government is doing too many things better left to business and individuals,\" compared with 45% saying \"government should do more to solve problems.\" The number on the conservative side has grown during Obamas tenure., Combine those sentiments with the continued, decade-long feeling that the country is on the wrong track, and 2016 would seem a good year for a Republican presidential bid., Maybe. The degree to which voters want change depends heavily on the state of the economy, said John G. Geer, political science professor at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. As economic news has improved, so have Obamas poll standings, and Democratic chances in 2016 will rise to the extent that trend continues, he said., Moreover, even if views of governments role have not shifted, something else has  with a strong impact on politics., Under Obama, the Democrats have become even more firmly established in Americans eyes as the party of tolerance and diversity. In a Pew poll taken in February, almost 6 in 10 Americans said the Democrats were \"tolerant and open to all groups of people.\" More than 6 in 10 said the Republicans were not., In the last two decades, the countrys voting-age population has grown far more diverse, and acceptance of difference has become a more important value for Americans, particularly those younger than 50., The change can be seen in the dizzying speed with which attitudes toward same-sex marriage have shifted., An issue that Republicans used a decade ago to divide Democrats now cleaves their own party. GOP lawmakers in Indiana and Arkansas discovered that earlier this spring when votes to protect business owners with religious scruples against same-sex marriage backfired on them., The degree to which Democrats are basing their appeal on that image of open-mindedness could be seen in the videotaped announcement that Clinton used to launch her presidential campaign last Sunday. The video said almost nothing about policy, but its montage of Americans of varied races, ethnicities and sexual orientations conveyed a clear message about diversity., Republicans who doubt the power of that theme do so at their peril, warns GOP pollster Whit Ayres. In the last election, he notes, Obama lost among voters who said they most valued a president who is a \"strong leader\" or \"has a vision for the future.\" But he won overwhelmingly among those who said they wanted a president who \"cares about people like me.\", Women and minorities have consistently rated the Republicans poorly on that dimension of political leadership, and Democrats have profited as a result., Republicans continue to win big majorities among white voters, particularly men, people older than 50, frequent churchgoers and residents of the South. That support has enabled the party to win big victories in congressional elections, where older, white voters still predominate., But in presidential elections, the white percentage of the electorate has shrunk steadily, from 88% when Reagan first won in 1980, down to 72% in 2012., The white percentage has dropped as increasing numbers of Latinos, and more recently Asian Americans, have become voters. That trend will continue for decades as a diverse generation still in its teens reaches voting age and older whites pass from the scene., What to do about that challenge has split Republicans., Some party strategists argue that pushing just a bit harder will allow the GOP to squeeze one more victory out of the Reagan-era coalition. Obama voters, particularly blacks, may not show up as much without Obama on the ticket, they say., Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has been the most outspoken of the current Republican presidential hopefuls in declaring that nominating a combative conservative  one like him  would drive up Republican turnout., On the other side of the divide, analysts like Ayres, who works for Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and Karl Rove, who was President George W. Bushs chief political strategist, warn that the GOP will lose, regardless of its 2016 candidate, if it fails to find a way to reach out to minority voters, especially Latinos., \"Trying to win a presidential election by gaining a larger and larger share of the vote from a smaller and smaller share of the electorate is a losing proposition,\" Ayres wrote in a recent book, \"2016 and Beyond.\", That sort of internal debate is typical of parties that have repeatedly lost presidential elections, Geer said. Often \"the activists argue that the party was not pure enough in its values, and they push for a more extreme candidate who will be true to the partys ideology.\", Eventually they usually get their wish, and it generally ends badly, he added., \"Ask [Barry] Goldwater or [George] McGovern,\" the 1964 Republican nominee and the 1972 Democratic nominee, Geer said.

{"Content": "[[, The race for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, already as jammed as a Tokyo subway car, has just gotten a lot more crowded with the announcement that Donald Trump and his enormous ego have entered the competition., David Horsey / Los Angeles Times, David Horsey / Los Angeles Times, On Tuesday, The Donald descended on an escalator from the higher reaches of Trump Tower in New York City to declare his candidacy in front of an audience that included a gaggle of passing tourists who were drafted into service by Trumps minions in an effort to pack the room. With his famous hyperbole in high gear, Trump described the crowd of hundreds as numbering in the thousands and beyond anybodys expectations., There have been no crowds like this, Trump declared., Well, actually, there have been, including the larger crowd that cheered for Jeb Bush on Monday in Florida as he finally stated the obvious and formally said he is running for president. Crowd counts aside, there were several distinct contrasts between the two men as they made their entries into the race. Bushs 90-year-old mother, former First Lady Barbara Bush, beamed at her son from the sidelines; Trump was flanked by a family that exuded Kardashian-level glamor and excess. Bush, sans jacket and tie, looked like an insurance office manager on casual Friday; Trump, dressed in a red power tie and expensive blue business suit, looked like the billionaire that he loudly proclaims himself. Bush downplayed any sense that he is entitled to the presidency because his father and brother are ex-presidents; Trump made it clear that he believes he is the only genius running while the rest of the nations political leaders are idiots and losers  including anyone named Bush., Mostly winging it, Trump delivered a political speech that fulfilled the hopes of comedians and cartoonists all across this great land. America, he said, is the worlds biggest sucker, but he is the guy to change that because he just sold a $15-million apartment to a Chinese guy. He curiously asserted that the U.S. has never beaten the Japanese at anything, overlooking Japans decade-long economic stagnation and a certain major war back in the 1940s. In the most noted passage of his remarks, he asserted that Mexican immigrants are a horde of criminals, drug dealers and rapists, except for a rare few that he assumes might possibly be good people. Trump said he would build a Great Wall on the southern border and make Mexico pay for it., There was really no sentence in his announcement that did not display his large ego and small grasp of political complexities. It is nearly impossible to imagine Trump winning the nomination, let alone the presidency. Nevertheless, after toying with the idea of running in past elections, this time he seems to be giving it a serious try. His chances of victory may be remote, but he could have a significant impact on the Republican nominating process., If Trump gets into the debates, he will be the guy willing to start a brawl. A mild-mannered, somewhat cerebral candidate like Bush could easily become Trumps favorite target. Just how Bush and other candidates handle confrontations with The Donald will be important. A flub, a gaffe, a sign of weakness can seriously wound a candidacy, and a stage-savvy bully like Trump could provoke the more credible but overly scripted candidates into doing or saying things they will quickly regret., Despite his stratospheric self-regard, Trump is not the best thing to happen to American democracy since 1776, but for outrageous political theater, the man is, undeniably, box office gold.]", "Date": "20150617", "Title": "[Jeb Bush beware: Donald Trump wants to pick a fight]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/topoftheticket/la-na-tt-donald-trump-wants-to-fight-20150617-story.html", "Author": "[David Horsey]"}
{"Content": "[[, The red wave of the midterms means Republicans will have considerably greater leverage dealing with Barack Obamas waning presidency. In national security matters, however, unlike domestic affairs, Congress confronts important constitutional realities and limitations. How successful Republicans will be depends heavily on their appreciating the constraints regarding foreign and defense policy they face being in the legislative rather than the executive branch., In the vast external realm, the Supreme Court has explained, the Framers intended that the president would dominate: The President alone has the power to speak or listen as a representative of the nation. Congress, collectively and individually, has frequently chafed at this reality, but only on rare occasions have congressional majorities differed so substantively as todays Republicans do from Obamas White House., But it is precisely in such circumstances that Senate and House majorities must resist the temptation to squeeze into the chair behind the presidents Oval Office desk. There will come a time, one hopes sooner than later, when a conservative will occupy that chair. That president will certainly want and need to take advantageof what Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist No. 70, called the executives superior decision, activity, secrecy and dispatch, especially in foreign affairs. Accordingly, the next Congress should use its leg-islative powers as they were intended, and not aspire to be a Team B executive branch. Although Obama has not demonstrated Hamiltons prized qualities, neither will nearly 300 Re-publican legislators acting collectively., What, then, should Capitol Hill Republicans focus on internationally?, First, Congress should be the arena in which to highlight the broad national debate we need over Americas place in the world. Through hearings and floor debates on weapons proliferation, terrorism and broad strategic issues, House and Senate Republicans can drive the discussion: Do Americans buy Obamas view that the United States is too dominant, and that our vigorous global presence contributes to tensions and conflict? Or do they endorse Ronald Reagans vision that a strong America creates what minimal order and stability we have, a role critical to maintaining the liberal world economic order so vital to our way of life and domestic standard of living?, Second, Congress must be on guard that Obama, like many lame-duck presidents, will see the exercise of his foreign affairs authority as a way of escaping congressional interference. Senators must use the treaty ratification and confirmation processes to prevent Obama from imposing through international agreements what he could not otherwise obtain legislatively. We see this risk already in issues as diverse as gun control, climate change and the death penalty. We must not give Obama a pass on policy decisions that should be resolved through our constitutional processes, not via international organizations and treaties., Finally, Congress central responsibility lies in its appropriations power. Republicans priority must be reversing six years of Obamas catastrophic reductions in defense spending  well over a trillion dollars while domestic spending was exploding. Representatives and senators must understand and explain that deterrence rests on America operating from a position of strength, and that the best way to avoid conflict is to be so clearly superior that potential opponents reject threatening behavior reflexively. , In 2017, a new president will need all the head start he can get in repairing the damage to the United States international reputation and credibility that Obama has gravely weakened. As Reagan said, Yes, the cost is high, but the price of neglect would be infinitely higher., There will undoubtedly be heated debates about the virtues of competing defense priorities, weapons systems and force levels; too many to address here. And there will be those, including Republicans, who cant tell the difference between dollars spent on soybean subsidies and dollars spent on carrier battle groups. There is waste in defense-related budgets that must be eliminated, with the savings plowed back into sensible military expenditures., Nowhere is the waste more evident than in the cumbersome, archaic, nearly incomprehensible defense-procurement system. Under new, incoming chairmen for both the House and Senate Armed Services committees, wide-ranging investigations and the complete reform of military procurement are a feasible prospect. Former Navy Secretary John Lehman believes the best course is to junk the present system and start from scratch, an entirely sensible reaction to the current systems bureaucratic anarchy. A clean start would improve the performance of both government and private contractors, and it is a project Obama has neither interest in nor competence to undertake., This is a more than ample foreign policy agenda for Congress for the next two years. And the underlying debate it will stimulate is an excellent precursor to the 2016 presidential campaign., John Bolton, former U.S. ambassador to the U.N., is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute., Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion]", "Date": "20141113", "Title": "[A foreign affairs to-do list for the GOP]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-bolton-obama-congress-foreign-policy-20141114-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, The relative comity of the race for the Democratic nomination for president was interrupted last week with an unexpectedly sharp attack video aimed in an unexpected direction., Bernie Sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns, said the narrator of a Web video produced by a \"super PAC\" supporting former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley., That the first direct attack of the Democratic primary would focus on guns  a second-tier issue -- and Sanders  a long-shot candidate  would have been hard to predict in a race dominated by front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton and the partys search for an economic message. But as Sanders, the Vermont senator and a self-described socialist, rises in the polls, hes also emerged as the top target  both for those wanting to supplant him as the liberal alternative to Clinton and those arguing that a liberal alternative isnt necessary., It is clear that Bernie Sanders is the most interesting character in the Democratic nomination play at the moment, said Jamal Simmons, a Democratic strategist., Its also clear how Sanders became the hot target. Fueled by his unpolished appeal and unvarnished attacks on moneyedinterests on Wall Street and in Washington, the Sanders campaign is gaining ground  particularly in all-important New Hampshire, where the Vermont senator is a well-known figure. A CNN/WMUR poll released last week found Sanders within 8 percentage points of Clinton. Although Sanders remains a distant challenger in other early-voting states, his status as the progressives protest to the Clinton candidacy is firming up  and the famously cautious Clinton appears unlikely to rely simply on her front-runner status to keep his challenge at bay., Sanders has begun to take hits on three major themes -- gun control, where his record veers some from Democratic party line, his support among African Americans and Latinos, and his broader viability among voters in the general election., Along with the OMalley backers broadside on guns, a close Clinton ally last week labeled Sanders views extreme. A fellow Democratic senator, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, said on MSNBCthat Bernie is too liberal to gather enough votes in this country to be president. She complained that journalists are giving Bernie a pass, particularly in comparison to Clinton, and called for his record to be more closely inspected., Hes against trade  hes against a whole lot of things that are unrealistic in this day and age, McCaskill insisted., The Clinton campaign has not launched any direct attacks on Sanders and largely has stuck to a message heavy on the sort of economic policies the campaign hopes will appease progressives  voting reforms, tax hikes on the wealthy, raising the minimum wage and expanded public preschool., But where Clinton has veered from that script, she has hit issues that strike a contrast to Sanders. In her response to the shooting two weeks ago at a black church in Charleston, S.C., she called for tougher gun laws and noted her husbands passage of a now-expired ban on assault weapons. Clinton went to a black church near Ferguson, Mo., last week and demanded common-sense gun reforms that keep our communities safe as she said more should be done to increase respect on both sides between communities and law enforcement., Sanders campaign has taken a different approach, emphasizing the racist motivations of the shooting suspect in Charleston over the role of stronger gun regulations., Hes happy to have that discussion, said Jeff Weaver, Sanders campaign manager, of Clintons comments. But at the end of the day, its not clear how gun control would have prevented this particular attack. What would have prevented this attack would have been this young man not having this racist hatred in his heart., On Sunday, Sanders argued he had a strong record supporting tougher gun laws  particularly because he comes from a rural state where many hunters are suspect of new gun regulations., Sanders reputation as soft on guns comes in part from his vote against the 1993 Brady Bill, which created mandatory background checks for gun buyers in many sales. Then a member of the House, Sanders argued that it was a matter that should be left to the states. Sanders also voted for the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, a National Rifle Assn.-backed bill intended to protect gun manufacturers and dealers from being sued for negligence when their products are used to commit crimes. The law is opposed by some gun victims families who have sought to hold gun makers accountable for shooting deaths., But Sanders also has voted in favor of a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And in 2013, in the wake of the Sandy Hook school massacre, he supported the amendment that would have expanded background checks to all gun sales in a commercial setting, closing whats known as the gun show loophole. That measure fell short of passage., Sandersargued in an interview on ABC News This Weekthat his record showed an understanding of how gun issues play in rural America and would make him a better leader on the effort., If we are finally going to have any serious success, what we need to do is bridge this cultural divide between rural America -- and I represent the very rural state -- and urban America and come up with some common-sense legislation which includes everything that Ive just voted for and maybe more, he said. But one thing we cant have, we cant have people demagoguing against folks just because they go out and hunt and they own guns. On the other hand, rural America has got to understand that guns in Vermont are not the same thing as guns in Chicago where theyre used to kill kids or shoot at police officers., Whether guns will emerge as the damaging weakness in Sanders case to progressives is unclear., Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean faced similar questions during his bid for the Democratic nomination in the 2004 election. Dean also opposed some tougher gun laws then, breaking from his party. He says he was asked repeatedly about his positions on the campaign trail, but doesnt remember it playing much of a role in his eventual defeat., Sanders bigger challenge will be showing he can connect with African American and Latino voters, Dean noted. Coming from the overwhelmingly white Vermont, its likely new territory for the senator., Bernies coalition is very broad. It is the Ben and Jerry set, but its also white, working-class voters who feel nobody speak for them, Dean said. The only electorate Bernies not been tried against is the electorate of color., Sanders will have to show that he can persuade those voters that they share his economic populism. Thats his steep learning curve, Dean said., Dean, who backs Clinton, dismissed comparisons between his campaign and Sanders bid. Aside from their shared home state and plain-spoken styles, theres not much there, he said. His campaign was about pushing his party to the left, on the war in Iraq as well as healthcare and economic issues. I was really running against the Democratic Party and Bernie is not -- the Democratic Party has become much more populist., The Sanders campaign says it will step up its effort to make its case to African American and Latino voters. Sanders spoke at a conference of Latino officials in Las Vegas this month. Hes due to address the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in late July, where Sanders will probably note his work in the civil rights movement. Black voters just havent heard his message yet, he said., Given the disparity that were seeing in income and wealth in this country, it applies even more to the African American community and to the Hispanic community. And what we are going to do is make a major outreach effort to those communities, let people know my background, let people know my record, and I think were going to do just fine in those communities., For more politicscoverage, follow @khennessey., ALSO:, Chris Christie blasting both parties, enters 2016 race as a long shot, Next batch of Hillary Clintons emails will be released, Lack of clear front-runner in huge 2016 field highlights fractures within GOP]", "Date": "20150630", "Title": "[Bernie Sanders is hot enough on the campaign trail to be drawing attacks]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-bernie-sanders-gun-control-20150629-story.html", "Author": "[Kathleen Hennessey]"}

He also said he would vote to defund Planned Parenthood if he were in the Senate., Despite a bare-bones booth at the convention, Sundheim, a Silicon Valley lawyer who entered the race earlier this month, said he had the chops to make it to the general election.

{"Content": "[[, The Republican National Committees plans for the 2014 midterm election went far beyond taking control of Congress: They were to put in motion a massive technology push aimed at capturing the White House in 2016., The party vowed to catch up with  even leapfrog over  the Internet wizards who helped orchestrate Barack Obamas victories., The blueprint called for a nationally synchronized technology platform to collect every piece of information obtained about voters by every Republican running for office, whether for city council or the U.S. Senate. The eventual presidential nominee would be endowed with reams of real-time data that could be used to target voters with unprecedented efficiency and precision., But that promised innovation has run into the head winds of contract disputes, suspicions about data firms political loyalties and friction with the tea party. Voter information is being collected out in the field by a jumble of firms not always working in concert. Among them is a Koch brothers-funded outfit that one day could eclipse the national GOPs., As a result, Republicans are heading toward 2016 with that crucial data being collected in systems that dont communicate seamlessly, experts say  and may not by election day., There is a clear sense on the Republican side that they need to catch up, said Eitan Hersh, a Yale University political science professor and expert on political data mining. But there is not a clear sense of how they should be doing it, and who should take the lead., In Washington, RNC officials take exception to any suggestion that the party is lagging behind. They say Republicans are positioned exactly as they should be following an enormous investment in technology talent and infrastructure that helped them bolster their House majority and win control of the Senate in November., But the GOP doesnt have what the Democrats do., Candidates on that side, from the top of the ticket to the bottom, utilize the same computer platform in all 50 states. Every time a volunteer in the field talks to a voter, information is added to a mega-file. The party endorses one product that every state works through, called VoteBuilder., The honest truth is, Democrats are ahead of Republicans because of their fundamental belief in the collective, said Vincent Harris, digital director of last years reelection campaign for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). This is very much a clash of ideologies, playing out through campaign tactics., Inside the Republican Party, it also has been a clash of consultants., A firm run by close associates of Karl Rove  advisor to President George W. Bush and a polarizing figure in the party  oversees the RNC project., But some activists worry the effort is out of touch with the Silicon Valley culture of information sharing, hampering efforts to overtake the Obama machine that so successfully embraced the tech industrys ethos., Rep. Dave Brat, for one, galvanized the grass roots with technology not integrated with the Rove-affiliated products when he unseated powerful and deep-pocketed House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia in last years GOP primary., There has been no arrangement made for the RNC to have access to this data, said Nancy Smith, who advised Brat, a tea party favorite, on software. She said that conservative activists see the national partys inability to unify all its candidates around a single system as a reason Republicans keep slipping in Virginia, a presidential battleground state., There is a real belief that we would do better in Virginia if we had the tools, Smith said., Brat used a company called rVotes; its owner, Steve Adler, helped invent the platform Obama used., You cant just say you are going to do something like this and expect it to happen, Adler said of RNC assurances that its technology effort will be able to outperform the Democratic National Committees VoteBuilder in 2016., Republican officials argue that their mash of technologies can easily be coordinated to collect, store and manipulate a central trove of data as effectively as VoteBuilder can. Most candidates who ran in 2014, they said, fed their data into a voter file that the national GOP says is now the most extensive and current in the country., We believe in free markets and innovation, said Katie Walsh, chief of staff at the RNC. We believe competition makes everything better. I dont believe the party or any company should be saying, This is the product, go use it, thats it., One thing is clear: The Republican Party does not have full control over data collected in the field. A growing chunk of it is under the stewardship of a firm bankrolled by the billionaire conservative activists Charles and David Koch., The company, i360, emerged as Republicans scrambled to rebuild their technology infrastructure. It takes a different approach than startups like rVotes, which help clients collect data and upload it to the RNC or anyone else the client wishes. i360 holds onto much of the data itself., In 2014, the company agreed to deposit that data into the RNCs national voter file. Such an agreement has not been reached for 2016., Its a source of anxiety for the RNC, because i360 is proving to be popular with candidates. As more use its technology, the Koch network gains influence over the voter data Republicans across the country need to mount their campaigns., Some worry that i360 could decide to block Republican candidates who dont hew to the Koch agenda from accessing key voter information., It is very dangerous to put a company that has no accountability to anyone and is not elected to anything in charge of the data people need to run for office, Walsh said., McConnell did not use i360 for his successful reelection effort. Nor did his campaign heed the call to embrace a platform named Beacon, which many were promoting as the answer to VoteBuilder., I am glad we didnt because, if we had, nothing would have been finished, Harris said of Beacon, since mothballed., McConnell instead embraced a hybrid approach that the RNC now encourages candidates to take, tapping into party data but using tools from an independent firm. But Harris said officials in Washington did not seem particularly excited about the pioneering firm McConnell chose, NationBuilder, which also does work for politicians who brand themselves as progressives., There is this concern that if your data is with a bipartisan company, it will slip into the hands of the enemy, Harris said.

{"Content": "[[, The Republican presidential campaign came to California en masse last week for the debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, and when it ended the candidates largely beat it for more productive environs., Many took off for South Carolina, an early voting state and the site of a conservative confab Friday. Donald Trump headed to New Hampshire, the first primary state, where he drew criticism Thursday for failing to correct a supporter who asserted President Obama is a Muslim., Among the presidential candidates, only Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, stuck around for this weekends state Republican convention in Anaheim. Huckabee has been ranked seventh among the candidates, with an average national poll share of under 6%., So the fact that only Huckabee bothered to show up at the convention said everything about Republicans presidential prospects here. As the old song goes: \"Turn out the lights, the partys over.\", While that is true at the presidential level, however, the convention opens at a time of bolstered optimism among Republicans for some recent state victories. From the outside some of them may seem small, but they are important., In hard-fought elections, Republicans have blocked Democrats from holding a supermajority of the Legislature, which would have allowed Democrats to rule at will because the party also controls the governors office., The GOP success mattered when Gov. Jerry Brown recently tried to raise taxes, including some that would have helped finance $3.6 billion in repairs to the states roads. The plan was quashed when Republicans announced their opposition and remained united  a result not always accomplished in past years., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, If that signaled why Republicans have worked hard to eke out wins in as many seats as possible, a presentation at the state party convention showed just how tough accomplishing that will be., The session dissected the unexpected 2014 Assembly victory of Catharine Baker. Consultants key to the victory, including Duane Dichiara from her campaign and James Fisfis from the independent effort that backed her, outlined a road map that, they suggested, might also work for other Republican candidates., Of great help to her was the states relatively new rule that sends the top two finishers, regardless of party, into the general election. In a few districts, like hers, that has altered the electoral strategy in complex ways., The incumbent was termed out, meaning that no one had an unassailable advantage. The other main candidates, besides Republican Baker, were Democrats, chief among them Steve Glazer, a former Brown aide who has run afoul of organized labor, and Tim Sbranti, a teacher and teachers union official., With everyone assuming a Democrat would ultimately prevail in the strongly Democratic Bay Area district, neither the labor interests who backed Sbranti nor the business and education reform forces who backed Glazer would give an inch, warring to the tune of millions of dollars., Bakers allies essentially fed the Democratic civil war by sending mailers critical of Glazer, helping to accomplish their goal of knocking out the candidate they considered their biggest threat in the general election., During the general election campaign, Bakers team  the campaign and her independent backers  then went at Sbranti, accusing him and his labor allies of a \"smear\" of Glazer in the primary. They also excoriated him as a defender of the unions who had gone out on strike against the Bay Area Rapid Transit district. The strike had hit the commuter-heavy district hard and proved to be a dramatic player in the race., \"I dont think we would have won without that, and we had nothing to do with it,\" said Fisfis, the consultant for the independent committee, largely financed by Republican donor Charles Munger Jr., He noted that the lineup of the primary, with multiple Democratic candidates and Baker, forced all of them to seek the support of all types of voters. As a moderate Republican, Baker had an appeal that no conservative Republican would have had. In the end she defied the Democratic registration edge to win by three points., \"All we had to do was sow doubts and give them permission to vote for a Republican,\" said Baker strategist Dichiara., The question for Republicans is how to replicate it. Few expect it would be possible to do so in a statewide race; although there are significant splits among Democrats on such issues as education and state employee pension policy, its hard to imagine that the winner of any party warfare would lose to a Republican., \"You cant have a statewide BART strike,\" as Fisfis said., In distinct districts, however, Republicans might be able to find an issue that allows them to break through the normal partisan frame, particularly if Democrats are fighting themselves., But Republicans also would have to find candidates who reflect not the highly conservative national face of the party but a more moderate California one; they would have to have enough money  or moneyed outside allies  to finance those candidates efforts; and they would have to persuade California voters to cast ballots for the representative of a party that is growing smaller by the year., The odds that Republicans dramatically alter their standing in Californias statewide races seem long. The odds that they win incrementally, in ways that may occasionally produce the outsized results seen in the road tax battle, seem not as long at all., Cathleen.decker@latimes.com, Twitter:@cathleendecker, For more on politics, go to www.latimes.com/decker and www.latimes.com/politics., ALSO, Democratic clash: Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins to challenge Sen.

{"Content": "[[, The Republican presidential candidates will debate at the Ronald Reagan library Wednesday, and you cant help but wonder what the Gipper would think of this bunch., Would that sound you hear at the start of the debate be Reagan rolling over in his nearby grave as each candidate tries to cozy up?, Nobody knows. But as someone who covered him for 20 years in Sacramento and Washington, I can guess., Reagan probably would be enjoying the show  not just this event in Simi Valley, but the overall campaign circus  and be especially curious about the barker, Donald Trump., The former president and governor would also probably be wishing he could run in this scattered field. Its huge size  16  reflects a party leadership vacuum that hed quickly fill, chasing off all but a small handful of wannabes., Get more national political newsand the latest from Campaign 2016 >>, To some degree, he would admire Trumps projection of authenticity and appeal to the disaffected, the voters disgusted with government and politics. That was a Reagan route to election victories., It was Reagan who, after the GOPs post-Watergate drubbing in 1974, urged his party to offer voters \"a cause to believe in  raising a banner of no pale pastels, but bold colors.\", Front-runner Trump flies bold colors while many of the other candidates wrap themselves in pastels., But Reagans secret to success in office  something many in the party have never understood  is that he often governed in pastels, as a pragmatist. He raised taxes or lowered them as he felt was needed. He never hesitated to negotiate with Democrats  or commies., Hes the most environmental governor in California history  protecting wild rivers from dams, preserving a Sierra wilderness by blocking highway builders, creating an air resources board that led to the nations first auto smog controls., As governor, he signed legislation allowing collective bargaining for local government workers. Think about that, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin., What Reagan would not admire about Trump  would be repulsed by are his bombast and insults. Reagan didnt care for blowhards. The Gipper used tough words  \"Tear down this wall\"  but was always dignified and gracious, especially in public. The Donald carries on like he needs anger management., If Reagan got a little personal, he did it with humor, as in gently jabbing his 1980 opponent, President Carter: \"Anyone who says he likes cold showers will lie about other things too.\", \"Reagan would have never called people stupid even if he thought they were,\" George Steffes, his legislative lobbyist in Sacramento, told me., Reagan, unlike Trump, definitely would not be calling any woman a fat pig, dog or slob. And unlike Trump, he would not question whether Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was a war hero. He idolized McCains military service. Nor, unlike Trump, would he characterize Mexicans who migrated here illegally as rapists and drug runners, or vow to deport all 11 million. As president, after all, he signed an amnesty law., Reagan appealed to our better angels, offering inspiration and hope. Trump stirs our bitter juices and rouses our uglier instincts. Perhaps that reflects this cyberspace age of impersonal and caustic verbiage., See the most-read stories this hour >>, But there are other Republicans running, many of them civilly. One problem for them is that Trump has been sucking up most of the media oxygen and theyre gasping for air., I called some old Reagan hands and watchers to ask them how hed be sizing up the candidates., \"Ive always been hesitant to guess what Reagan would do or think,\" said Stu Spencer, chief strategist of his successful campaigns for governor and president. \"Heres a guy who went to Sacramento and signed the most liberal abortion law in America. He was a very tough guy to peg.\", That said, Spencer figured that concerning Trump, \"Reagan would just smile and shake his head.\", Reagan wouldnt be endorsing anyone, Spencer continued. \"Hed say, Let them fight it out.\" Still, the consultant guessed, hed have some favorites, such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Walker., Political strategist Ken Khachigian, who wrote major presidential speeches for Reagan, said \"he would be alternately bemused and in some ways troubled. Hed chuckle at so many running., \"But hed be troubled that weve reached the stage where there are no logical five or six heavyweights who have worked their way up the ranks to run. Hed see this as a party not focused enough to keep some of these people out of the race.\", Khachigian added: \"Hed probably have some joke to deal with it. Hed come up with something like cheaper by the dozen, out of an old movie. Then hed go back and ride his horse.\", Journalist and biographer Lou Cannon, who has written several books about the GOP icon, said \"the Reagan library has become like a cathedral where these guys have to come to pay homage to the Gipper. Its kind of a secular shrine., \"But if you gave most of them a test on what Reagan did, they wouldnt have a clue.\", Cannon said hell go to the debate and \"count how many times they bring up Reagan.

They include senators, former governors and even a reality TV star. And even more candidates expected to enter the wide-open race this summer. Staff writer Kurtis Lee explains.   , Even before Trump jumped into the race, the logic of reality TV has had an effect on all the GOP campaigns., The cast of candidates vying to be president includes some who have joined the race for the same reasons aging sitcom stars put on their dancing shoes and learn to tango. They know they have little chance of winning, but even losing could be good for their careers., The rise of long-shot, nontraditional candidates is a growing trend, particularly in the recent open Republican contests. None will publicly admit it, but as was true four years ago, several candidates appear to be using the presidential race more as a springboard to television or radio punditry or the speaking circuit than as a contest to actually win office., Some need to expand their donor base. Others may walk away with a book deal. All thats required is a healthy ego and a few donors., \"You have a category of people who exist in that fuzzy space where celebrity and politics meet in our culture. Youve seen, increasingly, a number of those candidates running, said Steve Schmidt, a GOP strategist., The trend gives some traditionalists pause and some party operatives heartburn as they try to manage a freewheeling and growing field., The partys front-runners former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker or Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, for example  dont fall into this new group. Some of the second tier Carly Fiorina or Sen.

Michele Bachmann 2016 looks almost staid., But its the sheer number of candidates this year that has created problems for Republican officials. Four years ago, the largest candidate debates had eight participants. This year, the party has struggled to find a way to limit the cast to 10 with the knowledge that some, like Trump, who come with high name recognition, could push aside lesser-known but more substantive hopefuls like Graham., As Mitt Romney did four years ago, this years strait-laced candidates will have to learn to run alongside less predictable counterparts., In his statement Tuesday, for example, Trump said he would build a wall on the countrys border with Mexico., \"And I would have Mexico pay for it,\" he shouted., He also took a strong shot at Bush, who announced his candidacy Monday. Trump jabbed him for his support of Common Core, the national education standards, and for backing immigration reform two issues that already have hurt Bushs standing with conservatives in the party., How the hell can anyone vote for this guy? Trump said., The Republican National Committee emphasizes the upside to the candidate surge. The field is full of quality candidates, spokeswoman Allison Moore said., We have a neurosurgeon, major CEOs, accomplished governors and senators all are highly talented people and capable of defeating Hillary Clinton, Moore said., Whats more, several of the candidates have agreed to share the data they collect from voters for use during the general election. The more candidates out there making contact, the better for the eventual nominee, party strategists say., The reason Republicans seem to have attracted more nontraditional candidates than Democrats may be a function of timing. The rise of social media and digital fundraising has coincided with three consecutive open races for the GOP nomination., More people are running now, frankly, because social media allows you to launch a campaign without the funds in the bank or the organization on the ground, said Lee Edwards, an expert on the conservative movement at the Heritage Foundation, who bemoaned the rise of candidates who seem more concerned about their bank accounts than ideology or party politics., Some of these candidates are banking on exposure through things like the debate. But also, just because they are candidates, this will, frankly, advance their own careers. We know that if so-and-so is a presidential candidate he can charge a higher fee for speaking, for an article or for a book contract., The power of conservative media may also play a role. Conservative radio and Fox News have welcomed some media-savvy also-rans with open arms and big paychecks. The model here is former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, whose failed bid in 2008 made him a household name, at least in Republican parts of the country, and landed him a show on Fox News. (Huckabees show ended in January, when he announced he was exploring another run for president.), Trump fits into a different category, noted Schmidt, one perhaps only he occupies., Politics has always had its showmen, and Donald Trump is a showman, he said, but hes one who taps into a very real sentiment even if he is accused of making a mockery of the process., There are substantial parts of the American population who think its already a joke  that its fundamentally not on the level, said Schmidt, who in the 2012 campaign referred to that seasons GOP candidate debates as \"the best reality show on TV.\", A candidate like that has a potential to tap into that in a pretty powerful way.

So far, wealthy donors there appear to be holding back., California was Americas top source of campaign money for the 2012 election, with Obama raising $62.8 million here for his reelection and his GOP rival, Mitt Romney, $41.3 million.

Bush himself is scheduled to attend a breakfast fundraising reception Thursday in Bakersfield, a longtime center of Republican agriculture and oil money., Private equity investor Bradford M. Freeman, who hosted the Brentwood event at his home and gave $1 million to Bushs Right to Rise USA super PAC, was a major fundraiser for former Presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush., Freeman said hed forsworn fundraising, but when Jeb Bush got in the race, he \"sort of didnt have a choice to get back into the saddle.\", Bush and his super PACs have raised $13.6 million in California this year, more than any candidate other than Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton, who  with her super PACs  has collected $17.3 million., About $7.6 million in donations Bush collected in the state came from the Bay Area. His biggest California donors, at $1.5 million apiece, are both from San Francisco: investment executive William Oberndorf and Helen Schwab, wife of brokerage firm founder Charles Schwab., Bush fundraiser Bill Draper, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, said the reason for the candidates support in the area was simple: \"Hes going to be good for business.\", GOP hopeful Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive, is also heavily reliant on California money. She has pulled in more than $2.7 million from the state  more than half her overall total  with most of the donations coming from Los Angeles County., Charles Munger Jr., a Palo Alto physicist who gave $100,000 to a Fiorina super PAC, said he hoped Republican voters would soon tire of Donald Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who lead in the polls, and see Fiorina as a better alternative to politics as usual., \"They are looking for someone who is not part of the Washington establishment to come in and set things right,\" Munger said., Clinton also received most of her money from Los Angeles County, where contributors slightly favored Democrats. Her biggest donors include Hollywood entertainment tycoons Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Haim Saban, each of whom gave $1 million to her Priorities USA Action super PAC., This analysis only covers donations of $200 or more. A so-called super PAC is a type of political action committee allowed to raise unlimited sums of money in support of a candidate but forbidden from making direct contributions or coordinating with the campaign., After the Bay Area, which accounted for $20.7 million in giving to all presidential candidates this year, Los Angeles County was a close second with $18.7 million., Orange Countys $1.6 million made it a distant third, with most of that money going to Republicans., NEWSLETTER:Get the days top headlines from Times Editor Davan Maharaj >>, Fred Smoller, a political science professor at Chapman University in Orange, said wealthy donors in Orange County appeared to be waiting to see if an establishment candidate, such as Bush, can pull ahead of Trump in opinion polls., \"I cant imagine too many people here from the wealthiest groups supporting Donald Trump, primarily because he wants to raise taxes on the wealthy,\" Smoller said., Mark Chapin Johnson of Ladera Ranch, a top California fundraiser for Mitt Romney and George W.

{"Content": "[[, The so-called sharing economy is fast emerging as a 2016 presidential battleground, exposing fundamentally different approaches over how to embrace new technologies without hurting American workers., Eager to court millennial voters and deep-pocketed tech executives, Republicans have almost universally praised smartphone apps that allow consumers to hire drivers, rent apartments and buy or sell just about any service online, latching onto them as prime examples of free-market entrepreneurship and workplace deregulation., But in what is shaping up to be the first Uber election, Democrats have been more cautious, struggling to avoid appearing resistant to the popular new ventures while highlighting their potential negative effect on workers pay and benefits., Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton sparked the Uber debate last week by pointing to the risks such new business models posed for workers., \"This on demand or so-called gig economy is creating exciting opportunities and unleashing innovation,\" Clinton said, \"but its also raising hard questions about workplace protections and what a good job will look like in the future.\", Top Republican opponents pounced on her skepticism, portraying her as out of touch. Within days, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush made a public show of ordering up an Uber car to deliver him to a tech firm in San Francisco., Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), whose 2015 book \"American Dreams\" included a chapter called \"Making America Safe for Uber,\" focused on the generational divide, saying Clinton was \"trapped in the past, and cannot understand how the world is changing.\", Rand Paul, the libertarian-leaning Republican senator from Kentucky, wrote dismissively on Twitter that voters shouldnt listen to a candidate whos been driven in a limousine for the last 30 years., Clinton risks alienating Americans who are increasingly enamored of the convenience and efficiency of the \"gig\" economy, or aligning herself too closely with labor-backed liberals, such as New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is fighting Ubers push into his city., \"Progressive politicians are making a major error by positioning against the sharing economy,\" Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior advisor to President Obama, said in a tweet. \"We need to be shaping the future, not opposing it.\", Veteran Republican digital strategist Mindy Finn called Clintons comments a \"huge misstep\" that could backfire. \"When I see Hillary Clinton kind of pushing back on the sharing economy  theres nothing about that that I think will be appealing to younger voters.\", But the risks dont flow only one way. With some economists predicting the sharing economy could be as disruptive as the Industrial Revolution, Republicans also may suffer with voters if they present too rosy or simplistic a view., Just as the 19th century backlash against industrialization and worker exploitation led to many of the labor rights and safety protections enjoyed today, a similar movement is building in support of \"gig\" workers forced to scrape together a hodgepodge of jobs that barely pay the bills and lack security, pensions and other workplace benefits., \"This happened during the Gilded Age,\" said labor historian Nelson Lichtenstein, a professor at UC Santa Barbara, comparing the vast wealth of the startups  5-year-old Uber is now estimated to be valued at a stunning $50 billion  to that of the 19th century industrialists. \"That creates the inequality we talk about.\", Its a conversation playing out not only on the campaign trail but in legal battles against the companies in states across the country, including California. At issue is how to reap the economic benefits of the new technologies without losing the hard-fought protections and benefits for U.S. workers. Some policy experts envision a new category of workers, falling between independent contractors and traditional full-time employees., Clintons team downplayed the partisan debate and emphasized that she had \"no beef\" with Uber or other aspects of the sharing economy. At the same time, Clinton anticipates engaging in a broader policy discussion about the changing workplace environment., \"What shes trying to do is start a very serious conversation about this important and growing part of our economy that is adding innovation and opportunity and excitement, frankly, but is also raising challenges and questions,\" Jake Sullivan, a top Clinton policy advisor, told a group of journalists last week., David Plouffe, Obamas former top campaign strategist who now works as a chief advisor to Uber, said the reaction to Clintons July 13 speech was \"overblown,\" noting that she also said \"very positive things\" about the sharing economy. \"My suspicion over time is you will see her embrace what this means,\" Plouffe said Monday on \"CBS This Morning.\", The bigger peril for Clinton, according to her partys progressive wing, would be to retreat from Republican critics and fail to tackle the looming workplace issues raised in the new economy., \"Its a phenomenal opportunity for Democrats to make clear they stand on the side of working people, even when they support innovation,\" said Neil Sroka, communications director for Democracy for America, the organization founded by former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean., At the same time, Republican candidates may find their Uber-loving stances get them only so far. Their positions on other issues  including immigration reform and net neutrality  are at odds with much of the tech-savvy and millennial audience theyre trying to attract. When Bush spoke last week in San Francisco, for example, some in the audience were more interested in his opposition to gay marriage., \"It looks so phony,\" said one tech industry professional in Washington who was granted anonymity to frankly discuss the campaign. \"If theyre trying to cater to Silicon Valley and people like me, we see right through this.... Its a dangerous place to put yourself out there as the new economy guy.\", While Uber and other startups have been careful to build bipartisan support for their budding industries and some leaders skew toward libertarianism, leading Silicon Valley-based executives have also made no secret of their reliance on Democratic mainstays. Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick, for example, recently praised Obamacare, saying that allowing people to obtain health insurance benefits outside of their job made it possible for people to adopt \"more flexible ways to make a living.\", Uber is also well aware that the current debate is only the beginning of a long discussion about labor policy that will extend beyond the campaign trail., \"Layered on top of all of this is the important question: Whats at stake here?\" said Benjamin Sachs, a professor of labor and industry at Harvard Law School. \"Are the forms of protection and social welfare that weve provided since 1935  are people going to just lose all of that because we have technological change? ... How do we make sure that workers share in the sharing economy?\", lisa.mascaro@latimes.com, Times staff writers Seema Mehta in San Francisco and Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, The sudden death of a candidate lagging in the polls and his replacement by a surging environmentalist has transformed Brazils presidential race and threatens President Dilma Rousseffs hope for a second term., Since a plane crash last month took the life of Eduardo Campos, his successor on the Socialist Party ticket, Marina Silva, has captured support from a diverse mix of voters. Some respond to her call to reject two-party politics as usual and to move environmental concerns to the fore. More conservative voters identify with her evangelical Christian faith or just want to eject the ruling Workers Party after 12 years in power., Whereas Campos was running third in polls, the latest surveys indicate that in the Oct. 5 election, Silva would take Rousseff to a second round and defeat her in the runoff that would come three weeks later., The candidates from the traditional parties will spend the next few weeks attacking Silva and her sometimes murky policies and plans. On Monday, during her first debate as the perceived front-runner, it was clear that the serene, soft-spoken senator and former environmental minister had moved into the cross hairs of Rousseff and Aecio Neves, the candidate for the center-right Social Democracy Party of Brazil, or PSDB., Silva fired back., \"You had promised that Brazil would keep growing. What went wrong?\" she asked Rousseff, referring to an economy that has slowed markedly since the president took over from Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in 2011 and that is expected to perform poorly this year because of the costs associated with the recent World Cup soccer tournament., Though relatively well-known in Brazilian politics, Silva until recently appeared unlikely to participate in this years presidential election. The Socialist Party is the fourth she has been associated with in six years, and her involvement came at the last minute, after she was unable to found a party promoting sustainability., Her agreement to be Campos running mate was widely seen as a marriage of convenience that she would quickly abandon if he lost. Now, as the Socialists presidential candidate, she has gained support, though it also puts her at the head of a diverse and sometimes unlikely coalition., In Brazils complex political landscape, Silvas government might be more progressive than the center-left Workers Party, or PT, on some issues, such as the environment, and more conservative on others, such as social issues and gay rights, analysts say. She probably would be more market-friendly than Rousseff., \"Marina Silva has entered the race attacking the political system itself, even if she has often been part of it, and that has led to a quick upward trajectory for her in the polls,\" said Francisco Fonseca, a political scientist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation university in Sao Paulo. \"This kind of anti-political discourse has worked well here recently, especially with the young, who are unhappy with politics in general, and she is a natural fit for those who want to reject the PT or PSDB., \"But her candidacy may be vulnerable in that it is marked by contradiction,\" he said. \"Shes progressive on the environment but also socially conservative. And her own party is not the one she would have chosen and has programs very different than those she defended independently.\", After the highly popular Lula took office more just over a decade ago, Brazil powered forward economically, 40 million people rose from poverty and the country won the right to host the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics., Rousseff easily won the 2010 election as Lulas hand-picked successor and enjoyed high approval ratings during her first year in office. But the economy slowed, and her popularity dropped after more than 1 million Brazilians took to the streets last year to protest inadequate public services and eventually the high cost of preparations for the World Cup., The soccer tournament, held in June and July, went more smoothly than expected. However, much of the economy shut down to accommodate the event, which will take its toll on GDP growth this year., Silva, in opposing two established parties, is seen as the candidate best placed to channel the energy that led some protesters into the streets last year, analysts say. Even if she does not win, they say, her recent surge has already transformed the landscape of politics in Latin Americas largest country., \"This is now the first election in the last 20 years that will be able to break the division of the country between the Workers Party and PSDB,\" said Joao Augusto de Castro Neves, a political analyst at Eurasia Group in Washington. \"Compared to them, Marina is more of a wild card, for better or worse.\", Supporters of Rousseff say that despite the claims that Silva is a progressive outsider, she has recently made questionable alliances with profitable banks, would have to form a governing coalition with the very parties she criticizes and may be beholden to the conservative views of the powerful evangelical churches that support her., In what was widely seen as the first slip-up of Silvas campaign, her platform was quickly revised to soften its support for gay marriage after the position was attacked by an evangelical pastor on Twitter., \"Her support for marriage equality didnt last more than four tweets,\" quipped Luciana Genro of the left-wing Socialism and Freedom Party during Mondays debate. Silvas camp said the platform revision stemmed from a publishing error., Silva served as a minister under Lula while a member of the Workers Party until 2008. She came in third as Green Party candidate for president in 2010., Silvas inspiring personal story of rising from poverty could help her take on the political establishment in what is still one of the worlds most economically unequal countries. If she wins, goes a quote from journalist and friend Altino Machado, she would be \"the first green president in history, Brazils first black president, and Brazils first president from the Amazon.\", Bevins is a special correspondent.]", "Date": "20140905", "Title": "[Rise of candidate Marina Silva transforms Brazil's presidential race]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/world/brazil/la-fg-ff-brazil-election-20140905-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, The Summer of Sanders  as in Bernie, the Vermont socialist and long-shot presidential hopeful  has featured big crowds flocking to hear the U.S. senators fist-shaking message: 8,000 in Dallas, 10,000 in Madison, 11,000 in Phoenix., The impressive swarm recalls the hordes attracted by another underdog, then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008, and, before that, Howard Dean, a Vermonter who climbed from nowhere to emerge, for a time, as the Democratic front-runner in 2004., It is, in many ways, familiar. In 1980, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts rose from the left to torment the party establishment favorite, a role Californias Alan Cranston played in the 1984 race. Theres always restiveness on the left, said Joe Trippi, who managed Deans presidential campaign. Always., The challenge  one that outmatched all those insurgents, save Obama  is turning curiosity into support, and turning that support into something more than a protest movement, or a way for the discontented to let off steam. Politically, its the difference between long-term commitment and a summer fling., No two campaigns are alike. And if anyone has proved vulnerable to an upstart challenge, its Hillary Rodham Clinton, who seemed every bit as formidable a front-runner in 2007 as she appears today., But even Sanders senior campaign advisor concedes it will be hard to deny Clinton the Democratic nomination this time. Shes a great candidate, said Tad Devine. Shes going to have a broad base of support., But difficult is not impossible. Well have to convince voters [Sanders] program will make a much bigger difference in their lives than whats she talking about, Devine said, and proposals like free college tuition and a $1-trillion infrastructure program offer a lot to work with., Sanders, who plans a rally this Monday night at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, is no fringe candidate. His message condemning corporate power and Wall Street malfeasance, and decrying income inequality and lamenting the squeeze on the middle class, resonates with many in these still-anxious economic times., He benefits too from the explosion of social media. The Internet has opened the spigot to millions in donations and allowed anyone with an onlineconnection to hear the Vermont senators message first-hand. Unlike the olden days, way back in the 20th century, money and attention are no longer so hard to come by., The fact Sanders has been hammering populist themes his whole career  while modeling the fashion sense of an unmade bed  lends an authenticity that Clinton, with her reputation for political shiftiness, cannot hope to match., While she is staying as close to the center as she can and still be a Democrat, Bernie is pushing those topics that Democrats have represented for decades, said Ryan Ellsworth, 38, a Des Moines architect who plans to support Sanders when Iowa casts the first votes of 2016. He is speaking to things that people are passionate about and not calculating what people want to hear., Sanders platform is unreservedly liberal: higher taxes on the wealthy, government-run universal healthcare, a breakup of the nations big financial institutions., Pitching a $15 federal minimum wage, he calls the struggle of the working poor a national disgrace. Clinton, characteristically, is more measured. She, too, backs a higher minimum wage, but not $15 for workers everywhere. What you can do in L.A. or in New York may not work in other places, she says., There are many on the left  anywhere from a quarter to a third of those surveyed  who would like to see a Democrat other than Clinton elected president, or, at the least, make a serious run at the nomination., Partly thats human nature., People like a contest, said Anita Dunn, who helped former New JerseySen. Bill Bradley wage an uphill 2000 Democratic primary fight against Vice President Al Gore, the eventual nominee. These are elections, not coronations., Some, like Nadia Kayyali, a San Francisco privacy rights attorney and Sanders supporter, say they would rathersit out 2016 than back the former first lady., The only functional difference between Hillary and a Republican is reproductive rights, said Kayyali, 33, one of several thousand who attended the recent Netroots Nation progressive gathering in Phoenix., But there are many others like Chris Mills, 29, a political independent who helped create the Warren/Sanders 2016 Facebook page in the vain hope Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren would challenge Clinton from the left., Mills, an information technology worker in Grand Rapids, Mich., is pleased that Sanders, at least, is running. Clinton has a respectable history and an impressive record, he said, but is too beholden to corporations., That said, Mills could end up voting for Clinton in November 2016 if she moves Sanders way and adopts a more labor-friendly agenda., He is not alone. A June Wall Street Journal/NBC poll gave Clinton a 75%-15% lead over the independent senator, consistent with other polls. More importantly, 92% of those asked said they could eventually support Clinton, which suggests many on the left ultimately would rally behind the Democratic nominee, whoever it is., Clinton enjoys other advantages. She is no stranger to the black and Latino communities, two pillars of Democratic support and major voting blocs once the nominating fight moves past the largely white confines of Iowa and New Hampshire., Sanders, an independent most of his political life, is competing against a Democratic stalwart who has built relationships in the party going back more than 40 years. Thats not easy to overcome., Moreover, his policy prescriptions have gone largely unchallenged, which could change overnight if Sanders becomes a real threat to Clinton., Now is the high season for political activists, a time the purists and true believers engage while more casual voters focus on vacation, baseball and the like. That helps someone like Sanders who offers the boldest, most undiluted vision of where Democrats, and the country, ought to go., The true test will come when summer sets, to see if those big crowds keep turning out, or grow even bigger., mark.barabak@latimes.com, Follow  @markzbarabak fornational & California politics., Aug. 5, 9:21 p.m.: Updated with Sanders plan to hold a rally at the Sports Arena in Los Angeles.The first version of this articleposted July 28 at 3:00 a.m.]", "Date": "20150805", "Title": "[Bernie Sanders is drawing big crowds -- but how long will they stick around?]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-sanders-democrats-analysis-20150729-story.html", "Author": "[Mark Z.

{"Content": "[[, The Supreme Court led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. hasnt been friendly to legislative attempts to reduce the corrupting influence of money in election campaigns. But on Wednesday the court finally found a campaign finance regulation it could support. With Roberts joining four liberal justices, the court upheld a Florida ethics rule prohibiting judicial candidates from personally seeking campaign contributions. It was the right decision., The prohibition at issue is admittedly a modest one: Although judicial candidates in Florida may not personally ask for contributions, their surrogates can, and the candidates are allowed to write thank-you notes to contributors. But the courts holding could lay the groundwork for additional restrictions on the role of money in judicial races. That is important because such races, especially for state supreme courts, increasingly have attracted special-interest money. As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in a concurring opinion, \"issue-oriented organizations and political action committees have spent millions of dollars opposing the reelection of judges whose decisions do not [toe] a party line or are alleged to be out of step with public opinion.\", The linchpin of the decision was the difference between elections for judicial office and those for political offices. \"Judges are not politicians, even when they come to the bench by way of the ballot,\" Roberts wrote in the majority opinion. \"And a states decision to elect its judiciary does not compel it to treat judicial candidates like campaigners for political office. A state may assure its people that judges will apply the law without fear or favor  and without having personally asked anyone for money.\", The court was right to distinguish between judicial and other candidates. After all, candidates for political office are expected to make campaign promises. Thats how democracy works. But the only promise judges should make is to interpret the law evenhandedly and to the best of their ability., Yet, even allowing for that distinction, special-interest money can corrode public confidence in government whether it is expended to support the election of a judge or that of a legislator. Welcome as this decision is, it doesnt undo recent rulings that struck down reasonable controls on money in politics designed to minimize not only the reality of corruption but also its appearance. Last year, for example, the court  with Roberts writing the lead opinion  struck down overall limits on how much an individual could contribute to candidates for federal office., The public needs to have confidence in the integrity of all of its elected officials, not just judges. That will be impossible if the court continues its pattern of dismantling reasonable campaign finance laws in the name of the 1st Amendment., Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion and Facebook]", "Date": "20150430", "Title": "[A wise ruling on judicial elections and campaign finance ]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-judges-seeking-campaign-contributions-supreme-court-20150430-story.html", "Author": "[The Times Editorial Board]"}
{"Content": "[[, The Supreme Court term that ended this week will be remembered for the landmark ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, but it will also go down as a year when a fractured conservative bloc resulted in a surprising number of liberal wins., That doesnt mean the court has shifted left, as some have suggested. Instead, perhaps the biggest dynamic driving this term was overreaching by the courts most conservative justices., Under the courts rules, the votes of four justices are needed to add a case to the docket, but a decision requires a majority of at least five., On one case after another, four conservatives are believed to have teed up cases that had the potential to move the law to the right, only to fall short when the time came to vote., Although liberals won, their victories, except for the marriage case, largely kept the status quo in place., \"The lineup of cases this term explains the results, and not a shift in anyones general legal philosophy,\" said Irving Gornstein, who directs the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown Universitys law school., Last week saw three examples. In close votes, the high court rejected conservative-driven lawsuits that sought to scale back President Obamas healthcare law, limit the scope of a housing anti-discrimination law and reverse voter initiatives in California and Arizona that created independent commissions to draw election districts., As usual, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, a Californian, was instrumental. He joined his four liberal colleagues to uphold the Arizona and California commissions aimed at ending gerrymandering and wrote the 5-4 opinion to preserve the broad reach of the federal Fair Housing Act., In the healthcare case, it was Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. who spoke for a 6-3 majority, including Kennedy, holding it was \"implausible\" to read the 900-page Affordable Care Act as barring insurance subsidies in most of the nation, as conservatives claimed it had., The term ended with Justice Antonin Scalia  and many right-leaning pundits  sputtering in anger, accusing Roberts and Kennedy of having betrayed the conservative cause., But court scholars on the right and left cautioned against reading too much into the recent outcomes., \"Sure, the liberals are a bit happier about this term than the conservatives, but its really about two big cases: healthcare and marriage,\" said Ilya Shapiro, a lawyer for the libertarian Cato Institute. On the current court, \"the liberals vote in lockstep. So if the conservatives are aggressive [in accepting far-reaching cases] and they dont get a fifth vote, the liberals win.\", In high-profile or sensitive cases, both conservatives and liberals on the court usually vote to hear a case only when they are confident they have the support needed to win. So why are the conservatives more aggressive in granting new cases?, One explanation is they expected to win with Kennedys vote but misjudged. Others have speculated that the conservative justices fear Democrats will win the White House in 2016 and move the court to the left., By this logic, the next two years might be the last chance to make progress on conservative priorities, even if it means risking a loss., More often than not this term, the gamble did not pay off. Though Republican-appointed justices hold a narrow 5-4 majority over Democratic-appointed ones, liberals prevailed more often in the 5-4 decisions this term, winning 12 out of 19 of such cases, according to figures by Supreme Court watcher ScotusBlog., Even so, conservatives scored several big wins this year, including the most important environmental case., They voted last fall to hear an appeal brought by the coal industry and a coalition of Republican-led states that opposed the Obama administrations plan to strictly limit toxic air pollution from power plants. The Clean Air Act looked to be on the governments side, because it said the Environmental Protection Agency should act to protect the publics health when it was \"appropriate and necessary.\", But in a 5-4 ruling, Scalia and the court said the EPA failed to weigh the high cost of its regulations., Although the courts rulings sometimes gain wide attention, the process of setting the legal agenda is often obscured., Before the 1980s, groups such as the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the American Civil Liberties Union and womens rights advocates routinely appealed cases to the Supreme Court, seeking rulings that would move the law in a liberal direction., But in recent decades, those groups  fearing an appeal would backfire by giving the courts conservatives a chance to rein in liberal programs  have tried to steer clear of the high court whenever possible., In their place, an array of small conservative groups is helping to set the agenda. For example, in 2008, several conservative activists sought to sell and broadcast a video mocking then-Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton as she ran for president., When they ran afoul of the federal election laws, the advocacy group Citizens United appealed the matter to the Supreme Court. Two years later, they won a 5-4 ruling that struck down laws that limit campaign spending by corporations and unions and by wealthy donors who banded together in \"super PACs.\", This fall, the court has agreed to hear more appeals brought by conservative groups, including a lawsuit against the affirmative action policy at the University of Texas and a challenge to a Texas voting law that counts the full population, not just the U.S. citizens, when determining how legislative districts are drawn., Both suits were brought by conservative advocate Edward Blum., Two years ago, the Center for Individual Rights, a small conservative group in Washington, spotted an opinion by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. that questioned the constitutionality of the union fees paid by public school teachers. It decided to launch a challenge to the policies., This fall, its lawyers will argue on behalf of Rebecca Friedrichs, an Orange County teacher who is not a union member and objects to paying \"fair share\" union fees to the California Teachers Assn., With cases slated for the next term on affirmative action, voting districts and union fees, the stage is set for a replay of this terms dynamic. The court is also likely to rule on strict abortion regulations from Texas., If conservatives are more successful in keeping their bloc together, complaints about this years \"liberal\" lurch could quickly fade., \"After next terms expected rulings on affirmative action, abortion, teachers unions and immigration, the liberals may be calling the Roberts court the most conservative in a generation,\" UCLA law professor Adam Winkler said., david.savage@latimes.com, Twitter:@DavidGSavage]", "Date": "20150702", "Title": "[Conservative overreach may explain liberal victories in Supreme Court]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-scotus-wrapup-20150702-story.html", "Author": "[David G.

{"Content": "[[, The surprise retirement of Sen. Harry Reid, the gritty top Democrat in Congress, risks unraveling perhaps the biggest accomplishment of his combative decade in leadership: keeping unruly Democrats united in support of President Obamas agenda and rebuffing an overtly divided GOP., As recently as a few weeks ago, the former amateur boxer gave every indication he would seek reelection in 2016, despite a New Years exercise mishap that left him nearly blinded in one eye., On Friday, the Capitol Hill veteran called it quits, suggesting he preferred to leave a legacy while still in his prime rather than overstay his effectiveness., Somebody should go when theyre still pretty good, Reid said in an interview Friday morning at his home near the Georgetown neighborhood., The 75-year-old Nevadan made it clear that he was leaving on his own terms  not because of his accident, Senate Democrats new minority status or worries about his upcoming reelection campaign., I want to be remembered for when I was able to bat third or cleanup a lot of the time, he said, sitting on a comfortable couch dressed in khakis, a gray cardigan and uncharacteristically colorful striped socks  his special sunglasses still protecting his injured eye., For Democrats, the challenge ahead is whether the post-Reid party can tamp down the growing ideological differences between liberal and more centrist Democrats, navigate a rare transfer of party leadership, and avoid the kind of infighting that has all but paralyzed their Republican colleagues., The timing is particularly sensitive as Democrats look toward the 2016 election, when they have a chance to regain the Senate majority after the Republican takeover this year., There hasnt been an active campaign for the top Democratic leadership position in either the House or Senate since Reid won his current post in 2005. Eager to avoid a leadership fight, Reid promptly anointed the No. 3 Democrat, Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York, as his successor., Schumer, in 22 months  if he plays his cards right  should be able to do it, Reid said. I said, If you need my help, you got it. If Im going to be in your way, Ill get out of your way., Admired for his Wall Street fundraising skills and political savvy, Schumer has made no secret of his desire for the job. But the New Yorkers bold personality is more polarizing among Democrats than Reids., The long-running joke in Washington is that the most dangerous place to be is between Schumer and a television camera  leaving some wary of elevating a leader who could be seen as an East Coast version of another divisive Democrat, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco., On the other hand, Schumer could be a natural bridge for Democrats if Hillary Rodham Clinton were to occupy the White House after 2016. She and Schumer served together for eight years when Clinton was the junior New York senator., Reids choice jumps over the partys current No. 2, Assistant Minority Leader Sen. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois. But an aide to Durbin said he threw his support to Schumer., Reids endorsement is important, but may not resolve the matter. Activists immediately began drafting liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) for the post. Though her ascent seems to be a long shot, her influence will continue to register in the party., Reid told Obama of his decision during a long conversation late Thursday. He said the men recounted their political battles together and reflected on what still needed to be accomplished before both leave office after next years election., There are things we need to do, Reid said, pointing to the military campaign against Islamic State militants, climate change and other issues., Obama has leaned heavily on Reid to implement his policies, most notably with the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Even when Reid at times disagreed on strategy or tactics, he frequently served as a buffer for the president, protecting him from Republican attempts to undercut the administrations policies., Harry has become not only an ally, but a friend, Obama said Friday in a statement. Im proud of all we have accomplished together, and I know the Senate will not be the same without him., With Reid now positioned as a lame duck for the next two years, Obama may be losing a trusted ally if the minority leaders political influence begins to wane., At the same time, Reids decision to bow out in 2016 could leave other senators feeling less inclined to stick to a unified party position. For Obama, that could help advance some of his priorities, such as providing the few Democratic votes he needs to pass the 12-nation Asian trade pact. The accord is opposed by most Democratic lawmakers but supported by most Republicans., Republicans are certain to try to capitalize on the moment of potential Democratic disarray., Hit the road, Harry, cheered a fundraising appeal from Tea Party Express, a political action committee., Conservative groups had made Reid their No. 1 target last time he ran, in 2010, and intended to do so again. News of his retirement brings us great pleasure, the PAC said., Reids retirement provides Republicans with what is likely to be their best opportunity to pick up an additional Senate seat in 2016. A race that was considered close but leaning in Reids direction suddenly has become a toss-up and will be among the most closely watched and probably hardest-fought in the country., Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval is the overwhelming favorite of the Republican establishment to succeed Reid, though he seems to have all but taken himself out of the race. Reid has endorsed Catherine Cortez Masto, a former state attorney general now serving as executive vice chancellor of the Nevada System of Higher Education., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said that Reid was underestimated often, noting that his distinctive grit and determined focus  continue to make him a formidable opponent today., Even some Democrats have bristled at Reids tight-fisted style as Senate majority leader from 2007 to 2015, including his refusal to allow amendment votes. Reid had been increasingly blamed for Senate gridlock and dysfunction, which some Democrats said may have contributed to the partys losses in the November election., In Washington, Reid may be most remembered for changing Senate filibuster rules to allow approval of Obamas nominees., In the end, a man who pulled himself up from the forlorn little mining town of Searchlight, Nev., said he felt he had done all he could do., The senator had made a preliminary decision over the Christmas holiday that he was ready to retire, an aide said, but then the accident brought out his fighting instinct. He wanted to regain his footing before moving forward with such a momentous decision., Even with its many gray-haired statesmen, the Senate can be unkind to lawmakers who cling to office. Reid would be in his mid-80s by the time another term came to a close, and the senator, who grew up listening to radio broadcasts of baseball games and always imagined himself playing the outfield, said he didnt want to finish his career as a designated hitter., In Nevada, Reid has left his imprint  not just on the few buildings bearing his name, but on policies to develop renewable energy resources that have sometimes caused controversy. Some credit  or blame  him for single-handedly stopping the nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain outside Las Vegas., The senator said that he had no interest in becoming a lobbyist or a high-powered lawyer, but that he might write another book., The one thing thats not on my to-do list is: Im not going to spend more time with my kids, said Reid, who is known for his crusty way of saying what others may think but not express., He said he and his wife, Landra, talk to their children every day and have a pet peeve about citing that reason for retirement. We just think thats obnoxious., lisa.mascaro@latimes.com, michael.memoli@latimes.com, mark.barabak@latimes.com, , 6:57 p.m.:This report has been revised throughout for additional details, updates and clarity., 11:53 a.m.: This article was updated with comments from a Los Angeles Times interview with Harry Reid., 9:20 a.m.: This article has been updated with Harry Reids comments about informing President Obama of his retirement plans., 9:04 a.m.: This article has been updated with Harry Reids endorsement of Sen.

{"Content": "[[, The theatrical drama of the first Republican debate Thursday focused on the man at center stage in Cleveland, Donald Trump, and the bombastic rhetoric he has used to propel himself to the front of the GOP field., But when the Republicans return to the same arena next summer for their convention, it is extremely unlikely that Trump will be the partys nominee, given that a wide swath of the party, particularly its elected officials, finds him unacceptable., So even as the Fox News moderators grappled with the billionaire real estate developer over his history of bankruptcies, past support for Democratic politicians and sometimes offensive statements, a separate and probably more consequential debate was taking place among the other candidates about which of two competing paths the party should follow to win the 2016 election., Four years ago, the 20 debates that the Republican candidates participated in consistently drove the party to the right. GOP leaders, looking back after the election, decided that the debates had harmed their eventual nominee, Mitt Romney, and vowed to avoid that this time., But in Thursdays debate, the partys continued division over which direction to take remained very much on display., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, One side looks at the partys dismal record in presidential elections  losing the popular vote in five of the last six  and the demographic tides and argues that Republicans need to reach out in order to appeal to a changing nation., The other side looks at the partys streak of victories in congressional and state elections, capped by a near-sweep of contested races in 2014, and says the key to victory is to reach in, to find ways to awaken what they see as a conservative majority just waiting for the right candidate to stir it to life., The tension between those two views ran through the debate., The three candidates from the countrys two most populous swing states, former Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio from Florida and Gov. John Kasich from Ohio, all base their campaigns on the outreach theory. So, too, does Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, though he emphasizes a different set of issues than the other three., On the other side stand Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, along with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee., Cruz and Walker both won their current jobs by organizing and motivating conservative voters, and both say they can repeat that strategy in a general election. Huckabee has based his campaign almost entirely on his appeal to evangelical voters., The difference between the two camps could be seen on one issue after another., On immigration, for example, Bush criticized those who \"talk about this as a wedge issue\" and defended his support for \"earned legal status\" for those in the country illegally., Walker, who has admitted changing his mind on the issue, emphasized the conservative slogan of \"no amnesty,\" insisting on the \"need to secure the border\" before any other reforms can be considered., Cruz turned the question into an opportunity to denounce Congress GOP leadership, with whom he has conducted an extended feud., \"We keep winning elections,\" Cruz said, but \"we dont have leaders who honor their commitments\" to a conservative agenda., Kasich, asked about same-sex marriage, noted that he had recently attended the wedding of a gay friend and added, \"We need to give everybody a chance  treat everybody with respect.\" The Supreme Court has ruled on the issue, he said, and \"well accept it.\", Huckabee, when asked about abortion, denounced the high court. \"The Supreme Court is not the Supreme Being,\" he said., Democrats have their divisions too, of course, with the partys left-wing activists pushing for greater efforts to redistribute income, tougher limits on big banks and stronger environmental regulations. But the splits among Republicans run deeper., About 1 in 3 people who identify themselves as Republicans do not have a favorable opinion of their party, a recent Pew Research Center survey found. By contrast, Democrats are far more unified, with just over 1 in 10 failing to have a positive opinion of their party., The divisions within the GOP repeatedly have hamstrung the partys congressional majority, undermining Speaker John A. Boehners authority in the House and challenging Majority Leaders Mitch McConnells power in the Senate. The split could become even more dramatic this fall as a fight over federal money for Planned Parenthood threatens to lead to a government shutdown., Many conservative strategists see that threatened fight as an opportunity  a way to rally core supporters by combining opposition to abortion with the GOPs message of limited government and restricting federal spending., In Thursdays debate, several candidates allied themselves with that sentiment, noting that they had cut off funds for Planned Parenthood in their states or favored doing so., But Republican establishment figures, including McConnell of Kentucky, see the conservative plan as an intolerable risk. They fear that the public, which polls show already sees the GOP as the more extreme party, will blame Republicans for any government shutdown., \"One of my favorite old Kentucky sayings is, Theres no education in the second kick of a mule. Weve been down this path before,\" McConnell said at a news conference hours before the debate. He was referring to previous shutdowns going back to the Clinton administration., How that tension within the party will be resolved will not be clear for at least six months, but Thursdays debate began the process. Until now, the GOP field has steadily grown. From here on, the winnowing begins., david.lauter@latimes.com, ALSO:, As GOP candidates debate, Clinton aides cheer Trump show, First GOP debate: Donald Trump gets the most attention, plus 10 key moments, Republican presidential debate: 17 compete for attention, with Trump at the center]", "Date": "20150807", "Title": "[Republican Party divisions nearly upstage Donald Trump in first 2016 debate]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-gop-debate-analysis-20150807-story.html", "Author": "[David Lauter]"}

But he also indicated that Republicans would try to attach conditions to an increase., \"I made it very clear after the November election that were certainly not going to shut down the government or default on the national debt,\" McConnell said on CBSs \"Face the Nation.\" \"We will figure some way to handle that.

John Kitzhabers resignation caps months of growing concerns, ------------, FOR THE RECORD, An earlier version of this post referred to Kitzhabers 2010 inauguration. After being elected to a third term in 2010, he was inaugurated in 2011., ------------, The demand for records was issued to the Oregon Department of Administrative Services and seeks all information, records, and documents for both Hayes and Kitzhaber., Kitzhaber announced his resignation Friday, ending weeks of speculation about whether he could lead Oregon with at least two investigations into possible ethical breaches hanging over his head., Questions about Hayes, 47, a clean energy consultant, have dogged the couple for months, but only over the past week did it become clear that they would bring a swift and agonizing end to Kitzhabers 35-year career in public service., The federal subpoena also seeks emails sent or received by Hayes, Kitzhaber, Kitzhaber government attorney Liani Reeves and the head of the Department of Administrative Services., Email records were requested from 13 others who were either employed by or had dealings with the state, including a woman who worked for a short time as a communications staffer for the governor and was fired, in part, for questioning Hayes role in the administration., The federal probe had been rumored for weeks. It joins a state ethics investigation and a third inquiry led by the Oregon Department of Justice., The subpoena seeks information about Hayes dealings with energy contracts, and also demands information between state employees and several non-governmental bodies including Demos, a New York-based research and policy center that paid Hayes to serve as its advocate while Hayes also pushed its agenda forward as the governors energy advisor., Kitzhabers resignation, which is effective Wednesday, was sent in a letter submitted to Secretary of State Kate Brown, who is expected to succeed him., I am announcing today that I will resign as governor of the state of Oregon, he wrote in a statement released just after noon., It is not in my nature to walk away from a job I have undertaken - it is to stand and fight for the cause. For that reason I apologize to all those people who gave of their faith, time, energy and resources to elect me to a fourth term last year and who have supported me over the past three decades., Poised to become the next governor, Brown called for unity amid the turmoil of recent weeks., \"This is a sad day for Oregon. But I am confident that legislators are ready to come together to move Oregon forward,\" Brown said., \"I know you all have a lot of questions, and I will answer them as soon as possible. As you can imagine, there is a lot of work to be done between now and Wednesday,\" she said., The embattled governor faces allegations that his fiancee used their relationship to win contracts for her consulting business and failed to report income on her taxes. The states two top legislative leaders and the state treasurer -- all Democrats, as is the 67-year-old governor -- had called on Kitzhaber on Thursday to resign., Brown was poised to move to the governors office, but will have to run in 2016. In a statement, Treasurer Ted Wheeler noted the looming election., I have been around long enough to know that the resignation of Gov. Kitzhaber and the constitutional mandate for an election in 2016 will set off a flurry of speculation about what happens next,\" he said., \"There will be a time for politics, but now is not that time. In the coming days, Oregonians should pull together to support Gov. Brown and her team in their efforts to bring stability to the governors office.\", Wheeler went on to thank Kitzhaber for his service., \"I wish him the very best in the years ahead. Oregonians are a resilient people, and I am certain that we will emerge from this difficult period as a stronger and more unified state, he said., The associations representing Democratic and Republican governors agreed that Kitzhaber was right to step down, but differed sharply on what happens next. The Democratic group praised Brown while the Republicans called for new leadership in 2016., Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a fellow Democrat, praised Kitzhaber, a medical doctor, for his service, particularly in the area of public health., \"Gov. Kitzhaber had an incredible career of public service in Oregon. His work in particular on healthcare helped lead the transformation of our nations healthcare system,\" Inslee said. \"This is a sad end to Gov. Kitzhabers tenure, but his strong record of leadership and vision is worthy of respect., On Monday, state Atty. Gen. Ellen F. Rosenblum announced in a three-sentence letter to Kitzhaber that she had begun a criminal investigation into the troubled first couple. The state Ethics Commission was already investigating whether Hayes had falsified tax forms and been paid consulting fees to influence her future husband, and just what Kitzhabers involvement had been., In a statement, Rosenblum too thanked Kitzhaber for his service but noted that the resignation will not end the inquiries., The governors decision to resign will not affect our ongoing criminal investigation into allegations of his and Ms. Hayes conduct,\" Rosenblum said. \"Oregonians deserve nothing less than a full and fair investigation of all the facts, as well as the opportunity to reach a resolution that will truly allow our state to move forward., On Tuesday, Kitzhaber sat down with Peter Courtney, president of the state Senate and a longtime friend and colleague, and said he planned to step down, ending his historic fourth term after just a month., He also called Secretary of State Kate Brown, who was in Washington, D.C., for a conference, and summoned her back to Oregon for an emergency, private meeting., On Wednesday, Brown hopped on a plane. But when she was escorted into the governors office, Kitzhaber asked her why she was there. He later announced, emphatically and for the third time in less than two weeks, that he had no plans to resign., Thursday came the political bombshells. Courtney and Tina Kotek, speaker of the state House of Representatives, had met late into the evening Wednesday and finally decided that they had no choice but to demand Kitzhabers resignation., The chaos in the Capitol had been threatening the workings of the Beaver State, where the legislature was in session, executive appointments had to be made, Courtney said, and the \"disruption\" was agonizing., \"Thats what makes this so significant,\" Courtney said Thursday. Beyond asking for Kitzhabers resignation, \"we have no powers. What am I going to do? Im not going to stop committees from meeting. Im not going to stop the session., And then on Thursday, Courtney read the statement that he had written for the day Kitzhaber would resign. The emotional state Senate president and longtime Kitzhaber friend didnt know it at the time, but he was a day premature., \"No public servant has given more to Oregon,\" Courtney said after cataloging the former emergency room doctors long history in public service -- as a state representative, a state senator, president of the state Senate and 12 years in the governors office, \"longer than anyone else.\", \"There is another side,\" Courtney continued. \"He is a friend. He is a son. He is a brother. He is a father. He is a human being. It is all these things for which I hope that he is remembered. I hope all these things are his legacy. He deserves that. Gov. John Albert Kitzhaber MD, Im sorry. I know that together Oregon and her people will get through this.\", State House Republican Leader Mike McLane said it was a sad day for Oregon. I take no delight in John Kitzhabers resignation but understand his decision, McLane said in a statement., The Capitol was a strange mix of somber and festive in the hours leading up to Kitzhabers Friday the 13th announcement. On Saturday, Oregon would be celebrating statehood, and the Oregon Wheat Commission had brought big sheetcakes that proclaimed, \"Happy Birthday Oregon 156.\", State Archivist Mary Beth Herkert had set up shop under the rotunda, one floor below the beleaguered governors ceremonial offices. She flipped the pages of the original Oregon Constitution, a supple document that prepared the state for days just like this one., Article V, Section 8a sets out the line of succession should a sitting governor resign: Secretary of state. State treasurer. President of the state Senate. Several governors before Kitzhaber had resigned, but none did so under a cloud., \"Its amazing all the stuff that they covered in it,\" Herkert said of the constitutional convention and its end result. \"Good and bad.\", Kitzhaber had managed to survive the 11th-hour revelation that his fiancee and decade-long companion had entered into a fraudulent green-card marriage in 1997, receiving $5,000 to wed an Ethiopian national so that he could stay in the country., But he could not survive the deepening scandal., maria.laganga@latimes.com, Follow @marialagangaon Twitter, , 6:42 p.m. This story has been updated with information about the federal subpoena, 2:38 p.m.: This story has been updated with comments from Kate Brown, set to become Oregons next governor., 2:02 p.m.: This story has been updated with comments from the governor of Washington., 1:34 p.m.: This story has been updated with a statement that the governors resignation will not end ethics investigations., 1:16 p.m.: This story has been updated with reaction from political figures., 12:57 p.m.: This story has been updated with reaction from the minority leader., 12:32 p.m.: This story has been updated with additional details about actions leading up to the governors resignation., 12:27 p.m.: This story has been updated with details of the governors resignation., It was initially published at 10:20 a.m.]", "Date": "20150213", "Title": "[Federal subpoena seeks Oregon state records concerning Gov.

South Dakota and West Virginia round out the list of the top 10., In 2007, when Pew last conducted a major survey of Americas religious beliefs, no state had more than about one in four adult residents who described themselves as either atheists, agnostics or religiously \"nothing in particular.\", The current study, conducted last summer and released Tuesday, found several states where the share has climbed to roughly one in three adults, including the four in New England as well as Oregon, Washington and Alaska. In Vermont and New Hampshire, almost four in 10 adults are \"nones.\", The shift has been dramatic in some states. In Massachusetts, the share of adults without a religion increased 15 percentage points in the seven years between the two surveys, the largest increase of any state. In Idaho, the share of secular adults grew 11 points. New York state saw a 10-point increase., At the other end of the spectrum, only one state, West Virginia, saw an actual decrease in the percentage of secular residents, a one-point decline., Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama, the three states with the largest share of Christian adults, were also at the top of that list in 2007. In all three, the share of adults with no religion grew, although from a low level. Mississippi went from 6% \"none\" to 14%, while Alabama and Louisiana increased from 8% each to 12% and 13% respectively., The study, which surveyed 35,000 adult Americans, has a margin of error of +/- 0.6% for the full national sample.

{"Content": "[[, The U.S. has become significantly less Christian in recent years as the share of American adults who espouse no systematic religious belief increased sharply, a major new study found., For what is probably the first time in U.S. history, the number of American Christians has declined. Christianity, however, remains by far the nations dominant religious tradition, according to the new report by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center., The erosion in traditional religious ranks seems likely to continue. Among Americans aged 18 to 33, slightly more than half identify as Christian, compared with roughly 8 in 10 in the baby boom generation and older age groups, the new data show., Moreover, in a reverse of previous patterns, younger Americans do not appear to be adhering more to traditional faiths as they become parents. Just the opposite seems to be happening  members of the millennial generation have grown less religious as they age., The rapid increase in the number of adults without ties to traditional religious institutions has strong implications for other social institutions and for politics., Whether a person attends religious services regularly is among the strongest predictors of how he or she will vote, with traditional religion strongly tied to the Republican Party, at least among white Americans., The decline in traditional religious belief adds to the demographic challenges facing the GOP, which already faces difficulties because of its reliance on white voters in a country that has grown more racially diverse., The interaction between religion and politics may work both ways. Some scholars believe that close ties between traditional religion and conservatism, particularly on issues such as same-sex marriage, have led many younger Americans to cut ties with organized religion., Opposition to same-sex marriage on the part of religious conservatives is turning off so many people from Christianity, said Phil Zuckerman, a sociology professor at Pitzer College who specializes in studying secularism. Were seeing a backlash against the linking of religion and politics., Almost 1 in 5 American adults was raised in a religious tradition but is now unaffiliated, the study found. By contrast, only 4% have moved in the other direction., A leading conservative religious figure, however, said the survey results could be a positive development. People who once would have been pretend Christian are being more honest about their beliefs, said Russell Moore, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention., Churches should not try to water down their beliefs on issues such as marriage to appeal to a broader audience, he said. Almost-Christianity not only isnt authentic; its dangerous to peoples souls., I think this gives us a great opportunity for the church to free itself from its American civic religion captivity and to be the church again, Moore said. The worst thing we can do is respond to the changing culture with pandering., Because the U.S. Census does not ask questions about religion, the Pew Research Centers massive religion surveys have become a chief source of information on the religious landscape., The current survey questioned 35,071 U.S. adults last summer. Its huge size allows detailed analysis of even fairly small religious groups. The margin of error for the full sample is plus or minus six-tenths of a percentage point., The study found the U.S. still far more religious than most other economically advanced countries. But the significant increase in the share of Americans who do not follow traditional religious belief mirrors trends in Europe and elsewhere., Its becoming much more possible, much more viable, to identify as secular in the U.S. today, Zuckerman said. In previous generations, a lack of religious affiliation was widely viewed as un-American, he said., Nationwide, just short of a quarter of Americans describe themselves as agnostic, atheist or simply nothing in particular, up from roughly 1 in 6 in 2007, according to the new study. The ranks of the nones, as the study labels them, have grown in large part from people abandoning the religions in which they were raised., That trend toward more secularism is particularly strong in the West, where unaffiliated is now the single largest religious grouping, at 28%, compared with 23% who identify as Catholic, 22% evangelical Protestant and 11% as mainline Protestant, the Pew data show. The South remains the most heavily Christian part of the nation., In the Los Angeles metropolitan region, roughly one-quarter of adults are unaffiliated and about one-third are Catholic, the data show. Two other large Western metropolitan regions, Seattle and San Francisco, rank as the most secular of the countrys largest urban areas, with more than one-third of adults having no religious affiliation., Although younger Americans are much more likely to have no religion than older generations, the decline in organized religious belief has affected nearly all population groups  native-born and immigrant; whites, blacks and Latinos; and those with and without college educations, the Pew data found., The decline has been sharpest among Americans born since the mid-1960s. And in those groups, organized religion does not appear to be gaining adherents as people age. In 2007, for example, about one-quarter of Americans aged 18 to 26 said they had no religion. Today, in that same cohort  who are now 25 to 33  just over one-third say they have no religion., If you work in the church, you see it happening. We have growing numbers of congregations that are having a hard time retaining their membership numbers, said Bishop R. Guy Erwin of the Southwest California Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, based in Glendale., The people who are churchgoers are an aging generation, and theyre not being replaced by younger people, he said. We cant just assume that we can do the same old stuff and still be successful., Married people are more likely to have a religious affiliation than the unmarried, but both groups have grown less attached to organized religion in recent years, the Pew data show. Among married adults, 18% describe themselves as religious nones, while among the unmarried, 28% do. Those who are unmarried but living with a partner are particularly likely to be unaffiliated., With the growth of the religiously unaffiliated, Christian ranks have eroded. Roughly 173 million adult Americans identified as Christian when asked last year. Thats just under 71% of the U.S. population, down from 178 million, or 78% of the U.S., in 2007. The total U.S. adult population grew by about 8% during that seven-year period., Protestants once dominated the U.S. population, but no longer hold a majority, the study found. About 47% of the U.S. population identifies with some Protestant denomination, down from slightly more than half in 2007., The decline has been uneven, with mainline denominations, such as Methodists and Presbyterians, shrinking more quickly than evangelical churches., Slightly fewer than 1 in 6 adult Americans identifies with a mainline Protestant church, according to the survey. Evangelicals, by contrast, make up about one-quarter of the adult U.S. population. They now constitute a majority among those who identify as Protestant., ------------, FOR THE RECORD, May 12, 7:25 p.m.: An earlier version of this article described changes over the last eight years. The survey was taken last summer, seven years after the previous poll., May 12, 11:35 a.m.: An earlier version of this article stated that evangelicals form a majority among those Americans who identify as Christian, according to the Pew survey. Evangelicals form a majority among those Americans who identify as Protestant, according to the survey., -------------, An additional 7% of American adults identify with historically black Protestant churches, a share that has remained relatively stable., Catholics, who represent about 1 in 5 Americans, also have seen some decline in numbers since 2007, the study found, although some other studies have found a recent uptick. Almost 13% of American adults are former Catholics  the largest single group of people who have left a faith in which they were raised., Among non-Christian faiths, Judaism remains the largest in the U.S., although only about 2% of the U.S. population identifies as Jewish. The share is up very slightly from what the survey found in 2007., Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism each have less than 1% of the U.S. population, although the Muslim and Hindu populations have grown rapidly, reflecting emigration from Asia. Among immigrants who have arrived in the U.S. since 1990, almost 1 in 6 identifies with a non-Christian faith., For more on policy and politics, follow@DavidLauter on Twitter, ALSO:, Opinion: Pope Francis and the gospel of election reform, Coercive federal power threatens religious liberty, Jeb Bush says, Opinion: Can kids be good without God?

{"Content": "[[, The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case challenging Wisconsins voter identification law Monday, making way for the state to require voters to show photo ID at the polls three years after the law was put on hold in a protracted legal battle., The law will not be enforced immediately: It is too late to implement the voter ID requirement for the states April 7 election, Wisconsin Atty. Gen. Brad Schimel said in a statement, because absentee ballots are already in the hands of voters. But, Schimel added, the voter ID law will be in place for future elections -- this decision is final., The law requires nearly all voters to have a state drivers license or U.S. passport with a current photo., This is great news for Wisconsin voters, Gov. Scott Walker said in a statement. As weve said, this is a common sense reform that protects the integrity of our voting process, making it easy to vote and hard to cheat., Walker, a Republican, backed the bills passage and signed it into law in 2011., Voting rights advocates, including the American Civil Liberties Union, have disagreed with the governors perspective, arguing that the requirement could disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of voters, including minorities and low-income and elderly voters who dont drive and may not have valid ID., Last year, state officials made it easier for residents without birth certificates to obtain an ID at little or no cost, Reid Magney, a spokesman for Wisconsins Government Accountability Board, told The Times on Monday., For now, the voters of Wisconsin will be able to cast their ballots free from the burdens placed on them by this law, said Dale Ho, director of the ACLUs Voting Rights Project, which filed a lawsuit challenging the law., But this should be the case for voters permanently, not just for one election, Ho said in a statement. We are evaluating our next steps in the fight for the right of all Americans to vote free from unnecessary barriers.\", In April 2014, U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman ruled that the law was unconstitutional because it imposed an unfair burden on the poor and minorities, saying that as many as 300,000 Wisconsin voters could be deterred from casting ballots. In September, a three-judge panel of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Adelmans ruling, noting that the U.S. Supreme Court had upheld a comparable Indiana law in 2008., In October, the full 7th Circuit Court deadlocked on the case in a 5-5 vote that allowed the three-judge panels ruling to stand., The Supreme Court weighed in a week later, saying it was too late to try to implement the law for the November election, and blocked state officials from implementing it while the high court pondered whether to take the case., Wisconsin already required citizens to submit their drivers license or state ID numbers -- or the last four digits of their Social Security number -- on voter registration forms., The state also already required voters to provide proof of residence at the polls, but it did not have to be photo ID: College identification, utility bills and residential leases were also acceptable for that purpose., After the April 7 election, voters will have to produce a valid state ID card or drivers license to pick up their ballot at the polls, or send in a photocopy of their ID when requesting an absentee ballot, said Magney, of the state Government Accountability Board. The board oversees state elections., The state has acknowledged that it may take weeks for residents who were born outside of Wisconsin to obtain a birth certificate needed to process an application for an ID. The ACLU and other activists have argued that for voters whose documents include clerical errors or other issues, it could take even longer., The process can take time, the Government Accountability Board said in a statement Monday, so it makes sense to get started early., Wisconsin election officials say there are likely to be special elections this year in which officials may enforce the law.

{"Content": "[[, The visit had all the trappings of a full-fledged presidential campaign: a speech at the state Democratic convention, a pep talk to door-knocking volunteers, breakfast with labor leaders, appearances alongside the partys candidate for governor., The only thing absent was a formal announcement by Martin OMalley that he was, in fact, seeking the White House in 2016. But unlike a certain other much-chronicled, vastly better-known prospect, Marylands two-term governor makes it no secret that, if not officially running for president, he is at least actively striding in that direction., Fellow Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton says she hasnt decided whether to run, and neither, OMalley says, has he. In the meantime, he is running one of the most vigorous noncampaign campaigns of any 2016 possibility in either party  raising money, stumping in early-voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, traveling abroad to boost his foreign policy credentials and honing a message that might be characterized, for brevitys sake, as compassionate competence., \"People want problem-solvers,\" OMalley, a former Baltimore mayor, said in a late-night interview after the first of two well-received speeches to Democratic activists in Des Moines. \"They want leaders that will bring people together to solve problems, not people that will take their ideology and try to beat round pegs into square holes.\", Noted for his data-driven approach to policy, starting when he used computer analysis to chart citizen complaints and fuel millions of dollars of new efficiencies in city government, OMalley is a devout Roman Catholic grounded in the Jesuit emphasis on social justice. His religious faith, he suggests, informs his secular beliefs., \"The numbers arent abstractions,\" he said of his reverence for statistics. \"The numbers are very real human beings and individual stories.\", Like many native to the information age, OMalley is fluent in the language of entrepreneurship, multiplatforms and changing technologies. His numbers-crunching success fighting crime, cleaning Chesapeake Bay and shaping up Marylands bureaucracy could be a model for the federal government, he says, though it may be a challenge translating that into a resonant rallying cry: At times OMalley can sound like a walking PowerPoint slide, holding forth on \"silos of human endeavor\" and \"a cadence of accountability.\", His record is one to make liberals swoon, even if he prefers the less-freighted \"progressive\" label., Under OMalley, Maryland has banished the death penalty, toughened gun laws, raised the minimum wage, and approved same-sex marriage, the use of medical marijuana and in-state tuition at public colleges and universities for people in the country illegally., He has also, as Republicans are eager to point out, pushed through numerous tax hikes, including increases in Marylands sales, gasoline and tobacco taxes as well a boost in the income tax on better-off residents., OMalley parries criticism by touting the states enviable record on job creation, income growth and other yardsticks of economic well-being., \"Hope drives belief. Belief drives action. And action achieves results,\" he said in his speech to delegates at the state Democratic convention, a mix of partisan exhortation, self-promotion and the maxims one might hear at a business administration seminar., Should he run for president, OMalleys job performance, starting in 1991 as a member of the Baltimore City Council, would obviously be examined in great detail. A corruption, sex and drug scandal in Baltimores city jail, which festered when he was governor, is a particularly troublesome part of the OMalley record. More recently, his claims to competence have been undercut by Marylands troubled Obamacare exchange, which failed at an estimated cost of well over $100 million., A lawyer by training, OMalley has spent a lifetime steeped in politics. He grew up one of six children in the prosperous Maryland suburbs of Washington, where his parents met at national Democratic Party headquarters., OMalley and his wife, Katie, met in similar fashion, on the campaign trail. The daughter of J. Joseph Curran Jr., the longest-serving attorney general in Maryland history, she is now a state district court judge., Informed opinion is divided over whether OMalley will ultimately follow through and mount an uphill challenge to Clinton. (If she opts out, the Democratic contest will be thrown wide-open.), He enjoys a good personal relationship with the former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of State, whom he supported over Barack Obama in 2008, and said in the interview that he had \"a great deal of respect ... a great deal of admiration\" for Clinton., Iowa, as he knows, would be an ideal testing ground for both., In 1984, an upstart Gary Hart nearly wrestled the Democratic nomination away from former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, a commanding front-runner at the time, much as Clinton is today. The Colorado senator began with a surprisingly strong performance in the Iowa caucuses; one of his state volunteers was a young OMalley., Seeing Harts experience up close \"sort of demystified that a bit for me,\" OMalley said of seeking the White House, \"and made me realize that real human beings offer themselves in this service.\", He has not pressed the generational argument, but his appearance  vigorous, fit, handsome in a plain-vanilla way and just 51 years old, compared with Clinton, who is 66  means he doesnt have to. Others draw the contrast for him., \"Its really about young, up-and-coming Democrats,\" said Rose Mary Pratt, 66, a retired state worker who turned out on a sunny Saturday morning to hear OMalley address a group of Democratic canvassers in Beaverdale, one of Des Moines most liberal neighborhoods. \"Im Hillarys generation. Im looking for whos our replacement material.\", Deciding whether to seek the White House, OMalley said over the 10 p.m. din of a hotel lounge, involves a characteristically methodical approach: \"Multiple conversations. A lot of reading. A lot of listening. Some talking. But mostly listening.\", Hart, who has kept in touch with OMalley since leaving the Senate, offered his take from his law office in Denver., Whatever the odds, \"if he believes that he has something to offer and a unique point of view, of course\" he should run in 2016, Hart said in a telephone interview. \"Why not?\", mark.barabak@latimes.com, Twitter: @markzbarabak]", "Date": "20140712", "Title": "[Martin O'Malley warms up in Iowa for possible Democratic run in 2016]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-martin-omalley-president-2016-20140713-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, The White House on Monday delivered a starkly negative assessment of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnells ability to deliver on his promises, faulting him for an unconscionable delay of President Obamas choice for attorney general and inept leadership that threatens a bipartisan trafficking bill., White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest accused McConnell of breaking his commitment to give fair consideration to Loretta Lynch, Obamas nominee for attorney general, and urged Republicans to stop \"playing politics\" with the post., There is no question that Republicans are playing politics with the nomination of the nations top law enforcement official, and it should come to an end, he said., In unusually pointed criticism of a congressional leader, Earnest also faulted McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, for a dispute over abortion that threatens to derail the otherwise bipartisan, popular bill to address sex trafficking., Before the new Congress convened in January, the question of whether Obama and McConnell could forge a strong partnership was seen as key to the prospect of any major bipartisan legislation. When the two met after Novembers midterm elections, both parties expressed confidence that they could find common ground on areas like trade and tax reform despite political differences on a host of other issues., The relationship appears to already have hit a low. On Sunday, McConnell said on CNN that a vote to confirm Lynch could be delayed if Democrats continue to block further consideration of the trafficking bill. McConnell noted that Senate Democrats could have moved to confirm Lynch, now the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, when they still controlled the Senate last fall., In response, Earnest noted that Obama, in a show of good faith, had agreed to McConnells request that consideration of Lynch be put off until this year. Earnest called it \"unconscionable\" that Lynch, whose nomination was recommended by the Senate Judiciary Committee last month, still has yet to receive an up-or-down vote by the full chamber., \"I get asked a lot about whether or not Sen. McConnell was a man of his word and whether or not hes willing to live up to commitments that he makes to the president of the United States,\" Earnest said. \"For him to suggest that, Well, it hasnt been that long, because Senate Democrats delayed introducing her until after the first of the year, thats not a very good sign of faith.\", Earnest also held McConnell responsible for the impasse over abortion that has tied up what was expected to be swift approval of a bipartisan bill to give law enforcement new tools to target human trafficking and establish a $30-million victims fund., Democrats say Republicans slipped in a provision to block the fund from being used to pay for abortion services without their knowledge. Republicans counter that Democrats should have been paying closer attention to the legislative language., Earnest said McConnell should drop the abortion language to allow the bill to proceed, mocking the GOP for taking a \"common-sense\" bill and turning \"it into partisan controversy.\", \"That is not a reflection of a flaw in the bill. Its a reflection of inept leadership,\" he said. \"The fact that Leader McConnell cant build bipartisan support for a child sex-trafficking bill, I think is an indication that his leadership here in the majority is not off to a very strong start.\", For more White House coverage, follow @mikememoli.]", "Date": "20150316", "Title": "[White House attacks McConnell over impasses on Capitol Hill]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-white-house-mcconnell-20150316-story.html", "Author": "[Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, The window for President Obama to add another liberal justice to the Supreme Court probably closed last week when Republicans took control of the Senate., Over the last 10 years, the Senates vote on high court nominees has increasingly followed party lines. Republican senators lined up against Obamas first two nominees  Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan  but lacked the votes to block them., Now, they will have the majority to stop any nominee, particularly one with a liberal record., The shift in power is likely to persuade 81-year-old Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg  if she needed further persuading  that she should stay on the job at least until 2017. She had come under strong pressure to retire by next year so Obama would have time to have a replacement confirmed., But a Senate controlled by Republicans makes it highly unlikely the president could replace her with an equally strong advocate for womens rights and civil liberties. Ginsburg, the courts leading liberal voice, has said she has no plans to retire, even questioning why some liberals want her to leave., \"I asked some people, particularly the academics who said I should have stepped down last year: Who do you think the president could nominate and get through the current Senate that you would rather see on the court than me?\" she said in a recent interview in the New Republic. \"No one has given me an answer to that question.\", The new Republican majority in the Senate will also ease conservatives worries that Obama might have the chance to shift the Supreme Courts ideological balance., The nightmare scenario of some Republicans is to wake up to news that either Justice Antonin Scalia or Anthony M. Kennedy, both 78, is leaving the court due to an illness or death. Both were appointed by President Reagan in the mid-1980s., Scalia has been the courts most outspoken conservative, and Kennedy has supplied the key votes for a conservative majority to free campaign spending, strike down part of the Voting Rights Act and expand support for religious claims. Both justices also voted, in dissent, to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act., If one of them had retired in the last few years, Obama could have chosen a liberal jurist as a replacement, confident the nominee would be confirmed in a Senate controlled by Democrats., Scalia and Kennedy have voiced no hints about retiring. But if one of them were forced to leave due to health reasons, Obama would have to choose a successor who is acceptable to the new Republican majority in the Senate., The last time a Supreme Court justice nominated by a Democratic president was confirmed by a Senate Republican majority was Rufus Peckham in 1895. Thats largely because over the last century when Democrats controlled the White House they usually had a Senate majority., Most legal experts doubt there will be another vacancy on the court before the next president moves into the White House., \"None of the current members of the court seem eager to step down,\" said Todd Gaziano, who heads the Washington office of Pacific Legal Foundation, a conservative public-interest law firm., Gaziano predicts that if a seat becomes vacant in 2016 during the election campaign, the GOP-led Senate will attempt to delay a confirmation until after a new president takes office, hoping that person would be a Republican. \"I can see the Republican majority running out the clock,\" he said., The result is that the ideological balance on the court is likely to carry forward through 2016. Five of the justices were appointed by Republicans and four by Democrats. When the court is closely split, the conservatives usually have a majority, but Kennedy has joined with the liberals on several major issues, including support for gay rights., If a surprise vacancy were to come up in the next two years, Obama would have little choice but to select a nominee with a moderate and nonpartisan record., One possible candidate is Judge Sri Srinivasan, 47, who was named last year to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Srinivasan worked as a lawyer in both Republican and Democratic administrations, and even won plaudits in his Senate hearing from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). The two were Supreme Court clerks during the same year., Another possibility is Chief Judge Merrick Garland, 61, also of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals  a Clinton appointee who was the supervising prosecutor in the Oklahoma City bombing case. But some Democrats consider him too old to have a long-term impact on the court. And if Ginsburg were to leave, she almost certainly would be replaced by a woman., Nominating a minority of some kind may make it more difficult for Republicans to oppose, experts said. Liberal legal groups say that Obama, if he gets the chance to nominate another justice, should not restrict himself to only moderate choices., \"Neither the White House nor Senate Democrats should yield to the narrative of an inevitable confirmation shutdown,\" said Nan Aron, president of the Alliance for Justice, a national association of advocacy groups., Others predicted Americans would frown on a GOP campaign to reject a qualified Supreme Court candidate for purely partisan reasons., \"Efforts to block a Supreme Court nominee with excessive partisanship will be damning for the party,\" said Caroline Fredrickson, president of the liberal legal group American Constitution Society., david.savage@latimes.com, tim.phelps@latimes.com, Twitter: @DavidGSavage, @timphelpsLAT]", "Date": "20141108", "Title": "[Obama unlikely to alter Supreme Court ideology with Republican Senate]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-court-gop-20141109-story.html", "Author": "[David G.

{"Content": "[[, The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Thursday upheld state requirements that people show photo identification before being allowed to vote, the latest battle over how to regulate the polls., In a split ruling, the court backed the photo requirement, strongly pushed by Republican Gov. Scott Walker. However, there is still a pending suit on the issue which was initially struck down by a federal court in April. Earlier this week, the U.S. Justice Department filed a brief opposing the law, saying that the photo ID requirement unfairly limited participation by minority voters., Voter ID is a common sense reform that protects the integrity of our elections, Walker said in a statement. \"We look forward to the same result from the federal court of appeals., The issue of who gets to vote and under what circumstances goes to the heart of the political process, especially in the current election cycle on the federal level in which the GOP is seeking to retain control of the House of Representatives and win the Senate. There is also the presidential election coming up in 2016., In general, Democrats have sought to increase the voting base and oppose many regulations, arguing they discriminate against minorities and the elderly, both key constituencies. Republicans argue that tighter controls are needed to protect the process from voter fraud. The GOP also benefits in many cases from smaller turnouts., According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 34 states have passed laws requiring some sort of identification from voters, but only 31 of them are in effect. Like in Wisconsin, a court has struck down Pennsylvanias law, and one passed in North Carolina wont take effect until 2016., Walker signed the voter identification law in 2011. Former Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, had vetoed a similar requirement three times., On Thursday, the Wisconsin court ruled in two cases involving voter eligibility. One was brought by the League of Women Voters and the other came from the Milwaukee branch of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People and immigrant rights group Voces de la Frontera., In the NAACP case, the Supreme Court said the state cant require people to pay fees to receive state-issued ID cards. Doing so would be a severe burden on the constitutional right to vote, Justice Pat Roggensack wrote., The court ruled 4-3 in favor of the law in the NAACP case and 5-2 in the League of Women Voters lawsuit., In April, U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman struck down the photo identification law, arguing that the state couldnt prove the danger of fraud and that the law violated the U.S. Constitutions guarantee of equal protection. The case is pending before the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals., The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday sided with challengers in that case, saying that the photo ID requirement unfairly affected minority voters. The department also took a similar stand on an Ohio law that limits when voters can cast an early ballot., These filings are necessary to confront the pernicious measures in Wisconsin and Ohio that would impose significant barriers to the most basic right of our democracy, Atty.

Some proposals are not just bad, but awful, and the low barrier to entry means they occasionally get on the ballot. Witness Proposition 8, which banned gay marriage, and Proposition 187, which denied public services to illegal immigrants. Both became law but later were ruled unconstitutional., Most of the time, however, that doesnt happen. The initiative process has built-in checks and balances that usually stand in the way of silly, crazy, abusive or unconstitutional measures. Since the citizen initiative process began in 1912, only 25% of the more than 1,800 ballot proposals cleared for circulation (allowing proponents to circulate petitions and gather signatures) have qualified for the ballot. Of the 363 propositions that made it to a ballot, only 123 were approved by voters. That winnowing suggests that existing barriers prevent most faulty propositions from becoming law while protecting citizens rights to direct democracy., Yet not every one agrees. Two bills aimed at making it more difficult for the public to get propositions onto ballots are gaining traction in Sacramento., AB 1100, by Assemblymen Richard Bloom (D-Santa Monica) and Evan Low (D-Campbell), would raise the filing fee for ballot initiatives from $200 to $8,000, which they say better reflects the cost of processing a proposal. (The fee hasnt changed since 1943.) Not only is that unnecessarily steep, but cost recovery was not what prompted the legislation. It was a reaction  an overreaction, actually  to the \"Sodomite Suppression Act\" filed earlier this year by an Orange County attorney that would outlaw homosexuality and mandate execution of gay people. That proposal is so ridiculous and horrible that it has virtually no chance of gathering 365,880 signatures from registered voters to qualify for the ballot. If it reached the ballot, it wouldnt pass., Low doesnt even want laws like this to be proposed and says a higher filing fee would deter \"frivolous proposals from being submitted.\" But its not the Legislatures job to pass judgment on the merits of an initiative. Thats up to the voters. And such a high filing fee would deter worthy proposals as well as bad ones., Its not the job of the attorney general, either. But it would be under AB 884, by Assemblyman Anthony Rendon (D-Lakewood). That bill would require the attorney general to stamp a big warning on any ballot proposal she or he considers a violation of an individuals rights under the state or U.S. Constitution. Think of the surgeon generals warning on cigarette packs. The problem is that constitutionality is sometimes in the eye of the beholder, and attorneys general are political creatures who might be inclined to use this new power on behalf of the proposals they like and against the ones they dont., Both bills have passed the Assembly and are headed to the state Senate, where they ought to be viewed with great skepticism., Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinionandFacebook]", "Date": "20150529", "Title": "[Merits of ballot initiatives best left in hands of voters]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-ballot-initiative-bills-20150529-story.html", "Author": "[The Times Editorial Board]"}
{"Content": "[[, The year 2014 turned to 2015 with a fierce flip of the page, at least when it comes to national politics., The last year was dominated by a midterm election that proved to be an extravaganza for Republicans, who won control of the Senate and expanded their lock on the House. This year opens the next presidential contest, and Republicans are likely to have a much harder path to success., That is because we have become a nation divided, and a vastly different group of people shows up for off-year elections than those who vote in presidential elections., The electorate that voted in November  in big races held in predominantly red states, giving Republicans another advantage  was older, more white and more conservative than the electorate that will begin sizing up presidential candidates this year for the 2016 election. That one will be younger and more diverse, if history is any guide., Attitudinally, midterm elections are opportunities to slap down leaders who voters believe have done too much, or not done enough. Presidential elections, particularly incumbent-free ones like 2016 is going to be, are less a referendum than a choice between two new options., Still, there is a link between the two campaigns, and it centers on two perennial political issues that were in play in 2014 and will be again in 2015. One is the argument over the size of government and the tactics used to shrink it. The other is voters gut-level sense of economic well-being., In 2014, Iowa was a perfect test tube for both  just as the state will be, in 2015, the testing ground for the presidential candidates., The states marquee race in 2014 was for an open Senate seat, long held by retiring Democrat Tom Harkin. The Republican nominee was Joni Ernst, a state senator who gave herself national pizazz with her first big ad, which emphasized her heartland roots with a piquant suggestion of what shed do in Washington., \"I grew up castrating hogs on an Iowa farm, so when I get to Washington Ill know how to cut pork,\" she said in the ad. Its kicker: \"Lets make em squeal.\", Ernsts comment  delivered with a near-perfect mix of sauciness and humor  went directly to the GOPs argument for smaller government, a theme that ran through most of the races in November. For that Republican-leaning electorate, the argument encapsulated myriad complaints that President Obama has exceeded his powers and usurped Congress., Ernsts victory over a lackluster Democrat, Bruce Braley, rested on voters desire to elect someone willing to take a knife to Washington. But it also rested on the second perennial issue: their gut sense of the economy., By any numerical standard  the stock market, the unemployment rate, job offerings  the economy has improved since Obama took office in the depths of the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression., But numbers never trump fear. And in Iowa, as in so many other places, the economic recovery has been so patchy that great swaths may see improving numbers  but what they feel is persistent concern., A Los Angeles Times reporter traveling in Iowa just before Ernsts runaway win found voter after voter uneasy about the economy. \"They say its good  that it has turned around,\" said Jay Johnson, whose familys economic security rested, with some irony, on his wifes job as a foreclosure counselor. \"I guess most people just dont feel it.\", Those two elements will surface over and over again in 2015, as politicians on Capitol Hill, in statehouses and on the presidential campaign trail tussle over the role of government and the feel of the economy., In Washington, the GOP will face tension between leaders determined to show that Republicans can govern, and party members who favor more aggressive tactics, like government shutdowns. The presidential race only exaggerates the potential for conflict, since one major shutdown protagonist is Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who appears to be planning a run for the White House., Even as the economy continues to improve, the feuding parties will work to influence voters perceptions about it. Their focus  and that of each partys presidential candidates  will be middle-class voters., The White House reflected that strategy  and linked the two big issues  in the recent release of the November unemployment report, which showed the creation of a whopping 321,000 jobs, the biggest monthly tally in almost three years., \"The economy has now already added more jobs in 2014 than in any full calendar year since the late 1990s,\" said Jason Furman, chairman of the presidents Council of Economic Advisors, in December. \"To create an environment in which this progress can continue, it is critical that Congress take the basic steps needed to fund the government and avoid creating disruptive and counterproductive fiscal uncertainty.\", And, not by accident, he pitched the Democratic agenda for 2015: \"We have an opportunity to work together to support the continued growth of higher-paying jobs by investing in infrastructure, reforming the business tax code, expanding markets for Americas goods and services, making common-sense reforms to the immigration system, and increasing the minimum wage.\", Republicans brushed aside the jobs numbers as meaningless., \"Creating 300,000 jobs in one month shouldnt be a new high; it should be the minimum we expect,\" said Republican National Committee chief Reince Priebus. Priebus, too, touted a 2015 agenda with a nod to the partys Senate takeover: \"Next year we can begin passing the pro-growth, pro-jobs legislation that has gone nowhere in the Democrat Senate.... Soon it will be up to President Obama to decide if he wants to stand with American workers, or continue siding with liberal special interests.\", cathleen.decker@latimes.com, Twitter: @cathleendecker]", "Date": "20150103", "Title": "[U.S. politics shift out of midterm mode in 2015, but 2014 issues remain]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-year-ahead-politics-20150104-story.html", "Author": "[Cathleen Decker]"}
{"Content": "[[, There are weeks in which it feels like the past and present are collapsing into themselves. For those following California politics, this week was one of them., Donald Trump was bringing his road show to Wednesdays presidential debate at the Reagan library in Simi Valley, with a stop in Dallas before Tuesday nights visit to a former battleship in San Pedro., California politicians, meantime, were scrambling to grab onto Trump in whatever fashion possible, attaching themselves to the man who is utterly in control of the political ecosystem., Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom uncorkeda witty animated video attacking Trumps immigration plan., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, Mocking Trump as \"Mr. Make America Great Again\"the theme of the New York real estate magnates campaign--Newsom criticized Trumps demand that the United States build a wall along the southern border, deport 11 million or so immigrants here without proper papers, and restrict citizenship rights of children of those in the country illegally., \"Trumps plan will be a disaster and Ill debate that at any time,\" Newsom said., Of course he wouldhe couldnt pay enough money for the attention it would bring his 2018 campaign for governor., As would Isadore Hall, the state senator running for a South Bay congressional seat being given up by Democrat Janice Hahn. He announced Monday that he would demand on Tuesdayoutside the Trump event aboard the battleship Iowathat the state divest itself of any investments in anything Trump-related, including real estate in which hes involved., Not to be outflanked, Halls opponent, Nanette Barragan, floated a video of her own, dismissing Trumps \"offensive views and insults\" to women, immigrants \"and anyone else you happen to be thinking about at any particular time.\", In a nod to Trumps criticism of his competitor Jeb Bushs use of Spanish, she added: \"And one more thing. Aqu en California, muchos Americanos, como yo hablamos espaol. Si no te gusta eso, te invitamos a que te vayas. In case you didnt understand that, it means: Here in California, a lot of Americans speak Spanish. If you dont like that, youre welcome to leave.\", There is a political and media lesson here. Hall and Barragan and Newsom were fixed on Trump, of course, because he is where the cameras and the attention reside at this point in the campaign. (Newsoms attack on Trumps plans stood to get a lot more attention than his recent Twitter fight with another 2016 presidential candidate, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, currently residing at the bottom of the presidential polls.), On Monday, two days before the debate, sponsor CNN added to its screen a to-the-second countdown clock, which ticked throughout the approximately one-hour-long speech by Trump in Dallas that the network also aired, almost in its entirety. It was that gift of free publicity, denied other candidates, that was enticing as could be to politicians like Hall and Barragan and Newsom., Trump may be an odd mash-up of carnival barker, siren of the economically threatened and stock car driver careening out of control, but he does have a precedent, at least in California., As a candidate, theres probably no better comparison than Arnold Schwarzenegger, who stepped away from Hollywood in 2003 to run for governor in the recall election. (In a casting epiphany, NBC announced Monday that Trumps replacement as host of TVs \"Celebrity Apprentice\" would be, ta da! Schwarzenegger.), When he ran in 2003, Schwarzenegger put together comicalbut politically effectivestagecraft. A giant spigot rained red water down to symbolize the free-flowing state budget. A crane dropped a nearly two-ton weight onto an unfortunate Oldsmobile Cutlass to demonstrate what Arnold would do to the car registrationtax., The two candidates share a certain visual similarity, both faces featuring skin of a peculiar orange sheentelevision make-up?and carefully constructed hairdos. Trump had Youre Fired, Arnold had Hasta la vista, baby. Trump maligned womenmost recently his competitor Carly Fiorina, whose face he mocked to a reporter for Rolling Stone. Schwarzenegger was accused by more than a dozen women, in Los Angeles Times stories published before the election, of having fondled or groped them over the years. Both men chose the same theme song: Twisted Sisters Were Not Gonna Take It., But more than that, they exuded other things: a defiant toughness against the worlds problems, and an in-your-face disgust toward establishment politics, disdained here then and nationally now by many of the same groups of people., Schwarzeneggers act grew oldwhat came across as bravado in the beginning began to look like bullying after a time. And that was for an entertainer-turned-politician with far more policy coherence and, stunningly, political gravitas than Trump has yet exhibited., But Arnold never lost his public confidence, the same kind of public confidence that Trump exudes now. As he said Tuesday in Dallas, during a rambling speech that, while off-the-rails narcissistic, was also applauded feverishly by a huge crowd, this is a movement thats happening., Were sick and tired of whats happening, and its going to change, he said., For political news and analysis, follow me on Twitter: @cathleendecker .

{"Content": "[[, There is little that Hillary Rodham Clinton could have said or done to instantly quell the controversy surrounding her private email account and, by that meager standard, Tuesdays 20-minute news conference lived up to expectations., Supporters will seize upon her repeated assertions that she fully complied with every rule that I was governed by in defending the Democratic presidential front-runner and asserting that she is the victim of a partisan smear campaign., Clinton said working from the personal account while serving as secretary of State was a matter of convenience and repeatedly insisted that she has turned over every government communication so it could be made public by the State Department  save thousands of private emails she said she chose to delete. Those, she said, pertained to matters such as her daughters wedding, her mothers funeral and her yoga routine., Trust me, she essentially said, a fraught proposition at a time when so much of the public has so little faith in government. And an invitation that is all the more perilous given her familys mine-strewn political history., Critics were quick to seize upon Clintons legalistic statements  shades of the parsing done by President Clinton in the lead-up to his impeachment  to suggest the former first ladys session raised more questions than it answered., They mocked her suggestion that it was too much hassle to deal with two email accounts and to carry separate cellular devices for each. They pointed to inconsistencies between her actions and those of others serving in the Obama administration. They cited her body language, suggesting it telegraphed discomfort and hinted there were things she was hiding., More worrisome, an invitation to swear an oath and discuss the matter before Republicans on Capitol Hill seems certain  in the form of a subpoena, if necessary., The reaction had afamiliar to-their-corners feel, especially for any who remember the Clinton White House years. In fact, the controversy so far has done little to shake the former first ladys standing among Democratic voters, who overwhelmingly support her all-but-announced bid for the White House., A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll conducted as the episode was unfolding last week found that nearly 9 in 10 Democrats could see themselves backing Clinton for president, strong affirmation that cut across all subsets within the party: men and women, liberals and conservatives, white and minorities., Kathy Sullivan, a former head of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, spoke for many party activists when she brushed aside the controversy as a stew of Republican vengeance and media hype., If Hillary Clinton was seen jaywalking some Republican would call for an investigation, said Sullivan, a Manchester attorney. , But a presidential campaign operates on multiple levels or, seen another way, in concentric circles, starting with the innermost layer of operatives, donors and political reporters who flyspeck the candidates and judge their actions in minute detail., It is their conclusions that tend to shape broader perceptions and it was largely that audience of opinion-makers that Clinton addressed in her news conference at the United Nations, which was attended by scores of reporters and broadcast live on several TV networks., More than two decades ago, Bill Clintons operation perfected the notion of rapid response after the 1988 presidential campaign when Democrat Michael Dukakis lost in good part because he refused to address political attacks he judged foolish or inconsequential., Hillary Clintons comparatively laggard reaction to the email controversy, allowing more than a week to pass before she offered a substantive response, contributed to concern among party professionals that her political operation had gone rusty  or, worse, was maladapted to the 24/7 demands of todays campaign world., Those watching closely  by nature not your typical voter  saw worrisome signs that Clinton was repeating some of the mistakes that undermined her 2008 presidential bid, relying on a coterie of loyalists who reinforced her hostility toward the media and instinct to hunker down and lash out rather than open up. The absence of a formal campaign structure, which awaits a Clinton declaration of candidacy, contributed to the slow response, Shades of deja vu again, said one Capitol Hill veteran of more than 25 years, speaking anonymously about the serial upheavals, including controversies over the Clintons personal finances and the secretive drafting of failed healthcare legislation, that roiled her husbands administration. It just brings flashbacks to all sorts of bad situations., Others worried that Clinton, who has limited her appearances to paid speeches and mostly friendly interlocutors since stepping down two years ago as secretary of State, would be ill-prepared for the kicking and clawing of a campaign., She did little to engender good will, or bat away questions about her openness, by scheduling her news conference on short notice at the U.N., an especially hard-to-access, high-security venue. (Clintons appearance followed a speech she delivered there on womens empowerment.), But her demeanor was cool and crisply efficient, even if the smile she flashed often seemed forced. She abruptly cut off the news conference after answering fewer than a dozen questions  several of them multi-partleaving many more hanging in the air., None of which suggests Clinton is likely to be denied the Democratic nomination because of the current controversy., Many Democrats have come to the conclusion that the former New York senator and secretary of State is by far the strongest candidate the party can field in 2016. Some believe that enthusiastically, others resignedly so., As such, there is a willingness to overlook, or at least accept, the roller-coaster drama and controversies that for decades have attended the nations most powerful and prominent Democratic family  taking, as it were, the good with the bad., Nobodys perfect, said Lou DAllesandro, a Democratic state senator and longtime Clinton ally in New Hampshire, which hosts the first presidential primary. Theyve made a contribution to the country, theyve stepped up to the plate, theyve done it repeatedly and I think the country is the beneficiary., Yes, DAllesandro said, for one reason or another the Clintons have visited many of their political problems upon themselves., But, he succinctly concluded, You take the leopard with their spots., mark.barabak@latimes.com, You dont need special access to follow  @markzbarabak fornational & California politics]", "Date": "20150310", "Title": "[Hillary Rodham Clinton news conference won't end email controversy]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-hillary-clinton-emails-analysis-20150310-story.html", "Author": "[Mark Z.

{"Content": "[[, There is only one woman on the 15-member Los Angeles City Council., Statewide, women have been losing ground at other elected levels., But the emerging field of potential candidates for next years Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors election raises the odds that women could capture a majority of seats for the first time ever., Some see that prospect as a major milestone in a state where both U.S. senators are women but where representation in lower offices is lagging., Currently, 67 of the 296 county boards of supervisors seats in the state are held by women, according California Women Lead, a nonprofit, nonpartisan association of female officeholders., \"Women do approach issues differently and they draw attention to different issues because of their life experiences,\" said Rachel Michelin, chief executive of the group. In addition, she said, they serve as role models that \"can inspire more women to think about running for public office.\", When Rep. Janice Hahn (D-Los Angeles) announced her candidacy last week for the 4th District seat that Supervisor Don Knabe must relinquish due to term limits, she became a top challenger in a field that already has two others with local political experience., Also, Kathryn Barger, the top deputy to Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich, is running  with Antonovichs endorsement  to succeed the north county supervisor who has held office for 35 years. No one else has declared yet in the race, but the rare, open position is drawing interest from a number of viable potential candidates., \"These seats will be highly contested, thats no surprise,\" said Raphael Sonenshein, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute at Cal State L.A. and an expert on local politics. \"These are immensely powerful positions,\" he said., The races for the two seats dont get underway officially until March 7, the first day candidates can begin raising money for their campaigns, and the June 2016 primary is well over a year away, The 2002 voter-approved measure limiting supervisors to three four-year terms began taking effect with last years elections, opening seats that some supervisors had held for decades. The countys population has been growing ethnically diverse and its voters have become increasingly Democratic., Last year, former U.S. Labor Secretary Hilda Solis was elected to succeed the termed-out Gloria Molina, who won her seat in 1991, when the county was forced to redraw district lines after losing a lawsuit that held that the county had deprived Latino voters of an opportunity to elect a representative. Voters last year also picked former state legislator Sheila Kuehl to replace Zev Yaroslavsky, who left office due to term limits. The switch did not change the political makeup of the officially nonpartisan board  the newcomers replaced fellow Democrats  but some observers believe the new board members will be more labor-friendly than Yaroslavsky and Molina., In 2012 Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas, who is also a Democrat, won election to a second term with strong support from labor., Departing Supervisors Knabe and Antonovich, meanwhile, are Republicans who were rarely counted as labor allies., A shift to a female majority on a board that has seen only four women members in more than 160 years  and never more than two at one time  would stand in sharp contrast to the trend at other levels of state and local government. Across the state, the number of women in elected offices has mostly held steady or declined slightly., The possibility that voters could bring a female majority to a county board long dominated by men also represents the flip slide of what has happened at Los Angeles City Hall, where only one woman serves on the 15-member City Council. There once were five women on the council, beginning in 1997: Laura Chick, Ruth Galanter, Rita Walters, Cindy Miscikowski and Jackie Goldberg. A decade earlier, women held the councils leadership posts, with Pat Russell serving as president and Joan Milke Flores as president pro tem., Hahn, a former council member and an experienced politician with several tough elections under her belt, has a well-known name  her father served on the county Board of Supervisors for 40 years and her brother was Los Angeles city controller, city attorney and mayor. She is a proven fundraiser and has been racking up endorsements from elected officials  including Kuehl  and labor groups, including the Los Angeles County Professional Peace Officers Assn., But two Republicans also have jumped into the race. Steve Napolitano, a former Manhattan Beach councilman and a senior deputy in Knabes South Bay field office, has been running since the fall and has endorsements from a long list of local elected officials. (Knabe has not yet said whether he will endorse in the race.) Also running is Mike Gin, a former Redondo Beach school board member, city councilman and mayor who says he has experience balancing municipal budgets and making other tough decisions., Several others are taking a close look at Antonovichs seat, which some observers believe is likely to stay in Republican hands. Deputy Dist. Atty. Elan S. Carr, a moderate Republican who ran last year to succeed retiring Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Beverly Hills), said through a spokesman that a recent surge in crime has him considering a run for supervisor. The congressional race demonstrated that he can raise money, but he would need to move into the district from his home on the Westside., Other possible contenders are Lancaster Mayor R. Rex Parris, who said he would think about running if no suitable candidate emerges; Los Angeles City Councilman Mitch Englander, who has not ruled out making the race, and state Sen. Bob Huff (R-Diamond Bar), who is termed out in 2016.

{"Content": "[[, There was a man missing from Jeb Bushs foreign policy speech Tuesday night at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library -- the man who started the war in Iraq that Bush essentially blamed on those who inherited it, namely President Obama and his first secretary of State, Hillary Rodham Clinton., The missing man was Jeb Bushs older brother, former President George W. Bush, whose role went unspoken., Jeb Bush castigated Obama and Clinton for their handling of Iraq, and specifically for getting American troops out -- a move that was as wildly popular at the time as George W. Bushs war was unpopular., The difficulty in ignoring history means you end up with logic like this:, \"Who can seriously argue that America and our friends are safer today than in 2009, when the President and Secretary Clinton -- the storied team of rivals -- took office?\" Bush asked. \"So eager to be the history-makers, they failed to be the peacemakers. It was a case of blind haste to get out, and to call the tragic consequences somebody elses problem. Rushing away from danger can be every bit as unwise as rushing into danger, and the costs have been grievous.\", TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, And if it appeared that Bush was going to detail who rushed \"into danger,\" he did not. He simply said: \"All of that is in the past; it cannot be undone.\", He veered close to a discussion of his brothers role elsewhere in the speech -- or so it seemed for a moment., \"No leader or policymaker involved will claim to have gotten everything right in the region, Iraq especially,\" he said. Then, too, the subject could have turned to George W. Bush and how this Bush might differ from the last. But there would be no discussion of how the war began, or why; Bush skipped to criticizing Obamas decision to pull Americans out of Iraq after a surge of troops sought to take control of the country. He described the \"premature withdrawal\" -- not the decision to wage war -- as \"the fatal error.\", He suggested a wholesale assault on Iraq and Syria to curb what he described as a \"pandemic\" spread of radicalism that has drawn recruits from around the world. Included in his proposals was the overthrow of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, but Bush warned: \"We have to make sure that his regime is not replaced by something as bad or worse. The last thing we need in Syria is a repeat of Libya, with its planless aftermath, where the end of a dictatorship was only the beginning of more terrorist violence, including the death of four Americans in Benghazi.\", Unmentioned were the implications of knocking off the strongman who led Iraq, whose absence -- along with the absence of the Iraqi army, dispersed by the Bush administration -- contributed to the rise of the terrorists Jeb Bush deplored., The notable omissions in a speech meant to stake out his approach to world issues spoke to a difficulty at the heart of Jeb Bushs campaign: He cant really mention the role of his brother, whose foreign policy moves remain unpopular even as he has benefited, as all presidents do, from a certain post-presidency boost in popularity. And to dump on him would seem disloyal. But when George Bush goes missing, it only seems to highlight the past in bright neon and beg for some accounting of how the future under Jeb would be better., Both he and Clinton are burdened, to some extent, by family connections as they seek the White House. But while Clintons political skills pale in comparison to her husband Bills, she has an edge: Bill Clinton left the country under an ethical stain but with a booming economy. George Bush left under criticism for an unpopular war, and with a cratering economy., The latest Bush on the stage seemed to suggest that America as a whole is leaning in the direction of George W. Bushs foreign policy, but that appears to be an iffy proposition. Americans overall remain concerned about threats from Islamic terrorists but worried about greater U.S. involvement overseas, especially those that require in-country forces.The coffins returning home are not a distant memory., Some polling suggests that Bushs real audience is members of his own party, more than anyone else. Pew surveys in 2013 and 2014 found a huge surge in the percentage of Republicans who felt the U.S. exerted little authority overseas. Among Democrats and independents, there was only about a third of the hawkish movement found among Republicans., On Tuesday, Bush seemed to acknowledge American reluctance to become more assertive, as he invoked the spirit of Ronald Reagan in suggesting that America would get over it., \"Weariness with conflict ran pretty deep back then, along with despair of ever getting past it,\" he said in a passage that, curiously, credited Reagan with the fall of the Berlin Wall, which came down during his fathers presidency. \"But then along came one formidable figure, who would not accept that way of thinking, and he was the one who mattered the most.\", Bushs father -- who presided over the far more popular invasion of Iraq in 1991, during which he left Saddam Hussein in control in part to maintain stability in the region -- was, like George W. Bush, an unspoken presence in Jeb Bushs speech, and a familial complication of a different sort., George H.W. Bush famously commanded his Iraq war in the template of allied cooperation that had marked past world wars. He worked with foreign leaders to craft a near-unanimous assault against Iraq; the international accord went a long way toward assuaging political criticism at home. It was a far more collegial approach, with little of the my-way-or-the-highway feel of George W. Bushs. But on Tuesday night, the formidable alliances forged by his father were cast aside., \"Were not part of the community of nations,\" Jeb Bush said. \"We cant lead from behind.

{"Content": "[[, Theres a moment in season eight of the HBO comedy \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" when the character Larry David (played in duly neurotic and cantankerous fashion by the real Larry David) discovers the transformative power of eyeglasses. When his friend Leon, an African American with a penchant for baggy pants and gold chains, is barred from an event being held in a snooty hotel, Larry suggests that white acceptance might be simply a matter of the right accessory., \"Ive noticed that white people revere black people in glasses, go out of their way to do stuff with them,\" Larry tells Leon. \"A black man with glasses goes out for a job against a white man, glasses get the job. No glasses, no job.\", Sure enough, Leon puts on a pair of smart-looking specs and, even though the event is sold out and Larry himself is turned away, hes immediately ushered in., \"This is better than anything the civil rights leaders have ever come up with!\" Larry exclaims., \"I have overcome,\" says Leon earnestly., Is Rick Perry trying to pull off a similar trick with his glasses? Ever since the former Texas governor announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination last week, theres been much talk about whether Perry 2.0 will be discernibly smarter than the candidate we saw back in 2011. His famous \"oops\" moment  when he announced during a debate that he would shut down three major government agencies but couldnt remember the third one  sealed his reputation as a something of a good-old-boy airhead., But today, wearing dark-rimmed, nerdy-cum-arty frames, Perry looks, if not exactly professorial, at least like he wouldnt stand out at a gallery opening., In fairness, the Jean Lafont glasses, which Perry says his wife picked out, may not be overtly part of his campaign strategy. For starters, hes been wearing them since 2013. Whats more, it seems likely that Anita Perry chose this style simply because its often remarkably flattering., Obviously this is subjective, but Ive long noticed that when even the plainest person puts on a pair of dark, rectangular frames, he or she looks at least 60% more attractive. For instance, actor Paul Giamatti, not known for having an especially traditional Hollywood look, can thank his eyewear for kicking him up several notches in the appearance department. Perry, who was already a reasonably good-looking man, could pass for an aging male model in his glasses (the kind of guy you see in print ads for geriatric vitamins or retirement investment funds). At least if he lost that giant Aggie ring., Perrys frame style has its own taxonomy. The domain is Buddy Holly; the kingdom, Elvis Costello; the phylum, Tina Fey and so on. Personally, though, I like to call them Ira Glasses. Not just because theyve always been integral to the signature look of the host of NPRs \"This American Life\" but because the style seemed to gain cultural traction in the late 1990s and early aughts. Thats when the programs edgy, alternative vibe went from being something that only cool people knew about to something that (much to the distress of the cool people) everyone was hip to., The glasses frames had a similar trajectory. Formerly available mostly at vintage stores or high-end urban boutiques, by 2001 they could be found at any LensCrafters. Sure, their sharp lines and dark color still qualified them as \"statement eyewear.\" Its just that the statement basically amounted to \"Im different in exactly the same way everyone else is.\", Though there might be some truth to the theory that Perrys choice of eyewear represents an attempt to look smarter  or at least less dumb  I suspect theres an even subtler form of messaging in play. By sporting Ira Glasses, Perry may also be trying make himself more palatable to moderates and young people., Thats because the glasses dont say \"I know perfectly well what three government agencies Id shut down\" as much as \"I may support gun rights and not gay rights but that doesnt mean Im afraid to skew a little metrosexual\" (theres another late 90s/early aughts term for you). They dont say \"Im smart\" as much as \"Im not a redneck.\", Which is all well and good.

{"Content": "[[, Theres no argument: Californias death penalty is shamefully inoperative. Its shameful that state politicians wont fix it. Wont even try., Taxpayers are dumping big money into a death row where, for years, no one has been executed. Rather, hundreds of murderers have been living out their lives in relative comfort compared with inmates who committed lesser crimes., Capital punishment in California is an illusion and should be either formally repealed or reformed so death sentences actually can be carried out., But Gov. Jerry Brown and the Democratic-dominated Legislature wont do either. And Republicans dont have the power., California voters had the opportunity to end the wasteful charade two years ago. They could have passed Proposition 34, which would have abolished the death penalty and substituted life in prison without the possibility of parole. But they didnt, rejecting the initiative by a narrow four percentage points., Brown, a lifelong opponent of capital punishment, didnt lift a finger or utter a peep until election day. \"Of course\" he voted for the initiative, he told reporters after leaving a voting booth. But if during the campaign the governor had showed any leadership  even interest  the measure might have passed. He didnt want to do anything that could hurt his efforts to sell voters on a tax increase., An Orange County federal judge performed a great public service recently by ruling that the interminable delays and uncertainties of Californias death penalty render it unconstitutional because of the 8th Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment., \"For all practical purposes,\" U.S. District Judge Cormac J. Carney wrote, \"a sentence of death in California is a sentence of life imprisonment with the remote possibility of death  a sentence no rational legislature or jury could ever impose.\", Right. But the California Legislature is not rational on this issue and, by its inaction, has imposed the irrational sentence., Carney, an appointee of President George W. Bush, continued:, \"In California, the execution of a death sentence is so infrequent, and the delays preceding it so extraordinary, that the death penalty is deprived of any deterrent or retributive effect it might once have had. Such an outcome is antithetical to any civilized notion of just punishment...., \"Under such a system, the death penalty is about as effective a deterrent to capital crime as the possibility of a lightning strike is to going outside in the rain.\", The judges decision overturned the death sentence of only one man: Ernest Dewayne Jones of Los Angeles, who raped and murdered his girlfriends mother in 1992. But it will have broad significance if upheld on appeal., These are the eye-opening numbers: More than 900 people have been sentenced to death since California reinstated capital punishment in 1978, but only 13 have been executed, none since 2006. The appeal process pokes along for 25 years, twice the national average., San Quentins death row keeps growing. At last count, there were 748 condemned killers, living in single-bunk cells with TVs and extensive yard privileges. They dont work. By far, their dominant cause of death is old age. Presently, 142 are over age 60; two in their 80s., Carney noted that the state would need to execute more than one a week for 14 years just to clear out the currently condemned., But, of course, California has no legal way of executing them. The states three-drug lethal cocktail was banned by courts in 2006. Brown has ordered prison officials to develop a one-drug injection. But given his anti-death penalty history, dont count on that ever emerging., Another federal jurist, 9th Circuit Chief Judge Alex Kozinski, recently called for employing firing squads. \"I personally think we should go to the guillotine, but shooting is probably the right way to go,\" he told Times reporter Maura Dolan. A firing squad would be \"messy but effective.\", Either would be fine with me, although a firing squad is more American., Thats right. As Ive written before, you wont read any arguments here about the death penalty being immoral, unfair or barbaric. These creeps  once proven guilty beyond a shadow of doubt  should be removed from our planet ASAP. Let the depraved killer turn to his God for redemption and mercy., The issue for me is not about the merits of capital punishment. Its about senselessly pouring money down a rathole and even coddling the worst of the worst. If were not going to execute these murderers, push them out into the general prison population with nasty cellmates and work duties., Three years ago, a study by U.S. 9th Circuit Judge Arthur L. Alarcon and Loyola Law School professor Paula M. Mitchell found that death row prisoners cost $184 million more per year than if they had been sentenced to life without parole., Until that time, they calculated, California had spent roughly $4 billion to administer capital punishment over the previous 33 years. That amounted to about $308 million per execution., The Legislature, on a simple majority vote, could place a death penalty repealer on the ballot. But it hasnt the courage to risk a backlash from capital punishment supporters. Neither has Brown., Or it could fix the system by shortening the appeals process and hiring more attorneys to serve the condemned. But Democrats wont do that either., A law enforcement-victims rights coalition hopes to sponsor a reform initiative in 2016., \"Opponents say the system cant be fixed,\" says Kent Scheidegger, legal director of the pro-death penalty Criminal Justice Legal Foundation. \"Well, weve never tried. Its not a case of cant. Its a case of wont.\", Fine.

{"Content": "[[, They could not be more different, but Chris Christie and Jerry Brown have found opposite paths to the elusive goal of political popularity., Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, has a long, public and largely unrequited love affair with Bruce Springsteen. Brown, the Democratic governor of California, has allowed that his favorite music is the Gregorian chant. (Or so he declared during his black turtleneck period, circa 1990s.), Christie physically dominates his surroundings, even in his lessened, post-bariatric-surgery state, insinuating that hed be happy to plow through any brick wall ahead of him if the need arose., Brown comes off as someone who would rather wisp through the mortar, avoiding the mess and jumble Christies approach leaves behind., PHOTOS: 2013s memorable political moments, Christie commands the television screens at home and nationally, as he did Thursday and Friday due to the conflagration on the Jersey shore boardwalk. He has become the mournful siren of a state with a perennial chip on its shoulder, exhorting his people to stand up, again, even if they are exhausted from the last time., Brown is a ghost, mostly invisible to tens of millions of Californians whose only connection would be via television, a medium he ignores regardless of its importance to other politicians. He is the personification of a state that takes pleasure in flouting the rules, knowing that playing by them wouldnt markedly improve its image among outsiders anyway., And it has worked for both of them., Browns popularity in California rivals President Obamas, and even Republicans give him great odds of winning reelection in 2014. Christie is running away with his reelection race, which concludes in November, and looking toward a possible presidential bid down the road., At the moment, their very different styles mesh with where their states are., Christies style wears well in crises, of which there have been an endless supply lately in New Jersey. There he was on Thursday night, near the flaming Seaside Park boardwalk, telling Jersey Shore residents that this is us  as soon as this is over well pick ourselves up, well dust ourselves off, and well get back to work., As for everyone else, he said firmly: Do not come here. Do not travel. Stay away. It was a muted version of his angry warning as Hurricane Irene aimed for the same coast in 2011: Get the hell off the beach!, Bombastic style can be what the populace wants in crises, when people relish being told what to do. But it can wear poorly over the long haul, which may be Christies challenge if he launches a bid for president. That has certainly been the case in California, where Arnold Schwarzeneggers similar approach got old fast., Brown, previously a two-term governor with mixed results, won in 2010 as voters were still recovering from the dramatic largesse of the Arnold years and were yearning for someone quieter who knew which buttons to push., It was not just a change of style that Brown promised, but something more profound for Californians  a state government back in control, a state that demonstrated that it was, after all, governable., Browns office reinforced that sentiment Friday when it touted a host of issues that he and the Legislature had plowed through this year: a balanced budget, healthcare reform, a minimum-wage hike, prison moves., It might have been the template for his reelection argument, not that anyone could hear Brown saying that., Twitter: @cathleendecker, cathleen.decker@latimes.com]", "Date": "20130913", "Title": "[Chris Christie, Jerry Brown: Clashing, successful political styles]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-chris-christie-jerry-brown-politics-20130913-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}

Sanders has drawn huge crowds across the country in recent days, with 28,000 people turning out to hear him speak at a rally in Portland, Ore., over the weekend., \"The reason were doing so well in this campaign is were telling the truth,\" Sanders told the L.A. crowd, which his campaign estimated at 27,500, both inside the arena and in an overflow area outside watching on giant television screens., \"This is an economy that is rigged and meant to benefit those on top,\" Sanders said in a raspy voice strained by several days of back-to-back campaign rallies. \"We need an economy that works for all people.\", Although Sanders message is resonating with liberals intrigued by an alternative to Clinton, many political analysts and even some of his supporters say his chances of winning the Democratic nomination are slim. Polls suggest that most of his supporters would back a Clinton candidacy if she becomes the nominee., Still, he has a passionate following among left-leaning voters for whom Clinton seems too moderate., \"Bernie Sanders is sticking his head out of the window and saying, Im mad as hell and Im not going to take it anymore.

Theyre not average voters, who are barely tuned in to the election at this point.\", Sanders, who has been interrupted several times at previous rallies by Black Lives Matter demonstrators calling on him to address police shootings, invited the group to open his rally in Los Angeles. \"There is no president that will fight harder to end institutional racism,\" he told the crowd., He also gave time to an immigrant rights activist, and pledged to bring the millions of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally \"out of the shadows.\", \"Eleven million people cannot continue to live in fear,\" Sanders said., The Vermont senator faces serious challenges in his long-shot bid for the presidency, including poor name recognition and low levels of support from minority voters., Nonwhite voters make up a third or more of Democratic primary voters in most states, according to exit polls. Sanders, who represents a state that is 94% white, has made few inroads in the Latino and African American communities., Clinton, on the other hand, has broad support among those groups. She did better among Latinos than Barack Obama in the 2008 primary, and a new Gallup poll shows she is viewed favorably by 80% of African Americans. Only 23% of blacks polled in that survey said they had favorable views of Sanders, with two-thirds saying they didnt know enough about Sanders to have an opinion., Marilynn Manderscheid is a retired elementary school teacher who drove from Orange County to hear Sanders speak Monday night.

{"Content": "[[, This isnt a glorious summer for Hillary Rodham Clinton., Shes running for president as hard as she can, rolling out wonky policy proposals, holding town meetings, even talking with reporters now and then., But her poll numbers are down, especially on whether shes trustworthy and honest. Surveys that once had her trouncing any Republican opponent (Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, for example) show the gap has narrowed., Her policy speeches on Wall Street regulation and climate change got mixed reviews, even among Democrats. Progressives are particularly unhappy that shes dodging the issues they care about: the proposed trade agreement with Asia and the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Clinton is neither for nor against, an awkward position for a candidate who needs a shot of trustworthiness. (Bernie Sanders, whose positions arent so hedged, is drawing ecstatic liberal crowds.), As if that werent enough, shes still got that email problem. The U.S. intelligence communitys inspector general found that, contrary to her claim, Clintons private emails did contain classified information, although the material apparently wasnt marked as secret. He has asked the Justice Department to investigate whether security regulations were broken., Its enough to make any campaign a little edgy. Some of her people are nervous, sure, a Democratic strategist with ties to the Clinton camp told me. But campaign people are always nervous., These setbacks wont block Clintons march to the Democratic nomination. She still commands a daunting margin of about 40% over Sanders in national polls. Polls are closer in Iowa and New Hampshire, where the first votes will be cast, but not close enough to make it a real contest yet., Rather, these glitches point to vulnerabilities for Clinton in a general election campaign. While voters views of her are predictably polarized by party affiliation, she faces skepticism among independents., A CNN poll last month, for example, found that 81% of Democrats said they had a favorable view of Clinton  and 82% of Republicans had an unfavorable view. Among independents, though, the balance was negative: 47% unfavorable, 37% favorable., Likewise, an earlier CNN poll that found 57% of voters did not consider Clinton to be honest, including 87% of Republicans  and 61% of independents. Can Clinton fix that kind of trust problem after more than 25 years in the public eye?, Not simply by talking about it, as became clear when she told CNN, People should and do trust me. There wasnt much else she could say, but her assertion of honesty was painfully awkward., Her campaigns response has been: Lets change the subject., Thats the wrong question to focus on, Clinton aide Jennifer Palmieri told me. The real question is: Do you believe shes going to fight for you? Her whole campaign is focused on proving that, and we do well on that question., So instead of focusing on bolstering her own trustworthiness, Clinton is working to shore up support among those who deeply distrust Republicans with their interests: unmarried women, African Americans and Latinos. Shes been emphasizing womens issues and playing up her new status as a grandmother  a big change from her campaign in 2008. And at the National Urban League last week, she came out swinging, telling her mostly African American audience: You cannot seriously talk about the right to rise  Bushs campaign slogan  and support laws that deny the right to vote., Still Clintons trust problem wont go away. The email controversy, set in motion by her decision to use a personal server when she was secretary of State, ensures that. In addition to the latest Justice Department investigation, the State Department has been ordered to continue to release copies of Clintons emails as they are declassified, month by month  meaning voters will be reminded of the issue over and over., Palmieri repeated the campaigns contention that the candidate did nothing wrong and pointed out that Clinton has weathered scandals before. Shes not Teflon, but shes cast iron, the aide said., Besides, as political analyst Charlie Cook recently pointed out, the trust question isnt always decisive. In 1992, the Democratic nominee won despite the fact that most voters didnt find him particularly honest.

{"Content": "[[, This spring, Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush had difficulty answering a question about how he viewed the invasion of Iraq that defined  and ultimately consumed  his brothers presidency., On Tuesday, however, Bush plunged directly into the wars political wake., In what his campaign billed as a major speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Bush highlighted the continued instability in Iraq and its neighbor, Syria, as a central focus of his foreign policy. He vowed to use military force more aggressively than President Obama has done and blamed the administration  and its former secretary of State, Hillary Rodham Clinton  for the rise of the Islamic State militant group, also known as ISIS., It is not true, and was wishful thinking by the administration to claim, that the tide of war is receding, Bush said., Radical Islam has been spreading like a pandemic, he said, vowing to be resolute  in the defeat of radical Islamic terrorism wherever it appears., Bush called for a no-fly zone over parts of Syria, expanded safe zones for the persecuted within Syria, and embedding some U.S. ground forces with Iraqi units  all significant steps the administration has opposed.He said that while a major commitment of American ground forces was not necessary, the nation may need to expand the number of soldiers and Marines in Iraq. He also called for providing Iraqi forces with American air support., In proposing more aggressive American involvement in the region, Bush addressed the concerns of many Republican voters who have told pollsters and interviewers that they see Obama as weak and believe foreign policy  and specifically the threat of militant Islam  is a key issue for the next election., But the approach, particularly the emphasis on the military, carries considerable risk for Bush, heir to a name that is closely connected in the minds of many voters with a deeply unpopular war. After Bushs campaign had released excerpts ahead of the speech, Clintons campaign went on the attack Tuesday morning, suggesting that Bushs policies would once again lead to U.S. combat forces on the ground in a Mideast war., On Tuesday night, before a crowd of 1,000 in Simi Valley, Bush said Obama and Clintons foreign policy was based on grandiose talk and little action. Clintons record  including a failed attempt to reset relations with Russia and the death of four Americans in attacks on U.S. compoundsin Benghazi, Libya  is one of failure, he said., Bush spent the bulk of his 30-minute speech layingout an account of the Iraq wars aftermath in which Islamic State grew because of what he called Obamas hasty troop withdrawal from Iraq and overall American abandonmentof the region., That premature withdrawal was the fatal error, creating the void that ISIS moved in to fill  and that Iran has exploited to the full as well, Bush said., And where was  Secretary of State Clinton in all of this? he asked., In all of her record-setting travels, she stopped by Iraq exactly once, said Bush, 62, the former governor of Florida. Who can seriously argue that America and our friends are safer today than in 2009, when the president and Secretary Clinton  the storied team of rivals  took office?, Clintons campaign accused him of trying to rewrite history in his effort to blame the rise of Islamic State on the Obama administration. Republicans cannot be allowed to escape responsibility for the problems caused by former President George W. Bushs invasion of Iraq, said Jake Sullivan, the campaigns senior policy advisor, to reporters on a conference call., Islamic State emerged in no small part as a result of President Bushs failed strategy, said Sullivan, who served as a top aide to Clinton when she was secretary of State. He pointed to the Bush administrations decision in the early days of the U.S. occupation to disband the Iraqi army, which left many military personnel, mostly Sunnis, unemployed, embittered and armed., Its curious that Gov. Bush is choosing Iraq as the place he wants to engage the foreign policy debate, Sullivan said., In June, Jeb Bush ventured on a five-day European tour in which he called for the restoration of Americas leadership in world affairs and argued that the Obama administrations approach had emboldened enemies and weakened allies. Its a theme Bush highlightedduring his speech., The threat of global jihad, and of the Islamic State in particular, requires all the strength, unity and confidence that only American leadership can provide, Bush said Tuesday night., He focused on the wars end, which occurred under Obama, rather than on the wars beginning., So why was the success of the surge followed by a withdrawal from Iraq, leaving not even the residual force that commanders and the joint chiefs knew was necessary?  Like the president himself, [Clinton] had opposed the surge, then joined in claiming credit for its success, then stood by as that hard-won victory by American and allied forces was thrown away, Bush said., Bushs jibe that Clinton had only traveled to Iraq once during her tenure at the State Department poses a more difficult problem for the former secretary of States campaign. During Obamas first term, it was Vice President Joe Biden, not Clinton, who played the lead role in executing U.S. policy toward Iraq., The key issue is not how many times the plane touches down at the airport, Sullivan said; its how effective an official is. Clinton, he said, had played an important role in Iraqs transition from U.S. occupation to civilian rule., Bush did not call for significantly increasing the number of ground troops in Iraq, which someof his GOP rivals, most notably Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have called for., Polls show that a significant majority of Republican voters support the idea of U.S. troops returning to the Mideast. The concept is very unpopular among Democrats., In a poll last month, for example, the nonpartisan Pew Research Center found that self-identified Republicans by a 2-1 margin supported sending U.S. ground troops to fight Islamic State. Democrats opposed the idea by the same margin.

{"Content": "[[, This week brought something familiar in the long-running investigation of the closure of roads leading to the George Washington Bridge by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christies advisors: more information but little additional clarity about who developed and directed four days of traffic tie-ups., Christies chief of staff, Kevin ODowd, says that as the bridge controversy heated up last year, the governor told him to ask one of ODowds deputies whether she knew anything about the scheme., Absolutely not, Bridget Kelly replied. ODowd said he saw no reason to doubt her  even though there were already allegations that someone in his office had signed off on the closure of Fort Lee, N.J., bridge access roads., I never conducted my own investigation to figure out what went on here, ODowd said during a marathon hearing Monday before the state legislative panel investigating the traffic scheme. I just didnt engage in it., Kelly sent an email just before the closures that read, \"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\", The leaders of the panel had high hopes for the testimony of ODowd, the highest-ranking Christie administration official to appear so far. But seven hours of questions failed to produce much of a reaction from the imperturbable former federal prosecutor, let alone any new information that would explain the bizarre plot to choke off traffic leading to the bridge for four days last September., ODowd, like other witnesses, said he knew nothing of the scheme before it happened  and didnt ask many questions about it afterward., William Pat Schuber, one of Christies appointees on the authority that operates the bridge, testified recently that he didnt either. I saw this very quickly becoming a political football, and I just didnt want to be involved in it, said Schuber, who professed a lack of memory about many of the details., The investigations are expected to extend for months and still pose a threat to any ambitions Christie has to run for president in 2016. Butwith polls showing that even New Jersey voters are paying less attention to the scandal, Christie has stepped up his national appearances, trying to regain momentum as he raises money for fellow Republicans around the country. He is scheduled to appear on NBCs \"Tonight Show\" on Thursday., Democrats on the committee have been sharp in pointing out what state Sen. Loretta Weinberg, the co-chair, has called a curious lack of curiosity. But with progress slowing, and even some Democrats grumbling about pulling the plug, the leaders of the investigation have been forced on the defensive., Its not the time to take the exit ramp. This is the time to keep plowing forward, Assemblyman John Wisniewski, the other co-chair, said in an op-ed in the Record newspaper., So far, just two people have been linked to the bridge plan: Kelly and her friend David Wildstein, the Christie appointee to the Port Authority who has insisted, at least in public, that he was conducting a traffic study. But that story took a beating after emails surfaced showing the two chortling over the chance to create headaches for the mayor of Fort Lee, the town on the New Jersey side of the bridge, who didnt endorse Christies reelection., Kelly and Wildstein arent talking, especially not with federal prosecutors conducting their own investigation. And the committee has had to put off its questions for the executive director of the Port Authority, Patrick J. Foye, at the request of federal prosecutors. The hearings are taking a hiatus until the state passes a budget this summer., In his rush to leave the controversy behind, Christie could find some encouragement in a recent poll that found his approval ratings in New Jersey have stabilized at about 44%  a steep drop from the pre-bridge levels but a fairly typical number for second-term governors, said Krista Jenkins, a political science professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University who conducted the poll., But she said the survey also found that Christie had lost a lot of support among independents and Democrats, weakening his claim as a candidate who could tempt voters to cross party lines., As for the bridge story, Jenkins said the poll showed voters might be ready to move on. Just 22% of the states voters say theyre still paying close attention. But she said that would quickly change if the investigations produced new revelations: 58% of voters still doubt Christies assertion that he didnt know about the lane closures  up 5 percentage points from January., Were sort of teetering right now because key witnesses arent willing to disclose anything, she said.

Jeb Bushs supportfor a pathway to legality for immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally., And they pledged to make their voices heard on election day in 2016 against a Republican-controlled Congress that has stymied immigration reform., We will be there at the ballot box next year to make sure they pay a price, said Juan Jose Gutierrez, who helped organize the original 2006 May Day immigration march., Many families were among the marchers. Fatima Rios, 23, came with her mother, sister and two young daughters. She said Obamas effortto defer deportation for parents of Americans and lawful permanent residents would help protect her mother, who entered the country without permission., Rios said her mother wants the opportunity to earn a living here legally. And, Rios said, I want my daughters to have their grandmother here., Families expressed deep concern about the threat of deportation. Flor Muoz, 18, who received temporary deportation relief as part of a programto defer legal action against immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children, said she is the only one in her family who is not at risk of being sent out of the country., I want to be able to see my dad not be scared anymore. He doesnt want to travel around because hes scared to get deported, said Muoz, of Compton., Consuelo Soto, 38, feared for herself and her husband, who are here illegally and have a 5-year-old son who was born in the U.S., while their other child, 16, was recently given protection from deportation., We dont know what will happen to our family, she said in Spanish. It is hard: emotionally, economically. We are here to work and be a part of this country., As the crowd thinned out, Silvia Sandoval, 56, said she was disheartened by the turnout., If people protest, and they dont see the results they want, they get discouraged, she said in Spanish.

{"Content": "[[, Thousands of bills get introduced each legislative session, and most are sops to special interests or simply silly. But here are three no-brainers that should be passed., Theyre not Earth-shattering, just sensible., Not everyone will agree, naturally., Two are offered by Republicans, so dominant Democrats will be inclined to ignore them. The third is a proposed election change by a Democrat, so Republicans instinctively will be suspicious., The first is a gun-control bill, but not the ordinary sort., It would correct an ugly flaw in a ballot initiative passed overwhelmingly by voters in November., Proposition 47 was sold as a proposal to eliminate prison sentences for non-serious crimes. It reduced from a possible felony to always a misdemeanor the possession of narcotics and the theft of property valued under $950. No prison time. Probably a wrist-slap., Surely it was botched drafting, but that means stealing a gun worth less than $950, which practically all are, is a misdemeanor. So is knowingly possessing or selling such a stolen firearm., California has the nations toughest gun controls for citizens  and good for us  but were telling criminals its not a big deal to steal a weapon., \"People are not stealing guns to go duck hunting,\" says Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez (R-Lake Elsinore). \"Theyre stealing them to commit crime.\", Melendezs bill, AB 150, would restore the old penalties for gun thefts. Stealing one of any value would be a felony. Possessing a stolen firearm could be a felony or a misdemeanor, whats known as a \"wobbler.\", The bill would need to go on the ballot if passed by the Legislature and signed by the governor., \"Were empowering criminals to commit more crime,\" asserts Melendez, a retired Navy intelligence eavesdropper on the Russians during the Cold War., Its still a felony to burglarize a house and grab anything. But there are other places to heist a gun relatively penalty-free, including stores., \"Catch a guy on the street with a firearm and I cant prove he broke into a house, but I can prove from serial numbers that it was stolen,\" says San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon. \"If we cant put a person in jail for stealing a gun, were really missing the mark.\", The second bill gets into the battle of the bags., Several California cities  including Los Angeles and San Francisco  have banned single-use plastic bags at groceries and pharmacies. The Legislature last year extended that ban statewide., Fine. Get rid of them. Repeat: Its OK, at least for me. Just keep my newspapers wrapped in plastic on rainy days. But we wont get into that hypocrisy., My gripe is that big nanny Sacramento also ordered stores  and most of them love it  to charge at least 10 cents for each paper bag that used to be handed out free. OK, it was always built into the grocery price. But that was the stores decision, not the Legislatures. Now grocers can conveniently tell the consumer, \"Sacramento made me.\", And the money  were talking an estimated $600 million a year  doesnt go into environmental cleanup. It goes directly into the merchants pockets., Anyway, paper bags are environmentally friendly. They are biodegradable. Ocean creatures dont gag on them as they do plastic. In California, trees arent chopped down to make paper bags. Sawmill chips are swept up and combined with recycled paper., Defenders of the fee argue that without it, more consumers would use paper bags and not purchase sturdier reusable bags  usually composed of some petroleum-based material and water-guzzling cotton. So wheres the environmental benefit there?, Anyway, whats next? State government setting the price for paper towels? Toilet paper?, \"If retailers want to charge for bags, thats not a matter for heavy-handed government to decide for them,\" says Republican Assemblyman Matthew Harper, a former mayor of Huntington Beach, which recently repealed its plastic bag ban., Harpers bill, SB 190, would scrub just the paper bag fee., The plastic bag industry, however, is sponsoring a referendum to repeal the entire ban. That proposal appears headed for the November 2016 ballot. Meanwhile, the ban will be on hold., But the Legislature still could repeal the paper fee and get out of the business of price-setting for the private sector., The third no-brainer bill would make it easier to vote by requiring that every registered voter be mailed an absentee ballot. Now youve got to request one or be listed as a permanent absentee voter., OK, but how much would that cost?, Less, says Sen. Bob Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys), author of the bill, SB 163. \"Think about it.\", He would save money by combining the current sample ballot  already sent to everyone  with an absentee ballot. Just include a return envelope for the filled-out ballot. Eliminate the second mailing of a ballot to absentee voters. Anyone who wanted to vote at a polling place still could., Absentee voting has been rising rapidly in California. In 1962, fewer than 3% voted by mail. In 1982, only 6.5% did; 2002, 27%., Last November, 60.5% voted absentee. Who were they? They were fairly reflective of the states political makeup, according to Paul Mitchell, vice president of Political Data Inc., Hertzbergs bill, Mitchell says, \"is probably the most impactful election-law change you could do to increase voter turnout.\", It would make it easier to throw out legislators who dont support common-sense bills., twitter: @LATimesSkelton]", "Date": "20150208", "Title": "[Three common-sense bills worth supporting]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-cap-bills-20150209-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, Three potential Republican presidential contenders parried on issues including Cuba policy and the qualities necessary to win the White House during a Sunday night panel discussion that also afforded an unprecedented, if limited, peek into the workings of influential band of conservative donors., Freedom Partners, part of the web of political organizations financed by Charles and David Koch and other wealthy donors, broke with its tradition of privacy to allow a live stream of a debate of sorts among Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky. It was held at a resort in Palm Springs after days of closed meetings., The result was a detailed discussion of issues that at this early stage of the campaign have largely been explored only in broad brushstrokes. And it illustrated differences that will be discussed at length in the Republican primaries should the three men -- currently all exploring the 2016 race -- jump in., Stark disagreement came in the area of Cuban policy, with Paul supporting President Obamas recent overtures to ease tensions with the island, and Rubio and Cruz -- both of whom have familial ties to Cuba -- emphatically disagreeing., Weve tried an embargo for 50 years; it hasnt worked, said Paul, who added that he thought trade actually would benefit the people of Cuba., There isnt a single contemporary example of that happening, Rubio replied. He cited the opening of U.S. relations with China and its continued human rights violations., China today is a more prosperous country but it is not a free country, the Florida senator said. What it is is the richest tyranny in all of human history., Paul replied that there are more than two dozen Muslim nations that punish Christians, and that applying Rubios standard would mean not trading with them., Im not a real big fan of a lot of these regimes, but I guess I dont want to isolate ourselves and say we are not going to trade with people who arent perfect Western-type democracies, he said., Cruz called the Obama administrations Cuba move a terrible mistake that would extend communist power there., This will result in billions of dollars more for the Castro regime, he said., A similar schism arose over the Western sanctions against Iran, with Paul concerned about pursuing diplomatic options and Cruz arguing that a harsh hand would reap benefits. The language employed by the Texas senator was the furthest from diplomatic, as he contrasted what he said were better chances that the U.S. could bend North Korea to its will than Iran., In North Korea, both father and son [referring to leader Kim Jong Un and his father and predecessor, the late Kim Jong Il] are fundamentally megalomaniacal narcissists, he said, which means some degree of rational deterrence is possible. ... The problem with Iran is [its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei and the mullahs are radical religious Islamic nutcases. And thats the technical term. When you have religious leaders who glorify death and suicide, ordinary cost/benefit doesnt work., One area of complete agreement was the role of the sort of wealthy donors who invited the senators to the Palm Springs retreat. Asked by the moderator, ABC news correspondent Jon Karl, whether the super-wealthy political donors had too much influence, Rubio replied mockingly., As opposed to Hollywood or the mainstream media, you mean, or other multibillion-dollar entities that try to influence American politics every day? he asked, drawing cheers from the audience. He defended the rights of all donors -- left or right -- to engage in political financing., I believe in freedom of speech and I believe spending money on political campaigns is a form of political speech that is protected under the Constitution, and the people who seem to have a problem with it are the ones who only want unions to be able to do it, their friends in Hollywood to be able to do it and their friends in the media to be able to do it., Cruz said that Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid had embarked on a campaign against the Koch brothers because they cannot defend the Obama economy which is a disaster. ... They want to scare people., I think that is grotesque and offensive, he said., The Palm Springs event came on a busy weekend in a presidential contest that, without a single declared candidate, is roaring to life 22 months before the election. On Friday, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush spoke in San Francisco. On Saturday, more than a half dozen potential candidates took part in a speech-making marathon in Des Moines. Cruz was the only candidate to appear in Iowa, site of the first 2016 voting, and Palm Springs., Karl also asked the three about the recent pronouncement by 2012 nominee Mitt Romney that he was considering a 2016 run, with a new focus on poverty and related issues. None of the three openly embraced his return., Mitt Romney, I think, is an extraordinary person, said Rubio, one of those Romney considered as his running mate before selecting Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. Hes someone whos earned the right to decide what it is he wants to do., But Paul indicated far greater reservations., Im kind of with Ann Romney on this one, he joked, referring to past opposition by Romneys wife to another race. No no no no never., He called Romney a good man, a generous man but one whose attraction was limited., To win the presidency, you have to reach out and appeal to new constituencies and I just dont think its possible, he said, and if he thinks, Well just change a few themes and reach out to people, ... I think its a little more visceral than that -- how you connect with people ... I just dont think that visceral connection is there with enough people to win a general election., As to who should be the next nominee, the senators unsurprisingly pushed back against the notion forwarded by some Republican governors that the GOP would be better off with a state leader than one tied to Washington., Once again it was Rubio who most forcefully made the case, arguing that the next president had to be well versed in the multiple facets challenging the nation., It is important for the next president of the United States to understand the diversity of these challenges, to have a global strategic vision and an understanding of what the U.S. role is, he said. Does that mean a governor cant acquire that? Of course they could. But Id also say that taking a trip to a foreign city for two days does not make you Henry Kissinger either. Youve got to spend some time on those issues., But Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who seems aimed at a presidential run, made a strong case for a governor on the ticket, ABCs Karl said., If I was a governor, Rubio replied, Id say the same thing., For political news and analysis, follow me on Twitter: @cathleendecker]", "Date": "20150126", "Title": "[GOP senators, and possible 2016 rivals, vie at Koch brothers retreat]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-koch-brothers-retreat-senators-20150126-story.html", "Author": "[Cathleen Decker]"}
{"Content": "[[, Throughout American history, Congress has often been at odds with the president. But so far, the legislative body has not turned to the third government branch  the judiciary  with a lawsuit claiming the chief executive violated the Constitution., That may change as House Republicans say they intend to sue President Obama for failing to \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed,\" as the Constitution requires., As evidence, the GOP will point to Obamas decision to delay enforcement of a provision of his signature healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act, which requires large employers to offer health insurance. According to the law passed by Congress, the mandate was to take effect \"beginning after December 31, 2013.\" But amid problems with the rollout, Obama delayed it until Jan. 1, 2015., Although House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) opposes the \"employer mandate,\" he says the lawsuit  which would demand more stringent enforcement of the law he wants to overturn  is about \"protecting the Constitution.\" Democrats, not surprisingly, deride it as a political stunt., Politics aside, legal experts see four reasons a lawsuit is likely to fail:, Lack of standing, The Supreme Court has made it clear in recent decades that members of Congress have no standing to file constitutional lawsuits. The justices have insisted plaintiffs must show they suffered a \"personal injury\" and are not merely in court to argue an abstract point of law. They are often loath to be drawn into political battles better left to the legislative branch and president., In the 1970s, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) sued Republican President Nixon over his use of the \"pocket veto,\" and Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) sued President Carter, a Democrat, for dropping a defense treaty with Taiwan. Kennedy won in lower courts, but others failed upon reaching the high court. In the 1997 case of Raines vs. Byrd, the Supreme Court ruled broadly that lawmakers do not have standing to sue in their capacity as members of Congress., Just last year, the high court expounded on its views about lack of standing when it dismissed the defense of Californias Proposition 8. Sponsors of the ballot measure, which banned gay marriage, appealed after a federal judge invalidated the law and state officials refused to defend it. But the justices rejected the sponsors appeal., \"To have standing, a litigant must seek relief for an injury that affects him in a personal and individual way,\" said Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. \"This is an essential limit on our power: It ensures that we act as judges, and do not engage in policymaking properly left to elected representatives.\", Cornell Law professor Michael Dorf said the high courts insistence on personal standing means the House Republicans \"face an insuperable obstacle\" in getting their case before a judge., But Washington attorney David B. Rivkin, who helped launch the suit that challenged Obamas healthcare law as unconstitutional, dismissed the skeptics. Though the high court ruled individual lawmakers cannot sue, Rivkin and Elizabeth Price Foley, a law professor at Florida International University, predict the justices will allow the House to sue as a law-making body., Presidents are given leeway to enforce laws, Obamas supporters point out that he is not the first president to postpone enforcement of a law or to miss a deadline to issue new rules. Democratic lawyers note that the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations decided to phase in congressionally mandated changes to Medicare in the last 15 years. Most recently, Bushs health advisors delayed for a year enforcing a late-enrollment penalty for new prescription drug coverage., Simon Lazarus, a lawyer for the Constitutional Accountability Center, told a House committee recently that there was \"no material difference between these decisions by the Clinton and Bush administrations to postpone regulations and the Obama administrations approach to implementing\" the Affordable Care Act. This is \"not a refusal to enforce the law, but a phase-in, and thats different,\" he said., Moreover, lawyers say it is routine for agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, to miss deadlines or order delays in issuing new rules established by Congress., Constitutional experts say it has been understood that the chief executive has some discretion in enforcing the law, just as police officers have discretion not to write a ticket for every driver who exceeds the posted speed limit., \"Courts are very reluctant to tell the executive how to enforce the law,\" said Tara Leigh Grove, a law professor at William & Mary Law School. \"We dont have a history of the House or Senate suing the president. And it would be very hard for a court to say a one-year delay means the president is refusing to enforce the law.\", Lazarus predicts judges \"will see this as a political maneuver,\" because it will be \"apparent to all that faithful execution of the Affordable Care Act is the last thing in the world that the proponents of the suit hope for.\", No easy legal remedy, Typically, a plaintiff sues and asks for compensation for his loss. In a constitutional suit, the proposed remedy may be a ruling that strikes down a law., But it is not clear what a judge could order as a remedy if he or she decided the president had wrongly delayed enforcement of the employer mandate., And the time for a decision is short. The insurance mandate for large employers is due to take effect in 2015, while the mandate for employers with 50 to 100 employees is due to take effect at the start of 2016. If the suit is still pending, it could be declared moot then., Impeachment the proper forum, While the Constitution does not authorize the legislative branch to sue the president, it says the House of Representatives may vote on articles of impeachment if it believes the president has committed \"high crimes and misdemeanors.\" If Republicans believe Obama has broken the law, impeachment is the appropriate vehicle, analysts say., But this process requires far more evidence of wrongdoing than a delayed phase-in of a new law. And impeachment can carry a high political cost. When House Republicans voted to impeach President Clinton in 1998, his popularity rose. Republicans lost seats in the fall election, and Speaker Newt Gingrich resigned., Last year, three of the Supreme Courts leading conservatives warned House Republicans against running to court. Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas, supported the Defense of Marriage Act, which banned federal recognition of same-sex marriages. Nonetheless, they said House Republicans did not have standing in their attempt to defend the law., This matter should have \"been left to a tug-of-war between the president and Congress, which has innumerable means (up to and including impeachment) of compelling the president to enforce the laws it has written,\" Scalia wrote., Allowing lawmakers to sue, he warned, would unwisely create a whole new \"system in which Congress and the executive can pop immediately into court, in their institutional capacity, whenever the president refuses to implement a statute he believes to be unconstitutional, and whenever he implements a law in a manner that is not to Congress liking.\", david.savage@latimes.com]", "Date": "20140719", "Title": "[Why experts see little hope for GOP plan to sue Obama over law's delay]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-house-lawsuit-20140720-story.html", "Author": "[David G.

{"Content": "[[, To a cheering crowd, Republican presidential contender Donald Trump continued to rail against illegal immigration Saturday, pointedly criticizing the Mexican government and pledging to build a fence along the U.S.-Mexico border, while also taking stabs other Republican presidential contenders, Democrats and the media., Mexico -- I respect the country, Trump said in Phoenix. Theyre taking our jobs, theyre taking our manufacturing, theyre taking our money, theyre taking everything, and theyre killing us at the border., Trump, who recently called Mexican immigrants rapists and drug dealers, acknowledged: The Mexican government is not happy with me, to put it mildly., As he has repeatedly since the making the comments forcefully criticized by members of his own party, Trump said he respected Mexico and the Mexican people. But their leaders are too smart for our leaders, because we have stupid leaders, OK? he said, to cheers and chants of U-S-A!, He added, Dont worry, well take our country back. Very soon., His pledge to erect a wall along the entire southern border prompted shouts of, Build the wall!, Trumps unapologetic and at times perplexing campaign (he says he can win the Latino vote) has thrust the issue of immigration to the forefront of the 2016 campaign. Saturdays event in Phoenix was originally scheduled to be held at a nearby hotel, but, according to local Republican officials, demand soared in recent days, prompting the move to the larger venue. Also appearing was Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a firebrand on the issue., Jim Wines and his sister-in-law waited in 100-degree heat outside the convention center Saturday morning to see Trump., He calls a spade a spade and is the only one willing to say it like it is, said Wines, a registered Republican and ardent Arpaio supporter from Surprise, Ariz., Id vote for him to be president today, he said of Trump., Standing a few feet behind Wines in a line that stretched nearly a city block stood Diane Sapiro, who wore a Trump button that read Make America great again. Sapiro said shes an unaffiliated voter, disenchanted by both Democrats and Republicans., Hes arrogant and a little cocky, but when he talks, hes saying stuff I agree with, said the Chandler, Ariz., resident. Illegals coming across the border are an issue here. Were a border state and its a real issue., Trump didnt limit his talk to immigration. At various points he took on President Obama (You know I dont use teleprompters like the president; I speak from the heart), Caroline Kennedy, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Jeb Bush, NBC and Macys., Who would you rather have negotiating a really good deal with China, Mexico, Japan. Trump or Jeb Bush? he asked., Earlier Saturday, Trump spoke at FreedomFest, a libertarian-oriented event in Las Vegas. Again, Mexico was a target., You remember the old days with Castro, when he emptied his jails and sent them to the United States? he asked. Well, Mexico does similar things., For a few unscripted minutes, Trump strayed from his prepared remarks and invited Jamiel Shaw Sr. to the podium to relate the story of his son, who was fatally shot in 2008 in South Los Angeles by an immigrant in the country illegally., I see him almost like a dad, Shaw said of Trump. Hes the kind of man that you would want to be your dad., Toward the end of the Las Vegas speech, Trump took questions from the audience. One attendee from Mexico said he was incredibly insulted by Trumps remarks and asked whether the presidential hopeful would build walls around every state to prevent criminals from entering the United States., I was waiting for this, Trump said. Did the government of Mexico ask you to come up here and say this?, Trump said he would build a wall between the United States and Mexico, and that he encouraged legal immigration., But what I dont encourage is people coming into our country illegally, he said, to the applause and whistling of audience members., In recent weeks, several companies, including NBCUniversal and Macys, have severed ties with the real estate mogul. Moreover, some Republicans have denounced Trumps comments and sought to distance themselves as the party looks to make inroads with Latino voters  a crucial voting bloc  ahead of the 2016 election., Top Republicans in Arizona, including Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake and Gov. Doug Ducey, did not attend Trumps convention center rally., Both McCain and Flake supported a bipartisan comprehensive immigration proposal that passed the Senate in 2013 but ultimately stalled in the Republican-controlled House. At its core, the bill would have increased the number of agents patrolling the border while allowing some immigrants living in the country illegally to obtain registered provisional immigrant status if they entered the country before 2011., In cable television interviews this week, McCain lambasted Trumps remarks as offensive, saying a majority of Arizonans would disagree with his views., The recent death of Kathryn Steinle, a 32-year-old shot while walking along San Franciscos Embarcadero, has amplified Trumps tough stance on illegal immigration. Accused gunman Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez was in the country illegally and previously had been deported., On Friday, Trump sought to hammer home his calls for stricter immigration reforms by meeting in Los Angeles with family members whose loved ones were killed in accidents and crimes by assailants alleged to be in the country illegally., People came into the country illegally and killed their children, Trump said, referring to the families who stood alongside him in Los Angeles.

{"Content": "[[, To call it a profitable year for Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton would be an understatement., The couple has banked more than $25 million since the start of 2014 through giving speeches alone, a federal disclosure shows. They traveled the world, from Los Angeles to Edmonton to Orlando, collecting an average of $250,000 per appearance., They collected their speaking fees from buttoned-down companies like GE and Bank of America, the lesser-known Institute of Scrap RecyclingIndustries and a firm called Salesforce.com. The former president and his wife, a candidate for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, hit the speaking circuit hard, appearing before audiences to deliver remarks 100 times in 17 months., Sometimes they could not even be at the event in person. But that did not stop the sought-after political heavyweights from capturing a windfall in speaking fees. Novo Nordisk in Mexico City paid a $125,000 honorarium to watch Hillary Clinton over satellite. The California Medical Assn. gave her $100,000 for an appearance beamed in electronically to San Diego., Clinton revealed the payments Friday night, as part of a campaign disclosure candidates must file with 30 days of launching their run for office. The filing also showed that sales of her newest book, \"Hard Choices,\" are adding considerably to the Clinton fortune. She reported collecting more than $5 million in royalties., But it is the speaking fees that threaten to make things awkward for her on the campaign trail. The eye-popping amounts the Clintons have collected -- mostly from companies with considerable business before the federal government -- drew rebukes from political opponents., Republicans were quick to roll out the recent footage of Bill Clinton telling an NBC News reporter that collecting the fees was necessary because the family needs to pay its bills., \"The Clintons claim that staggering amounts of income from paid speaking fees that raise ethical questions and potential conflicts of interest is simply to pay our bills shows how out of touch theyve truly become, said Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus., The disclosure is sure to be another distraction for Hillary Clinton, who is focusing her run on everyday Americans and has made campaign finance reform a key part of her platform. Republicans are delighting in the contrast between the ultra-wealthy Clinton and the struggling middle-class workers her campaign invites to roundtables with the candidate., The steep speaking fees have been a source of unwanted attention for the Clintons in the past, which they have deflected by noting that much of the money went to their family foundation., But lately, the foundation itself has become a magnet for controversy., Clintons campaign has had to mount a spirited defense against allegations that the millions of dollars in foreign donations the foundation accepted while she was secretary of State reflect a conflict of interest. The transactions are detailed in the recently released book \"Clinton Cash,\" by conservative author Peter Schweizer. He acknowledges that he did not uncover the Clintons engaging in any criminal activity., Staff writer Kurtis Lee in Los Angeles contributed to this report., @evanhalper, 7:15 p.m.: This story has been updated with background on the Clinton familys foundation., This story was originally published at 6:55 p.m.]", "Date": "20150515", "Title": "[Clintons made $25 million in year of giving speeches, filing shows]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-hillary-clinton-financial-disclosures-20150515-story.html", "Author": "[Evan Halper]"}

{"Content": "[[, To the editor: In arguing that Hillary Rodham Clinton should run a liberal campaign, Jamelle Bouie skews electoral history. (\"The changing face of centrist campaigning,\" op-ed, June 13), Its true that Bill Clinton never won a majority of the vote, but thats because there was a third-party candidate (Ross Perot) in 1992 and 1996, not because of his centrist message. Perot ran on a conservative, debt-reduction platform., Despite that, in 1996, Clinton routed Bob Dole by 49.2% to 40.7%. This was more than twice the popular-vote margin by which President Obama defeated Republican Mitt Romney in his 2012 reelection campaign., Moreover, Obamas election victory in 2008 (52.9% to 45.7%) was modest considering the GOPs stewardship over our worst economic collapse since 1932 and the senseless war in Iraq.

How many undecided? How much spending on persuasion and how much turning out the environmental-minded vote?, Later, touring an eco-friendly farm, Steyer asks about the compost used to grow the organic figs and wild berries. Is manure part of the mix?, In short order, the inquisitive San Francisco hedge-fund billionaire has become one of the most powerful players in American politics, sinking tens of millions of his fortune into boosting Democrats and trying to elevate global warming from a political afterthought into a top-tier issue., Hes built an organization that includes some of the countrys top campaign strategists. Hes won a following among environmental activists thrilled at his free-spending ways  hes drawn at least $40 million from his own checkbook this election cycle  and recruited a nationwide legion of green-thinking volunteers., His political organization, NextGen Climate Action, is focused on seven campaigns across the country: U.S. Senate contests in Iowa, Colorado, New Hampshire and Michigan and gubernatorial races in Florida, Maine and Pennsylvania. Hes also invested in some state legislative races, including Democratic efforts to win back a two-thirds majority in Sacramento., In the process Steyer has drawn the enmity of conservatives, who paint him as the epitome of smug I-know-whats-best-for-you liberalism: a radical leftist billionaire hypocrite who wants to kill jobs and raise gas prices while perched snugly in his Sea Cliff mansion. Hes even inspired the Republican Party to create a website, MeetTomSteyer, devoted entirely to disparaging \"Steyer the Liar.\", Through it all he displays the casual comportment and breezy self-assurance of someone rich enough to treat money as though it doesnt really matter. He professes to be quite comfortable on the receiving end of attacks, the product of an age when deep-pocketed donors such as Steyer on the left and the Koch brothers on the right are often higher-profile targets than those seeking office. \"This is full-contact sports, and  people are going to say nasty things about me,\" Steyer says with a shrug., Although his efforts so far appear unavailing  polls consistently show climate change low on the list of voter priorities  he is determined to inject the issue into the next presidential race and is talked about as a possible 2018 candidate for governor of California, where he honed his advocacy by pushing through ballot measures on taxes and climate change., All of which raise a number of questions for Steyer himself: What do issues such as same-sex marriage and shipping jobs overseas, featured in attack ads hes paid for in Colorado and Iowa, have to do with climate change? Has Steyer hurt his credibility with claims that fact-checkers have deemed misleading and even patently false, such as an ad suggesting Floridas governor was soft on polluters who enriched his campaign? And how much of his conservationist crusade is about him and a future run for office? , Working his way through a cheeseburger, Steyer defends his advertising  \"I have not seen anything  that I did not think was supportable,\" he says., And he rules out a gubernatorial bid  sort of. \"I have no plans,\" he insists, \"and thats no joke.\", He has come a long way from his first campaign experience, as a lowly fundraiser for Walter Mondales 1984 presidential race, when he was shocked by the casual cruelty of politics. Presented with one of the attack mailers he has paid for against Joni Ernst, Iowas Republican Senate candidate, Steyer throws his head back and laughs, a deep throaty chortle., He waves it merrily, then returns to performance metrics. \"What,\" he demands of his Iowa campaign team, \"do you think the delta will be for our effort?\", Part of the Steyer lore is the role of unassuming billionaire, and he is easygoing and approachable as he chats up small groups of college students across Iowa., On Day Two of his state tour he wears the same toad-green sport coat, frayed-at-the-cuff khakis and signature tie, a red tartan plaid, as the day before. He may be the countrys biggest individual political donor this year, but no one looks twice as Steyer strolls across campus., Climate change, Steyer tells his young audiences, is the seismic issue of our day, akin to being on the right side of the American Revolution or the Civil War. But \"its not just a question of understanding,\" he tells an earnest group of Iowa State volunteers. \"Its a question of thinking that its important.\", Steyer has some way to go in convincing Americans of that; even his lavish spending is not likely to make climate change the deciding factor in any of the U.S. Senate or gubernatorial contests hes targeted., \"I would say its near the bottom of issues people are motivated by,\" said Andrew Smith, a pollster at the University of New Hampshire, who has been sampling opinion in the state for well over a decade., Others say the same. \"If your life is fine and youre not worried about next weeks paycheck  and youre not buried in student loans, youve got the luxury to think about global warming,\" said Michael Fraioli, a longtime Democratic strategist working on several campaigns this year. \"But if youre worried about next week, or what happens six months from now, youve got more immediate concerns.\", Steyer doesnt entirely disagree., The states he aimed at are places where Democrats can talk about climate change without the risk they face in, say, conservative-leaning Louisiana, Kentucky or Georgia, which also have highly competitive Senate races. His absence there is tacit admission that, whatever the merits Steyer sees in his argument, the politics are not yet on his side., That also explains NextGens far-afield advertising, on issues including jobs and contraception, which are much more likely to stir Democratic voters than global warming., Steyer suggests there is a connection, that candidates he deems wrong on such issues as birth control are probably also wrong on climate change. \"If youre too extreme,\" he says, \"these things all go together.\", After a privileged upbringing on New Yorks Upper East Side, college at Yale and then Stanford business school, Steyer passed through the wealth-creating portals of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs before moving to California and founding his own hedge fund, Farallon Capital Management, in 1986., Part of his fortune comes from investments in companies Steyer now blames for global warming, though he says he is 100% divested from fossil fuels after the New York Times and Washington Post this year detailed his financial ties to coal mines and other polluters. \"Im trying to at least be congruent and consistent in what I do,\" he says., Steyer, a longtime Democratic donor, financed a 2010 California ballot measure that successfully beat back repeal of the states landmark law fighting climate change, and another in 2012 that hiked taxes $1 billion for out-of-state corporations to pay for conservation and alternative energy programs., What really drew notice, though, was a stated intention this spring to spend $100 million  half Steyers money, half raised from supporters  to make global warming an overriding issue in the midterm election. Fundraising has fallen drastically short of that goal, however; the NextGen political action committee collected nearly $43 million through August, the end of the last reporting period, and all but about $2 million of that came from Steyer., He now says he has no idea where the $100-million figure originated, blaming \"somebody I dont know who has never owned up to it.\", Actually, Steyers political strategists suggested the sum, both in public and private., \"Things change and the budget changes,\" he says, striding unperturbed across the rainy University of Iowa campus to thank another group of volunteers. \"We are going to be able to do what we need to do.\", He also cautions against drawing conclusions before all the votes are cast and the postelection data are crunched. \"It aint over until its over,\" Steyer says, suggesting his efforts could make a meaningful difference in November in, say, a close governors race in Florida, or the hard-fought Senate contest here in Iowa., He calls this \"one round of what were doing.\" Already, Steyers hoping to build on this years efforts in 2016, when not just the Senate but the White House will be up for grabs., mark.barabak@latimes.com, Twitter: @markzbarabak]", "Date": "20141011", "Title": "[Tom Steyer's climate change crusade focuses on midterm races, for now]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-tom-steyer-environment-2014-elections-20141012-story.html", "Author": "[Mark Z.

{"Content": "[[, Twelve months before the voting is set to begin, the 2016 presidential race is shaping up as a fiercely competitive contest driven by two overriding forces that  candidates aside  will go a long way toward deciding the next occupant of the White House., Whoever Democrats nominate  Hillary Rodham Clinton being the heavy favorite  will face the inherently difficult task of winning the presidency for the party for the third time in a row. That has happened only once since Harry Truman was elected more than half a century ago: in 1988 when Republican George H.W. Bush succeeded President Reagan., \"People always choose, even if you have a popular president, the remedy [to] and not the replica of what they have,\" said David Axelrod, a Democratic strategist who twice helped Barack Obama win the White House., At the same time, Republicans face another wide-open contest for their nomination  and, with it, a gravitational pull from the right flank of the party. That wing of the GOP is far more conservative than the country as a whole, potentially making the winner less appealing to a broader November electorate., \"The stark reality that Republicans face is that the nation is younger and its more diverse ethnically,\" said Dick Wadhams, a Republican strategist in Colorado, a state expected to be among the hardest-fought in 2016. \"Weve got to have a Republican who can speak to that reality.\", With each side facing hurdles, the bottom line is a presidential contest that could be the most competitive since at least 2000, when the U.S. Supreme Court stepped in after weeks of legal jousting to break an effective tie and put Bushs son George W. in the White House., The Republican field is expected to be large and varied, including competing U.S. senators  Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas and possibly Marco Rubio of Florida; governors, including New Jerseys Chris Christie and Wisconsins Scott Walker; some repeat candidates, including outgoing Texas Gov. Rick Perry, as well as Jeb Bush, a former governor of Florida., Bush starts out with a number of considerable advantages, not least an expansive nationwide network of donors and political loyalists dating from when his father and older brother ran for president and served in the White House., He is also the favorite of many establishment Republicans eager to avoid the sort of prolonged and acrimonious primary battle that undercut the partys 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney, by pushing him rightward on issues like contraception and immigration., But it is too soon to call Bush  or any candidate, for that matter  the Republican front-runner., The party remains deeply divided between its governing wing, which is eager to show voters that Washington can work to implement functional conservative policies, and insurgents like Paul and Cruz, who favor a more ideological and confrontational approach., \"This nomination is going to be a fight,\" said Scott Reed, a veteran GOP strategist who ran Bob Doles 1996 presidential campaign. \"Its not going to be a layup for anybody.\", Apart from their philosophical divide, Republicans face a country that is changing by the day, as Latinos and Asian Americans become a larger and increasingly potent share of the electorate. Many are first- and second-time voters who have spurned the GOP, due in good part to the harsh rhetoric and hard-line stance on immigration embraced by some in the party., Q. Whitfield Ayres, a longtime Republican pollster, says that Obama would have lost to Arizona Sen. John McCain in 2008 had the electorate been the same as 1980, when Ronald Reagan first won the White House. Whites made up 88% of the electorate then, compared with 74% in 2008; if the recent trend continues, the share of white voters may be 70% or less in November 2016., \"We need someone who can more appeal to working-class whites than Mitt Romney was able to do and more appeal to  Hispanics and Asians than Romney was able to do,\" said Ayres, who has worked with Rubio in his Florida campaigns. \"Then we will blunt the effect of those longer-term forces that favor the Democrats.\", In the short term, though, it is Democrats who must overcome one of the most elemental forces in politics: the hunger for change., An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll in December found that more than 7 in 10 voters wanted Obamas successor to take a different approach from the incumbent, a not-unusual level of fatigue with a president deep into his second term. After six tumultuous years, even Axelrod, the Obama strategist, sees voters wanting someone different from the president., \"Someone who knows how to navigate the inside game,\" Axelrod suggested. \"Someone whos a little less nuanced, less sensitive to the gray.\", If that sounds somewhat like Clinton, consider that Democrats often dont settle on their initial front-runner, or else embrace them only after an extended primary fight. Moreover, after two highly conspicuous decades in public life  as first lady, New York senator, presidential candidate and Obamas secretary of State  Clinton is hardly the fresh face that Democrats typically yearn for., Clinton does, though, hold out the prospect of becoming the first female president, which, in itself, represents a break from the past. \"If you want to seize the change mantle ... that would certainly be historic,\" said Don Sipple, a political ad man whose past clients include George W. Bush, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jerry Brown., Although no serious Clinton challenger has yet emerged, several Democrats have taken at least preliminary steps toward a 2016 campaign. Outgoing Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley has been an abundant presence in early-voting states, and former Virginia Sen. James Webb has launched an exploratory effort. Vermont Sen.

{"Content": "[[, Twenty-two months ahead of the 2016 election, the nascent presidential campaign already has a leading issue: the economys failure to produce rising incomes for the middle class., From World War II through the 1970s, virtually all working Americans saw paychecks rise. Those gains have become uneven since the 1980s, however, and in the last 15 years, they stopped for most families., Americans at the middle of the income ladder now earn less, adjusted for inflation, than they did in 2000. Small gains during the early years of the last decade were wiped away by the deep recession that began in 2007., Although economic growth has resumed, the stock market has soared into record territory, and the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits has fallen to its lowest level in nearly 15 years, income has remained stuck except for those at the very top., Voters have noticed. A Gallup poll released Friday, for example, showed that two-thirds of Americans said they were dissatisfied with the way income and wealth are distributed in the U.S., The unhappiness was most pronounced among those earning $30,000 to $75,000, roughly the middle third of the U.S. population. Nearly 80% expressed dissatisfaction., That discontent has begun to shape the agendas of presidential hopefuls in both parties., The issue has moved Democrats to the left, bolstering arguments for a more aggressive effort to redistribute income away from the wealthiest Americans and to do more to help families who earn far less., The impact can be seen in the budget that President Obama released Monday and in a recent policy blueprint from a group closely aligned with former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. Both advocated increasing taxes on inherited wealth to pay for tax cuts and wage supplements for middle-class and lower-income working families., Republicans also have begun talking about the issue, as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush did Wednesday in a speech to the Detroit Economic Club. Among other goals, Republicans hope to underscore the fact that income inequality has worsened on Obamas watch., Until recently, most Republicans dismissed arguments about inequality as an invitation to what they labeled as \"class warfare.\" Now Bush, as well as Floridas Republican senator, Marco Rubio, and other GOP hopefuls have publicly identified the issue as a key problem facing the country., \"The fact that Republicans are feeling they have to talk about inequality\" testifies to the issues power, said Dartmouth College political scientist Brendan Nyhan., The language Republicans use, at least to describe the problem, often sounds much like Democratic rhetoric., Bushs Right to Rise political action committee, for example, declares in its mission statement that millions of Americans feel \"the playing field is no longer fair or level,\" a metaphor also employed by the liberals hero Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for her PAC. In his speech, Bush said Americans were frustrated seeing \"only a small portion of the population riding the economys up escalator.\", Rubio, at a recent breakfast for reporters sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor, said the country had experienced a \"recovery at the upper echelons in the economy.\", \"So much of the recovery over the last couple of years has gone to such a small segment of the population that now middle-class and upward-mobility stagnation has become more apparent,\" he said. \"I think its good that theres a consensus thats what we need to focus on.\", Republicans have criticized Obamas proposals, saying they would just make the problem worse. Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, for example, accused Obama of preaching \"envy economics\" in his budget, and Bush said in his speech that liberals had built \"a spider web that traps people in perpetual dependence\" instead of providing incentives for business growth., Beyond that criticism, Republicans have had an easier time identifying the problem than proposing solutions. Bush, for example, said he would outline proposals in \"coming weeks.\" Even identifying the problem, however, can help a campaign, at least initially., \"Its a way to demonstrate that I care about your needs. I care about the average voter,\" said pollster Margie Omero of the bipartisan firm Purple Strategies, based in Alexandria, Va. \"Does he get me? is the door\" that candidates have to get through before voters will listen to policy prescriptions., When the argument does get to policies, Republicans face the problem that stagnant wages challenge a cornerstone of their economic creed. The GOP has historically argued that growth benefits all segments of society and that, as a result, government can largely leave economic affairs to the free market., The results of the last 15 years undermine the idea that a rising tide reliably lifts all boats., Even as the economy has rebounded from the recession, which technically ended in mid-2009, nearly all the gains have gone to the top., In the first three years of the recovery, 91% of income gains went to the wealthiest 1% of households, a group with incomes above roughly $400,000, UC Berkeley economics professor Emmanuel Saez has found., Inequality has reached levels not seen since the 1920s, his data show., Democrats argue that the trend shows the need for a more active role for government. The U.S. and other major economies have experienced a \"toxic combination of too little growth and rising inequality,\" a panel of Democratic economists and policymakers with close ties to Clinton recently declared., The group, headed by Lawrence H. Summers, who served as Treasury secretary under President Clinton and as chief White House economic advisor under Obama, issued a report that has been widely seen as an early draft of a Hillary Clinton economic platform, should she decide to run., The report was published by the Center for American Progress, a Washington think tank that is headed by Neera Tanden, policy director for Clintons 2008 presidential campaign. It was previously run by John Podesta, the White House counselor, who is expected to head her 2016 effort., Their report contends that the yawning gap between the wealthy and everyone else contradicts Americas belief in social mobility and hurts the economy overall. Thats because the wealthy tend to spend proportionally less of their income than middle-class families do, so concentrated wealth leads to lower demand for goods and services., Globalized competition, changes in technology that have eliminated many low-skill jobs and the declining power of labor unions have all played a big role in producing the problem, it says., Over the long term, the group says, the surest path to higher incomes is improved education to increase the skills of the U.S. workforce. But that could take years to show an impact. In the meantime, many Americans will continue to struggle to gain financial security, the report says., To combat that, the report offers a menu of policies that add up to a relatively liberal, populist economic platform that Clinton could espouse. They include steps to strengthen unions, an expansion of wage supplements for low-income workers, a middle-class tax cut and more spending on roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects to generate jobs and improve the economys productivity., To pay for those measures, the report advocates increased taxes on inherited wealth as well as closing what the report labels as unjustified tax loopholes for corporations and wealthy individuals., On the Republican side, most potential candidates have not come up with similarly detailed proposals, although Rubio laid out several ideas in a new book he is promoting., GOP hopefuls have generally argued that Obamas policies should take the blame for stagnant wages, saying that too much regulation and high taxes have stifled business growth and job creation., For Republicans, however, a credible plan for expanding middle-class incomes may be a necessity for 2016., In the last election, polls showed one of Obamas strongest advantages was the voter perception that he, more than Republican nominee Mitt Romney, cared about the problems of average Americans. Changing that impression will be even more important this time around, when Democrats hope to finally be able to brag about solid economic growth and unemployment at or below 5%., Accomplishing that goal is not impossible but will require the GOP to fight on what voters have traditionally seen as Democratic turf. Republicans, said Omero, \"have a lot of ground to make up.\", david.lauter@latimes.com, Twitter: @DavidLauter]", "Date": "20150205", "Title": "[Income inequality emerges as key issue in 2016 presidential campaign]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-campaign-income-20150205-story.html", "Author": "[David Lauter]"}

They loudly cheered calls to assert American muscle abroad, to scrap the Iran nuclear deal and to attack establishment politicians in Washington., The sponsor was Heritage Action for America, the advocacy arm of the right-wing Heritage Foundation, whose ardent opposition to immigration helped quash a reform movement in 2013. The group is among those now pressuring Republicans in Congress to shut down the government rather than appropriate any money to Planned Parenthood, a cause that has stirred the antiabortion fervor in the partys base., No candidate drew a reception that matchedthe standing, rock-star ovation that greeted Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon whos climbed near the top of polls in recent weeks. When Carson said it was his birthday, the crowdsang, Happy Birthday., Carson drew more cheers when he talked about his faith  I get tired of progressives telling me Im not a good scientist because I believe God created the Earth  and kept the crowd on his side when he said he continued to support a guest worker program for people in the U.S. illegally. He said farmers told him they need the labor., Any type of work that Americans dont want to do, we ought to think of a way to get it done, Carson said. As for deporting everyone who is in the country illegally, he said, I dont think its possible to round them all up. The judicial system would be clogged for many, many years., Carol Coring, 65, of Greenville, said she came mostly to see Carson, and he didnt disappoint. In the so-called racist South, he brought the house down, she said of Carson, the only African American running for president. He doesnt have a lot of charisma, but he has so much native intelligence., Coring, who said she worked in rock management in New York before her retirement, said many in the crowd were only shopping for political outsiders. People think theres no place else to turn at this point, she said. We elected a Republican Senate and House, and they havent managed to do a damn thing., Missing was Donald Trump, the outsize television personality whos been the star of the GOP campaign. Trump had pledged to come but pulled out on Friday morning, saying he had to take care of some unspecified significant business event. The campaign said the details of that event would be made public next week., This has been a rocky week for Trump, who faced zingers from other candidates at Wednesdays debate and has taken criticism from both Democrats and Republicans for failing to correct a man who said, at a campaign event in New Hampshire, that President Obama is a Muslim and not even an American., Most people in this crowd didnt seem to miss Trump much., Donald Trump is a chump, said Tim Eades, of Lexington, S.C. If the Republicans are stupid enough to put Donald Trump up there, Ill vote for Hillary. Well, not really, but Ill stay home., Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker drew applause when he talked about fighting unions and doing away with the National Labor Relations Board  but got a much bigger response when he talked about defunding Planned Parenthood., If we can do that in a Democratic state like Wisconsin, why cant we do it in Washington? he asked. We dont have to buy this stuff the media says about shutdowns., All of the candidates tried to hit the anti-establishment theme, even former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whosefather and brother are former presidents. People are quite compliant with the old order [in Washington], and there needs to be a lot of disruption, he said., Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard executive who turned in a strong debate performance, also got an enthusiastic reception, particularly when she assailed what she called the butchery and barbarity of Planned Parenthood., Fiorina referred to some of the more negative aspects of her tenure at Hewlett-Packard, which included plunging profits and the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs -- a history that dogged her during her losing 2010 campaign for a U.S. Senate seat in California., Its very difficult and painful to tell people they dont have a job anymore, yet sometimes that has to be done, she said. When you have someone who is competent, who is producing results but who does not have the core values that matter, those are the hard decisions., Outside the arena, some waved Confederate battle flags, a show of defiance against South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who pushed for the flag to be taken down from the Statehouse grounds after the massacre at a historic black church in Charleston in June. Haley was one of the moderators Friday., One attendee, 72-year-old Marcia Bogan from Spartanburg, said she was intrigued by Trumps contempt for political correctness. She is longing for an alternative to the Republicans in Washington, she said, whom she viewed as siding with Obama., Whats wrong with people in our Congress?\" she said. \"Theyre completely compliant with absolutely everything Obama is doing.

{"Content": "[[, Two decades after California voters took a hard line on illegal immigration, affirmative action and bilingual education, an ascendant class of Latino lawmakers is seeking to rewrite the books and discard the polarizing laws., Flexing its growing clout in Sacramento, this generation of legislators is returning to the 1990s-era fights that propelled them into politics. On Monday, they will mark 20 years since Proposition 187  the landmark initiative withholding public services such as healthcare and education from those in the country illegally  qualified for the ballot., Sen. Ricardo Lara (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Latino Legislative Caucus, said there is a satisfying \"full circle\" feel in revisiting these formative struggles with Latinos now empowered., But others say the legislators are falling back on yesterdays battles for use as a political cudgel  a move that could risk alienating other voters., Even two decades later, the feelings about Proposition 187 remain raw., The measure barred healthcare, education and other public services for people in the country illegally. It required doctors, teachers and others to report suspected violators of immigration laws., For Lara, whose parents were not legal residents, the proposal felt like a \"blatant, direct attack\" on his family and those like them., Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, who led the campaign for Proposition 187, bristled at descriptions of the initiative as xenophobic and racist., \"They are playing the race card and trying to intimidate people who had the spunk and the logic to protest against Washington, D.C., and Mexico City, who had been quite content to allow state taxpayers to be stuck with the cost of federally mandated services to illegal immigrants,\" Wilson said in an interview. \"Frankly, its beneath contempt.\", The measure  largely struck down as unconstitutional  was approved by 59% of voters in 1994. But its passage led to a surge of voter registration and political advocacy among Latinos., In the 20 years since, Latinos have become the largest ethnic group in the state, and their share of the electorate has doubled. So has the number of Latinos in the Legislature., \"It was 187  I cannot overemphasize  that unified the community,\" said Antonia Hernndez, former leader of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, a civil rights group., The measure also bound Latinos to the Democratic Party., Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said the \"mean-spirited, cynical ploy\" by Republicans to push the initiative ultimately backfired., \"That created a generation of Democrats,\" he said., Two years later, voters approved Proposition 209, which barred affirmative action for college admissions and public hiring decisions. And in 1998, Proposition 227, an initiative that effectively banned bilingual education in public schools, passed with 61% of the vote., \"It was a litany. It didnt let up,\" said Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego), of the successive measures. \"lt just became not OK, in the eyes of far too many Californians, to even be Latino.\", Gonzalez, like Lara, was a college student when Proposition 187 was on the ballot; both attended campus rallies against it. Sen. Kevin De Len (D-Los Angeles), the incoming Senate leader, was a lead organizer of a massive downtown Los Angeles rally in the fall of 1994., \"I cut my teeth politically organizing immigrants,\" De Len said., Now De Len is pushing a bill to strip much of the language of Proposition 187 from statute. The bulk of the law was overturned by a federal court, but references to it remain in the state code. (Two provisions that survived court scrutiny dealing with false residency papers would remain law under De Lens bill.), It is time, he said, \"to erase its stain from our books.\", David Hayes-Bautista, a professor of medicine at UCLA who has written extensively about California Latinos, said that just as the state has apologized for other blemishes in its history, such as internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, so too should it acknowledge the pain felt by Latinos because of Proposition 187., \"This is one way to try to address and repair the past,\" he said., In addition, a measure by Sen. Ed Hernandez (D-West Covina) would repeal parts of Proposition 209 in order to allow race-conscious college admissions. And Lara is seeking to undo and amend portions of Proposition 227 in order to expand access to multilingual educational programs. Both bills, should they pass the Legislature, would need to be approved by voters in 2016., \"These are policies that Californians have had to live with for 20 years, and we think the voters should be given an opportunity to revisit them,\" Hernandez said., But Mike Madrid, a GOP consultant, said Latino politicians have made the decades-old fights a \"disproportionately large part of the agenda.\" He said he hopes these lawmakers will now focus more on economic and educational disparities facing the community., \"Let this end also be a beginning of something new,\" Madrid said. \"Lets not keep rehashing the same thing.\", Assemblyman Rocky Chvez (R-Oceanside), one of two Latino Republicans in the Legislature, said he would vote to strike Prop. 187 from the record., \"It shouldnt be there,\" he said. \"It was wrong.\", But he said some of his Democratic counterparts were \"caught in the political rhetoric\" of the past, in hopes of creating a \"wedge issue\" to drive Latino turnout in the November elections., Democrats continue to hold a commanding registration lead among Latinos  55% of Latino voters are Democrats, according to Political Data Inc., a voter tracking firm, while 17% are Republican  but turnout in the community can lag, particularly in years without a presidential election., But revisiting these issues is not without peril for Democrats. Hernandezs measure provoked a backlash this year among some Asian Americans who feared that their community could lose college admission slots if affirmative action was allowed. Lara acknowledges that Latino Democrats were caught \"flat-footed\" by the outcry., \"It was a very sobering moment,\" said Antonia Hernndez, now president of the philanthropic group California Community Foundation. She blamed complacency in outreach to Asians and other groups., The misstep prompted questions of overreach., Ward Connerly, a former UC regent who backed Proposition 209, said he thinks efforts to repeal portions of it will backfire., \"Our side will argue they are opening the door to discrimination,\" he said. \"And racial discrimination is abhorrent to most Californians.\", De Len said he did not expect public backlash because \"California has come a long way.\", Gonzalez acknowledged that revisiting some of these past battles gets her generation of lawmakers \"in trouble sometimes.\" But to not take up those issues now that theyre in the Capitol?, \"Oh no,\" she said. \"Weve been fighting for this for way too long.\", melanie.mason@latimes.com, patrick.mcgreevy@latimes.com, Twitter:, @melmason, @mcgreevy99]", "Date": "20140622", "Title": "[Latino lawmakers move to reverse decades of anti-immigrant legislation]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-pol-legislature-latinos-20140622-story.html", "Author": "[Melanie Mason, Patrick McGreevy]"}

Businesses added 414,000 jobs in November, the government now says, the most in 17 years. Total job gains in December were also revised higher, to 329,000, up from 252,000., Average hourly wages, meanwhile, jumped 12 cents to $24.75, the biggest gain since September 2008. In the past year, hourly pay has increased 2.2 percent., The unemployment rate rose to 5.7 percent from 5.6 percent. But thats not necessarily a bad thing. More Americans began looking for jobs, though not all found work. Their job hunting suggests they are more confident about their prospects., That is ahead of inflation, which rose just 0.7 percent in 2014. The sharp drop in gas prices in the past year has held down inflation and boosted Americans spending power. Still, wages typically increase at a 3.5 percent pace in a fully healthy economy., Strong hiring pushes up wages as employers compete for fewer workers. Job gains have now averaged 336,000 a month for the past three months, the best three-month pace in 17 years. Just a year ago, the three-month average was only 197,000., The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring wages and other job market data as it considers when to begin raising the short-term interest rate it controls from a record low near zero. The Fed has kept rates at record lows for more than six years to help stimulate growth. Most economists think the central bank will start boosting rates as early as June. , Steady economic growth has encouraged companies to keep hiring. The economy expanded at a 4.8 percent annual rate during spring and summer, the fastest six-month pace in a decade, before slowing to a still-decent 2.6 percent pace in the final three months of 2014. , There are now 3.2 million more Americans earning paychecks than there were 12 months ago. That lifts consumer spending, which drives about 70 percent of economic growth. , More hiring, along with sharply lower gasoline prices, has boosted Americans confidence and spending power.

{"Content": "[[, Unless a surprise GOP candidate emerges, the U.S. Senate race in California will mark the third straight election with the partys top-of-the-ticket state candidate given virtually no chance of victory, even by fellow Republicans., The dearth of candidates able to raise enough money to fuel a competitive bid is a reminder of how far the party has fallen in the state that gave rise to Presidents Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon., I would love to say a Republican has a really decent chance, said GOP strategist Beth Miller. But right now, given what the political landscape looks like in California, it will be an uphill battle for any Republican., The diminished prospects for GOP candidates are not new  former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger warned Republican leaders in 2007 that their party was dying at the box office., The state has grown increasingly liberal in recent years as it has grown more diverse. And a fast-growing segment of the electorate  Latinos  was alienated by GOP backing of Proposition 187, the 1994 ballot measure that would have denied taxpayer-funded services to people in the country illegally but was ultimately gutted by the courts., Today, the partys problem is acute, said Adam Mendelsohn, a former GOP political strategist and advisor to Schwarzenegger., Before, it was just a refusal to acknowledge losing voters, Mendelsohn said. Now its a broad understanding of losing voters and people not feeling motivated enough to run for office., Democratic Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris announced her candidacy within days of Sen. Barbara Boxers announcement that she would not seek reelection in 2016 and has been busy raising money and securing endorsements. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and a handful of the partys members of Congress are weighing bids., The Republicans have been most notable for those sitting the race out. They include Rep. Darrell Issa and major donor Charles Munger Jr., who could both easily fund a campaign themselves, and Kevin Faulconer, mayor of San Diego, the largest city in the nation led by a Republican., There appears to be little or no interest by the top GOP candidates in last years election, all of whom lost. Gubernatorial candidate Neel Kashkari and Pete Peterson, who ran for secretary of state, confirmed Friday that they are not running for the Senate seat., Fresno Mayor Ashley Swearengin, who ran for state controller in November, is more likely to run for an executive position in 2018, according to adviser Tim Clark., Former Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, who unsuccessfully ran in the gubernatorial primary last year, said Friday that he hadnt ruled out a Senate bid and was enjoying watching the field emerge., The Republicans who have said publicly that they are considering a run are little known and, like many others, would probably struggle to raise money.Assemblyman Rocky Chavez excites some in the GOP because hes a Latino Republican with a legislative track record. He was elected to the state Legislature in 2012 and previously served seven years on the Oceanside City Council., Chavez was in Washington, D.C., on Friday, meeting with national GOP officials about a potential bid., Two former chairmen of the state GOP, Duf Sundheim and Tom Del Beccaro, are also considering running., Sundheim said he had been talking to voters, who want to have a competitive election., He said he was encouraged by the response from both voters and donors but will run only if he believes he can raise enough money and see a path to victory., I wouldnt go if I didnt think I had a shot of winning, Sundheim said., Del Beccaro said he expects to make his decision within a month, and if he runs it will be because he believes it is critical for Republicans to have a credible candidate in the contest., Everyone is clear-eyed about the fact that it would be a tough, uphill climb, he said., Del Beccaro also pointed to the still relatively new top two primary system, in which the top two vote getters advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation., California favors Democratic candidates statewide. But if enough Democrats run, it is mathematically possible  though unlikely  that none would garner enough votes, and two Republicans could end up on the general-election ballot., Attempts to reach Chavez were unsuccessful., Democrats already have a steep advantage over Republicans in voter registration in California  43% to 28%., That edge could be magnified in 2016 because the ballot will feature a presidential contest, which typically attracts more young and minority voters who tend toward the Democratic Party., Republicans interested in higher office would have to wait only two years until 2018  when Sen.

{"Content": "[[, Until last week, no Democratic state legislator running for reelection had lost to a Republican in 20 years. Then suddenly three did., When incumbents start losing their legislative seats, it means something is happening., The national Republican wave? Sure. Some of that washed into California. But it wasnt just that., Also credit  or blame  voter-approved reforms that are starting to affect Californias legislative elections., First, voters stripped the Legislature of its power to shamelessly gerrymander districts to protect incumbents. The remapping duty was handed to an independent citizens commission. The first effect was felt in the 2012 elections., The idea was to make redistricting less partisan and the seats more competitive. And its happening., Second, voters adopted the \"top two\" open primary. Starting in 2012, candidates didnt seek party nominations. They sought to finish in the top two, regardless of party, and qualify for the November election. That meant they needed to attract voters outside their own party bases., In theory, this would result in the election of more moderates and fewer party extremists. That also is happening., \"If youre looking for a functional Legislature,\" says Republican consultant Rob Stutzman, \"theres good reason to be optimistic more than at any time in the last decade.\", Democrat consultant David Townsend, who advises an unofficial moderate caucus in the Legislature, says that 15 years ago only six Assembly Democrats were considered moderates. In the next legislative session, he says, half the Assembly Democrats will be., Whats the definition of a moderate? Townsend says Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, asked him that a couple of years ago. \"I said, Jerry, youre a moderate.\", \"The whole mission of moderates,\" Townsend continues, \"is economic growth. If youre out there trying to regulate everything, youre not a moderate.\", Of course, Republicans also can be considered moderates if theyre laissez-faire on social issues such as abortion and gay marriage., Allan Hoffenblum, a former GOP consultant who publishes the California Target Book, which handicaps legislative races, resists using the word moderate. \"I refer to them as representative of their district,\" he says., Hoffenblum dug into the data and found that the last time a Republican legislative candidate had defeated a Democratic incumbent in California was 1994, amidst a national GOP tidal wave., For many years, it was exceedingly rare for a legislative or congressional seat to change parties at all, let alone if held by an incumbent. That is now happening more and more., The three Assembly Democrats who got beaten last week  Steve Fox of Palmdale, Sharon Quirk-Silva of Fullerton and Al Muratsuchi of Torrance  all were initially elected during the 2012 presidential election when the voter turnout was significantly higher. Thats almost always a Democratic advantage. They lost during a ho-hum gubernatorial election when the turnout was abysmally low., The scant turnout helped the Republican winners: Tom Lackey, Young Kim and David Hadley. But they triumphed largely because of the honest redistricting that made the seats competitive. During the 2016 presidential election, its a good bet those three GOP incumbents will be vulnerable to Democratic challenges., \"If the Democratic Legislature had drawn the district lines,\" Hoffenblum says, \"it probably would have decimated the Republican Party.\", The top-two primary is having a moderating influence on politics., One good example is in the Napa-Sonoma wine country. There, Napa County Supervisor Bill Dodd, a Republican-turned-Democrat, was the business-backed moderate in the Assembly primary. He beat out two liberal Democrats to finish in the top two. Dodd easily beat his Republican opponent on Nov. 4 and will replace a more liberal, termed-out Democrat in Sacramento., In many races, \"liberal\" is a matter of degree., Example: In a Democrat versus Democrat race, the less liberal Tony Thurmond, a Richmond City councilman, got business backing to beat the far-left Elizabeth Echols for a traditionally leftist Assembly seat., \"Both labor and business had their wins and losses,\" Hoffenblum says. \"It was mixed. Thats the way it should be. But labor used to win 90% of the time.\", Democrats will continue to dominate the Legislature and be elected from safely Democratic seats, Hoffenblum says, but their ideologies are being diversified because of a need to attract Republican votes  both in the primaries and in same-party general election races., But why is California remaining deep blue while so much of America is turning Republican red?, Pollster Mark DiCamillo of the nonpartisan Field Poll tried to answer that Wednesday. Addressing the Sacramento Press Club, he noted that California had proportionately more minority voters than the rest of the country, and they voted 2-to-1 Democratic., \"But an even bigger factor,\" he added, is that white Californians  unlike white Americans generally  are evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans., Why? Its the coast, he told me. \"Seventy percent of the states population lives in a coastal county. The inland  the Central Valley  looks like much of the rest of the country., \"Whites who live on the coast are more tolerant, more open-minded.\", Again, why? DiCamillo wouldnt guess., My guess: The balmy breezes, soothing temperatures and gorgeous sunsets relax people., But why the low turnout? Pollster Mark Baldassare of the Public Policy Institute of California, speaking to the Press Club, blamed not only the virtually nonexistent gubernatorial race, but the boring ballot propositions., Its ironic that while the legislative races have become more interesting  at least for junkies  the voters have become less interested., george.skelton@latimes.com, Twitter: @LATimesSkelton]", "Date": "20141112", "Title": "[California Legislature is looking more moderate due to voting reforms]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-cap-moderates-20141113-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}

With Mitt Romney included in the poll, he was the respondents first choice with 15 percentage points. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul was second with 14 percentage points and Romney with 13. With Romney out, Walkers lead rose to 16 percentage points and Pauls to 15. First place in a tightly packed field is better than any of the alternatives, but its not that big a deal this far out., The big deal is the vanilla factor. According to Jennifer Jacobs of the Des Moines Register, 51% of caucus-goers want an anti-establishment candidate without a lot of ties to Washington or Wall Street who would change the way things are done and challenge conventional thinking. Meanwhile, 43% prefer a more establishment figure with executive experience who understands business and how to execute ideas., Walker is in the golden spot. He can, like Bill Murray in the movie Groundhog Day listening to Andie MacDowell explain the perfect man, reply thats me to almost everything Republicans want. Executive experience? Challenge conventional thinking? Anti-establishment fighter? Me, me, me., Respondents looking for an establishment candidate said Romney was their first choice. Those preferring an outsider said Paul was their first choice. But both groups said their second choice was a big scoop of Walker., Of course, this can all change. No matter how palatable it is, people can still grow weary of vanilla, and Walker may melt under the pressure. Though having won three statewide elections in four years  in liberal Wisconsin!  thats unlikely., If youre Jeb Bush, Paul, Ted Cruz or nearly all the other candidates  official and unofficial  Walker should have you worried. Right now, most of field is made up of boutique flavors, intensely popular among some, intensely unpopular among others., Pundits talk of the establishment versus tea parties rift in the GOP as a recent development. The truth is this schism is more like a permanent feature of Republican politics., Robert Taft, Barry Goldwater, Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich fought the forces of Thomas Dewey, Nelson Rockefeller, Bob Dole and George H.W. Bush with hammers and tongs for decades, losing many early battles and winning later ones. Richard Nixon brilliantly played both sides against the other, alternating between establishmentarian noblesse oblige and populist hostility to the Georgetown set whenever it served his purposes., These squabbles often took an ideological color, but they were sometimes simply bare-knuckle fights over who got control of the levers of power within the party. Even today, the ideological differences between the anti-establishment Cruz and that supposedly wan vassal of entrenched power, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, are quite small., Bush is doing a phenomenal job securing support from big GOP donors. As a result, the Beltway news corps has dubbed him the front-runner. Republicans have a tradition of picking an anointed one early, Karen Tumulty and Matea Gold of the Washington Post write. That establishment candidate almost always ends up with the nomination, although not without a fight and some speed bumps along the way., Yes and no. The anointed one and the establishment candidate are not necessarily the same person. And what counts as the establishment is often a moving target., Just consider the Bushes. George H.W. Bush ran as the establishment candidate and lost to the anointed candidate in 1980. George W. Bush thought he was anointed in 2000 but ended up having to run as an anti-establishment candidate. Ultimately both got elected, but only after finding peak vanilla. Jeb Bush is a long way from that., jgoldberg@latimescolumnists.com, Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion and Facebook, MORE FROM OPINION: , Are Americans too jaded about politics to care anymore?, Vaccine skeptics and Chris Christie say its about choice.

The old rules just dont seem to apply, and, frankly, the new rules just arent that clear., [If] we want to find our balance again, we have to figure out how to make this new economy work for everyone, she said., Appearing as a keynote speaker at a daylong networking conference for women  following weeks of relative reclusiveness  Clinton shed no new light on her expected presidential bid. During a question-and-answer session, she passed on an invitation to launch her candidacy before the adoring audience, which cheered every coy reference to 2016., All in good time, Clinton said. Theres a lot to think about, let me tell you., That said, the Democrats remarks were a forthright appeal to a pair of vital constituencies she would need to win the White House: the high-achieving professional women thrilled at the prospect of shattering the countrys ultimate glass ceiling, and the less-skilled, low-wage workers who fear technology is rendering them obsolete., Speaking at the Santa Clara Convention Center, in hailing distance from the headquarters of several tech giants, she lamented the industrys poor track record hiring and promoting women, seizing on Apples famous slogan to urge Silicon Valley leaders to think different., The numbers are sobering, Clinton said, and she reeled off several: Just 11% of Silicon Valley executives and 20% of software developers are women. A man with a bachelors degree tends to make 60% more than his female counterpart. On the Forbes list of 100 leading tech investors, just four are women., We can literally count on one hand the number of women who have actually been able to come here and turn their dreams into billion-dollar businesses, Clinton said.

Giuliani  Clinton has quietly worked behind the scenes building the framework for her expected White House run., She has been something of a Silicon Valley regular  Tuesdays appearance was her fourth high-tech-themed event in the area in the last year  and the response was rapturous. More than 5,000 people turned out for the conference, billed as the first annual Lead On Watermark Silicon Valley Conference for Women, paying $245 for a day of motivational speeches and workshops and a box lunch of grilled chicken and organic greens., After her speech, in a conversation with tech columnist Kara Swisher, Clinton offered a broad outline of the themes she would probably sound in a presidential campaign., Whoever runs, she said, must make it a priority to restore economic growth with rising wages for the vast majority of Americans, and we have to restore trust and cooperation within our political system., Asked what a supposed president could do to deliver that economic vision, Clinton called for a higher minimum wage, pay equity for women and paid family leave. She suggested finding a way to help the good guys in business by eliminating the pressure they say they face for short-term profits so they can invest for the longer-term good of the economy and their workers., Touching briefly on others issues, Clinton endorsed the concept of net neutrality  ensuring all content on the Web is treated equally by service providers  and condemned former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden for his voluminous leaking of classified information. Though there need to be limits on the sort of domestic surveillance revealed by Snowden, Clinton said, she could never condone what he did., The front-runner for the Democratic nomination, who receives hundreds of thousands of dollars for her appearances, has another paid speech scheduled March 19 at a conference organized by the New York and New Jersey chapter of the American Camp Assn.

A formal election kickoff is set for the end of May in Vermont., Sanders, who has a history of running uphill races, is expected to make economic issues and, specifically, the anxieties of the working- and middle-class a focal point of his campaign, if only to press Clinton to more forcefully address them., In his extensive travels around the country, part of the soundings he took before deciding to run, Sanders has struck an uncompromisingly liberal stance, an antidoteas some on the left see itto Clintons more centrist approach., Among his proposals, Sanders calls for free college tuition, a $1-trillion program to rebuild the nations roads and bridges, government-run healthcare, higher taxes on the wealthy and publicly funded elections to reduce the influence of the countrys rich donors., He would break up the nations big financial institutions, and he opposes trade agreements, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership that President Obama is pushing, which Sanders says have punished workers by shipping jobs overseas., A former mayor of Burlington, Vt., the 73-year-old Sanders was elected to the House in 1990.

He may be the most hypocritical candidate voters have ever seen, which isnt easy to be, because of his history making money off energy investments that conflict with his political platform., An advisor to Steyer said the threatened move highlights the potency of Steyers potential bid., \"They have tried this before and lost in an embarrassing fashion, and trying it again only proves the fact that the underwriters of the dark pool of money that funds the Republican Party -- the oil companies, the big banks, the polluters to name a few -- are shaking in their Gucci loafers over the prospect of someone like Tom joining the Senate and having the power to hold them accountable for putting the interests of the few above the many. They have long viewed Tom as a traitor to his class and are terrified that his joining the fight for the three justices -- environmental, economic and education -- in order to give all Americans a fair shake will upset their ability to keep rigging the system to their benefit,\" said Democratic strategist Chris Lehane., Stutzman is a former advisor to ex-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and 2010 gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman, the former EBay chief who spent $144 million of her own money on her unsuccessful bid., Stutzmans effort would initially be formed as an educational group but would eventually turn into a super PAC, which could accept unlimited donations. It has the potential to draw from a broad base of contributors, including moneyed oil interests angered by Steyers work fighting climate change and fracking, small-dollar conservative donors irked by Steyers multimillion-dollar attempts to sway political contests across the nation in 2014 and supporters of other Democratic candidates in the 2016 California Senate race, such as Atty. Gen. Kamala D. Harris., Steyer, a former hedge-fund manager from the Bay Area who spent more than $74 million of his own money trying to make climate change a top issue and elect Democrats in 2014, has confirmed that he is weighing a Senate bid, but its unclear when he will make a decision., I havent made a decision yet, he said in an interview with The Times published Tuesday. Either way, Ill be working full time to be part of the solution to the problems I care the most about., Steyers wealth would be an enormous advantage in a potential run -- he could easily fund his own campaign in California, an expensive undertaking. However, the states voters have not looked kindly on millionaire/billionaire candidates who have never held elected office and spent large chunks of their fortunes seeking top posts -- see the failed efforts of former business executives including Whitman, Carly Fiorina, Al Checchi and Michael Huffington., Steyer also faces challenges with his business background. He left Farallon Capital Management, the hedge fund he ran, in 2012, saying he wanted to focus his work on alternative energy. As he became increasingly engaged in politics, his business record has come under growing scrutiny., News reports detailed his longtime investments in coal and other fossil fuels, for example, and the slow pace at which he shed some of those investments.

{"Content": "[[, Votes were being tallied in Afghanistan after a presidential runoff election on Saturday that saw scattered violence and a more subdued turnout among women than the first round of balloting two months ago., Reports from the provinces indicated that Taliban insurgents again tried to disrupt voting outside of Afghanistans heavily guarded cities, launching attacks that killed 14 civilians and 10 Afghan security personnel, officials said. A rocket slammed into a home in eastern Laghman province, killing four people, including two children, Afghanistans Tolo news channel reported., The Afghan Interior Ministry recorded 150 security incidents across the country, although most were small-scale attacks such as isolated roadside bombings and mine blasts., In much of Afghanistan, however, voters and officials reported a relatively smooth election day as the country again managed to avoid major chaos in the months-long contest to select President Hamid Karzais successor. Election officials said that turnout was about 7 million, close to that of the first round, although anecdotal reports suggested that fewer women cast ballots because of security concerns., The new president will guide Afghanistan through a crucial transition in which the remaining 32,000 U.S. troops will depart by 2016, leaving the countrys fledgling security forces to battle a weakened but determined Taliban insurgency., Former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah was considered the front-runner based on his strong showing in the first round of voting in April, but ex-Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani was believed to have closed the gap in the final weeks with support from his Pashtun ethnic group, Afghanistans largest. Millions of ballots were being counted by hand, and results werent expected for several weeks., The Afghan people have once again shown their commitment to a peaceful and democratic future for Afghanistan, U.S. Ambassador James B. Cunningham, said in a statement. The Afghan security forces, well prepared and effective, again performed superbly in protecting the elections., Election officials opened more polling sites, deployed more observers and prepared more ballot papers in an attempt to address shortcomings from the first round, in which voting had to be extended in many areas because of long lines and several polling stations running out of ballots., At a polling center at a high school in Istalif, a district north of Kabul, election officials reported lower turnout than in April. Still, enthusiasm was high among those who did line up to cast ballots shortly after polls opened at 7 a.m., Abdul Raof Yaqobi, a bearded 25-year-old, said he came to vote for the future of my country., Yaqobi, a law student, said he was voting for Abdullah, a longtime opposition politician whom he described as a leader among the people. He understands the peoples problems in all over Afghanistan more than anyone else., Abdullah, a vocal Karzai critic who is associated with the Northern Alliance forces that battled the Taliban in the 1990s, won 45% of the vote in the first round compared with 31.6% for Ghani. He secured the endorsements of several top political figures, but Ghani, a technocrat and former World Bank economist, was counting on strong support from his southern Pashtun base., Both men are seen as relative moderates who would patch relations with the United States, which have badly deteriorated in the closing years of Karzais 13-year tenure. Each has pledged to sign a bilateral security pact that would provide for about 9,800 U.S. troops to remain in Afghanistan until 2016 under a plan recently announced by the Obama administration., We are hopeful that whoever wins the elections, he should serve the people, said Qari Noorulhaq, 62, who voted with his wife in Kabul., His wife, Fariba, said she urged him to bring her to vote after she saw people casting their ballots on TV., We voted for our children and we dont want war in this country again, said Fariba, who wore a burqa.

A world-class transportation network. Proximity to large markets. The shore,\" Christie listed., In his hourlong address before lawmakers, Christie hammered on key Republican pillars, chief among them lowering taxes and shrinking the size of government., Christie mentioned the recent departure of a Mercedes-Benz plant to Georgia because that state offered a more alluring tax credit package along with its lower state tax rates., \"Dont take my word for it -- the leaders of Mercedes said it themselves. Economic incentive laws help, but lower taxes are better,\" Christie said, notingthat since he took office hes vetoed four bills that sought to raise taxes., Christie said his administration \"believes today -- and has always believed -- that New Jersey and America will be a better place for middle-class families by shrinking the size of government,\" he said., As chairman of the Republican Governors Assn. last year, Christie received flak from constituents because he was often on the road stumping and raising cash for GOP candidates during the midterm election cycle. More recently, some have criticized Christie for cozying up to Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones; the two were regularly spotted together at football games., Despite his focus on New Jersey, Christie did take aim at Washington, possibly nodding to a potential run for the presidency in 2016., \"During this time of uncertainty it seems our leaders in Washington would rather stoke division for their own political gain,\" Christie said. \"This culture of divisiveness and distrust has seeped into our communities and our neighborhoods.\", Before his address, Christie drew some criticism for holding an off-the-record session with a handful of national news outlets. No local media were allowed at the session, and the Democratic National Committee sent out an email to supporters alleging Christie is not truly focused on New Jersey residents., Last year, Christie was the focus of an investigation into a scheme perpetrated by his aides to snarl traffic leading to the George Washington Bridge. Democrats, who control both chambers of the state Legislature, held hearings that explored whether Christie had any knowledge of the bridge closure. A federal probe of the incident is ongoing., On Tuesday, Christie alluded to the scandal, saying its been \"ayear with plenty of politics from some overly partisan corners of this chamber.\", As speculation continuesto swirl around when he will make an official announcement about his 2016 intentions, Christie went off message from his prepared remarks and offered state lawmakers a peek into his intentions for next year., \"Ill be here in one year,\" he said to tepid applause from the chamber filled mostly with Democrats. \"Ill be here in one year.\", Follow @kurtisaleeand emailkurtis.lee@latimes.com]", "Date": "20150113", "Title": "[Chris Christie touts New Jersey, assails D.C. in State of the State speech]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-chris-christie-state-state-20150113-story.html", "Author": "[Kurtis Lee]"}
{"Content": "[[, WASHINGTON  As the White House looks to wrap up years of negotiations on a highly contested Pacific Rim trade pact, administration officials are increasingly casting the agreement as vital to helping the U.S. face its most daunting economic rival: China., The proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, would be the largest trade deal in American history, involving the U.S., Japan and 10 other countries that combined make up 40% of the world economy. China isnt among them., In recent weeks, one Obama official after another has hammered away at the same line of argument: Its crucial that Congress supports the TPP  including passing a related trade-promotion bill that would strengthen the presidents negotiating hand  because the alternative is that China, not the U.S., will write the rules of global trade., They note that China is trying to cobble together a competing 16-nation trade pact without the United States., \"We want to make sure we dont cede ground to China,\" Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said last month. Added Deputy Commerce Secretary Bruce Andrews: \"Its a choice between us writing it and, frankly, China writing it.\", The administrations focus on China comes at an important juncture for what has become a priority for President Obama this year., Though he didnt launch the decade-old TPP talks, Obama has made the proposed trade deal the centerpiece of his foreign policy in East Asia, where Chinas rising economic and military power is challenging Americas long-held dominant influence in the region. And in that sense, Obamas legacy as the self-proclaimed Pacific president hinges on nailing down the TPP., Yet with less than two years left in his presidency and much less time on the political calendar for passing a trade bill, the administration has been stepping up its campaign for a trade-promotion legislation that many see as a necessary first step to conclude the TPP negotiations., Trade-promotion authority would allow the White House to iron out an agreement with other nations with the assurance that Congress would not make changes to a final deal, only voting it up or down., Obama stands a better chance today of winning so-called fast-track authority than a few months ago, thanks to a stronger domestic economy and a midterm election that put the Senate in the hands of the Republican Party, which is historically more favorable toward trade agreements., Even so, the president needs enough Democratic backing to secure passage, and with strident opposition from corners of his own party, the White House has unleashed a full-court press on trade  with China as a major talking point., \"Theyre trying to reframe the debate and say this is not simply a matter of trade flows  [that] this is about a long-term geopolitical competition between the U.S. and China,\" said Robert J. Shapiro, a Washington consultant and top Clinton administration economic strategist., Opponents of the TPP say that pulling out the China card at this stage represents an act of desperation in the face of persistent congressional uneasiness about Obamas trade agenda., \"They think China is the biggest, scariest story they can tell,\" said Lori Wallach, trade director at Public Citizen, a consumer-rights advocacy group that has been a sharp critic of the TPP. \"Its the best boogeyman for the moment.\", U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman, commenting on the shift in strategy, noted that China was trying to forge its own regionwide trade alliance., \"We have different approaches to how we pursue trade agreements,\" he said at a recent briefing with reporters. \"And as we look ahead, we want to make sure that were using our trade agreements to shape globalization  in a way that supports American workers and American jobs.\", With the TPP, the U.S. wants to reduce tariffs and other barriers to open markets as well as establish standards on a range of issues affecting trade and commerce, such as intellectual property rights, government procurement and state-owned enterprises., Besides the U.S. and Japan, the TPP parties are Canada, Australia, Mexico, Malaysia, Singapore, Chile, Peru, New Zealand, Vietnam and Brunei., The White House has estimated that the trade deal would boost American exports by $123.5 billion a year by 2025. Thats about 6% of the total $2.3 trillion in exports last year., Administration officials, including Vilsack and Secretary of State John F. Kerry, also have said the trade agreement \"would support\" an additional 650,000 jobs in the U.S., Though no one disputes that trade-related jobs pay considerably more than average wages, many analysts doubt that the TPP would have a significant effect on U.S. employment overall. If the deal boosts exports, imports too will rise, putting downward pressure on domestic jobs., Various labor, environmental and health groups, meanwhile, fear the deal would benefit corporations at the expense of workers and ordinary families. Fair minimum wages and access to generic medicines are among areas of concern., Big-business groups are squarely behind the TPP and have ramped up their lobbying efforts for fast-track authority too, also appealing in part to the threat of a rival, 16-country trade deal that China is spearheading. That deal would exclude the U.S. in the same way that the TPP excludes China., \"The Trans-Pacific Partnership is Americas best and only chance to ensure the United States is not stuck on the outside looking in,\" Tami Overby, senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said at a House hearing Wednesday on the TPP., Whether the China argument will influence lawmakers or the public is hard to tell., Surveys show that a strengthening recovery in the U.S. along with Chinas slowing economic growth has made the giant Asian country less of a threat today in the eyes of the American public., On the other hand, a Gallup poll last month found that more Americans than ever, a solid 50%, viewed it as \"important\" for the U.S. to be No. 1 in the world economically., The emphasis on China may appeal to moderate Democrats, said Derek Scissors, a China specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute., \"To this point, trade has pressed wages of the industrial middle class while its paid off for people in technology,\" he said., Given Democratic skepticism, the Obama administration may be reluctant to focus the argument on the merits of trade, Scissors said. \"So you turn it into Its a way to beat China. Politically it makes a lot of sense.\", Rep. Janice Hahn (D-Los Angeles), whose district includes the Port of Los Angeles, isnt buying it., \"I believe that in concept,\" she said of the need for the U.S. to set the rules of global trade. \"Im pro-trade. I understand the economic value of trade.... But I think there are so many questions we have about the actual deal.

{"Content": "[[, WASHINGTON  The Republican-controlled Senate took its first step toward fulfilling a GOP promise to roll back key parts of the sweeping 2010 law that overhauled financial industry regulations and oversight., The Dodd-Frank reform law, designed to prevent a catastrophe similar to the 2008 financial crisis, has been a target of GOP leaders since it was adopted on a largely party line vote by a then-Democratic-controlled Congress., On Thursday, the Senate Banking Committee voted 12 to 10 along party lines to loosen parts of the law that Republicans have argued were too burdensome on small banks and could hurt the economy., Democrats charged that the legislation by the panels chairman, Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), also would help big Wall Street banks and reduce consumer protections, demonstrating that deep partisan divisions over the issue still exist nearly five years after the law was enacted., The chairmans bill is good for giant banks, but its bad for families and its dangerous for the economy, said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)., Shelby and nearly all congressional Republicans opposed the Dodd-Frank bill in 2010, calling it an over-reaction to the crisis that would weigh down financial firms with too much government regulation. Urged by the banking industry, GOP leaders have been eager to make major changes., The House has approved numerous bills watering down key provisions of the law since Republicans took control of that chamber in 2011. But those attempts failed to get through the Democrat-controlled Senate., After Republicans won enough Senate seats in November to gain the majority, the efforts were revived. In December and January, Republican leaders successfully attached provisions watering down some parts of Dodd-Frank to must-pass bills that President Obama signed., And after taking over as Banking Committee chairman this year, Shelby began working on the comprehensive rollback bill., While there is bipartisan consensus that some changes are needed in Dodd-Frank to help community banks avoid burdensome regulations, Republicans and Democrats have split sharply on how to do that., Is Dodd-Frank perfect? Of course not, said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). But we must not undermine the key protections that the law provides to prevent another catastrophe for our economy or for our neighbor who has saved for years to buy a home., Brown and all nine of his Democratic colleagues on the Senate Banking Committee opposed Shelbys 216-page bill., They supported narrower legislation from Brown that the committee voted down Thursday, also on a party-line vote., The White House has said the president opposes Shelbys bill., Still, Shelby said he hopes that a bipartisan compromise can be reached because of general agreement that Dodd-Frank needs some revisions., His bill doesnt go as far as some past House proposals, which notably would overhaul the funding and the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and subject Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions to congressional audits., Shelbys legislation, called the Financial Regulatory Improvement Act, would make many changes. Among them is giving regulators the discretion to ease tough new regulations on financial institutions with $50 billion to $500 billion in assets, a revision that could help large regional banks, such as U.S. Bancorp., Dodd-Frank requires any firm with assets of more than $50 billion to be designated a systemically important financial institution, subjecting it to greater oversight and requirements to hold more capital to cover potential losses., Shelbys bill would make the designation a requirement only for banks with more than $500 billion in assets. Only seven banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc., are that large., The mandatory $50-billion threshold is a blunt instrument, Shelby said., The total assets held by a bank are an important factor, but not the only factor that should be considered when determining whether a bank poses a risk to the entire financial system, he said., The bill also makes numerous changes to help small banks, such as expanding the number that would qualify for less frequent regulatory exams., Shelbys legislation also would ease some new mortgage lending requirements and make changes at the Federal Reserve, such as requiring the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate instead of appointed by the banks board., In addition, the bill would establish a commission to study the Feds structure and submit recommendations to Congress about how to improve it., Frank Keating, president of the American Bankers Assn. trade group, said the legislation would provide much-needed regulatory relief to banks of all sizes., This bill is a significant step toward removing many of the statutory and regulatory barriers that constrain banks ability to serve their customers and meet the needs of their local communities, he said., Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), viewing the Democratic alternative as too narrow, said he hoped for a bipartisan compromise. He acknowledged, though, that a key feature of Shelbys legislation was a problem., I think its going to be incredibly hard to move from the $50-billion to the $500-billion level for mandatory designation as a systemically important financial institution, Corker said., Shelby needs to gain some Democratic support to overcome a potential filibuster. If he could craft a compromise, it probably would be approved by the Republican-controlled House., White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest indicated last week that Shelbys bill as it stands now would not get Obamas signature., Im confident that when it comes to opposing this piece of legislation, the president will be able to work effectively with Sen. Warren and others to stop it, Earnest said., jim.puzzanghera@latimes.com, , , , 6:12 p.m. Updates with additional details, Originally posted at 10:29 a.m.]", "Date": "20150521", "Title": "[Panel moves to weaken Dodd-Frank]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-financial-regulation-shelby-dodd-frank-20150521-story.html", "Author": "[Jim Puzzanghera]"}
{"Content": "[[, WASHINGTON -- The austere Republican budget proposal from Rep. Paul D. Ryan would slash federal spending to pre-Eisenhower levels, but the \"turbo cuts\" on every aspect of government -- except the military -- are still not enough to reach his promise of balancing in a decade., Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, relies on a combination of previously approved Obamacare savings and tax hikes, along with a new way of measuring economic growth, to reach the 10-year goal of ridding the budget of red ink., That approach does not sit well with hard-line budget hawks, and could make Ryans job even more difficult as the House prepares to vote on the budget next week., GOP leaders are confident this fourth annual budget from Ryan, the former vice presidential nominee from Wisconsin, will have enough Republican votes to pass the House -- despite weeks of internal debate over whether it was politically viable to roll out a do-over of his controversial reforms in an election year., \"We think we have an obligation to lead and show how we would do things differently,\" Ryan said Tuesday in a conference call. \"We think its important to show people our vision.\", The vote is essentially nonbinding, because the budget document is merely a statement of principles and does not carry the force of law. President Obamas own budget for fiscal 2015, released earlier this year, similarly comes with no strings attached., But the blueprints serve as defining documents before the midterm election, and Democrats all but thanked Ryan for reviving his signature ideas for changing Medicare, cutting spending and reducing taxes for the wealthy., \"Budgets are about choices and values,\" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. \"House Republicans have chosen to protect tax breaks for the wealthiest rather than create opportunities for middle-class families.\", \"We might as well call it the Koch budget,\" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), referring to David and Charles Koch, the billionaire industrialists who have spent millions to elect Republicans and pursue small-government principles -- a blueprint, Reid said, for a \"modern Kochtopia.\", Ryans budget is again long on vision but short on details, as he leaves many of the specifics to be decided later., For example, the budget fully repeals the Affordable Care Act, but counts $1 trillion in tax revenues and more than $700 billion in savings from Obamacare toward his bottom line., Ryan defended this approach, saying the Obamacare taxes would eventually be done away with because his budget also calls for an overhaul of the tax system., But finding consensus on tax policy, even within the Republican Party, has proved difficult. A sweeping outline from the GOP chairman of the tax committee, Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, landed with a thud this year in the House. This week, Camp announced he would retire at the end of his term., Even more, tax experts have said Ryans quest to push down top individual tax rates to 25% from 39.6% for the wealthiest Americans cannot be done without incurring costs or doing away with tax breaks that would essentially raise taxes on middle-class earners. This was a key debate issue during the 2012 presidential campaign, when Ryan was on the ticket with Mitt Romney., At the same time, Ryan relied for the first time on a new measure of the benefits of deficit reduction that Democrats argued was applied selectively to ensure that his budget would balance., Ryan can afford to lose about 15 Republicans on the vote, and it remains uncertain whether GOP hawks who have pressed for a balanced budget will pan his accounting methods or simply support their partys document as a blueprint. Obamas budget never balanced., Democrats have already panned Ryans effort. Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said the turbo cuts are more than twice as deep as those in the so-called sequester, which both parties backed away from last year as too draconian., Budget office record-keeping, the congressman added, does not appear to go back far enough to show a time before the Dwight Eisenhower administration when funding for education, roads, healthcare and the rest of the governments nondefense was proportionately as low., lisa.mascaro@latimes.com, Twitter: @lisamascaroinDC]", "Date": "20140401", "Title": "[Paul Ryan budget cuts deeply -- but will it balance as promised?]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-paul-ryan-budget-20140401-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, Watching Carly Fiorina shine in the Republican debate, I began thinking she should forget the presidency and run again in California for the U.S. Senate., No way does she get elected president or even veep. Americans are going to insist on at least some experience  some track record  in public office., The last political rookie elected president was Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had just smashed Hitler and saved the free world. In the 1800s, three other generals rose to commander in chief. Only one vice president  Chester Arthur, a New York Republican chairman  never before held public office., But Fiorina, with her growing popularity and name ID, could be a savior for the crippled California GOP  just the strong candidate it needs to regain relevancy in this deep blue state., SIGN UP for the free Essential Politics newsletter >>, Then I kept on thinking. Foolish me. The odds on any Republican  especially a social conservative like her  winning a statewide race in California are practically zilch., Moreover, Fiorina doesnt even live here anymore. She has moved to Northern Virginia., Too bad for the California Republican Party. A good one got away., But who knows? Fiorina could play out her White House bid and see where it leads. If its to a dead end, the California filing deadline for a Senate candidacy is not until March 16. More than half the states will have voted in caucus or primaries by then. And she could reclaim her California residency., Fiorina ran for the Senate in 2010 against Democratic incumbent Barbara Boxer and didnt come close, losing by 10 points. But Boxer is retiring, presumably making the 2016 race more competitive., Last time, besides being burdened by the Republican label, Fiorina started out slowly because of two personal weights: She underwent breast cancer surgery, followed by hair-losing chemotherapy and radiation. And a stepdaughter who had struggled with alcoholism and drug abuse died., During the campaign, Boxer attacked Fiorinas rocky record as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard. She laid off more than 30,000 workers and shipped jobs overseas as HPs stock tumbled. Fiorina was fired., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, None of that history would disappear if she ran again in California, but itd be old news., \"In 2010, Carly was defined by Barbara Boxer. This year, she has already defined herself,\" says Republican consultant Ray McNally, who with partner Richard Temple ran moderate Tom Campbells losing campaign against Fiorina for the party nomination., \"If she were to drop out of the presidential race, shed be a formidable candidate in California,\" Temple says. \"But shed have to leave on an up note, which they never do.\", Fiorinas 2010 campaign strategist, Marty Wilson, says that \"shes smart, very glib and knows these issues cold. There arent many got ya questions you can throw at her.\", She learned the issues, Wilson says, while advising Republican presidential nominee John McCain in 2008., Fiorina definitely has brought her \"A\" game to the presidential race and scored big during the debate last week. She was impressive  agile and articulate  whether you agreed with her or not., Once was when she spoke from the heart in answering a question about legalizing so-called recreational use of marijuana., Noting she had \"buried a child to drug addiction,\" Fiorina called for more treatment and criminal justice reform. But she added: \"We are misleading young people when we tell them that marijuana is just like having a beer. Its not. And the marijuana that kids are smoking today is not the same as the marijuana Jeb Bush [admittedly] smoked 40 years ago., \"We need to tell young people the truth. Drug addiction is an epidemic.\", Another star moment for Fiorina  although apparently exaggerating  was when she dramatically criticized Planned Parenthood, spacing her words for emphasis: \"I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama to watch these tapes. Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.\", Great performance, but Planned Parenthood said she fabricated. That scene was not part of the undercover videos recently released by anti-abortion crusaders, the organization said, and the fetus was stillborn., Fiorinas highlight moment was in responding to Donald Trumps previous sarcastic remark that her face was a turn-off and nonpresidential. But to fully appreciate the reply, her retort must be seen in full context., Interested in the stories shaping California? Sign up for the free Essential California newsletter >>, Trump had just attacked Bush for denying he had suggested too much tax money was being spent on womens health. \"I heard when he said [it],\" Trump insisted., When Fiorina next was asked about Trumps face slam and his later claim of being misinterpreted, she didnt miss a beat: \"You know, its interesting to me, Mr. Trump said that he heard Mr. Bush very clearly.... I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.\", Bulls-eye., Former California Republican Chairman George \"Duf\" Sundheim, the most promising GOP contender for Boxers seat next year  but still a distant long shot  told me he probably would not have run if Fiorina had., She didnt and she wont be, say insiders., \"That ship has left the port,\" says veteran GOP strategist Ken Khachigian, who has been advising Fiorina., If her star keeps rising, Fiorina could wind up in a Republican presidents cabinet., She could also run for governor or the Senate in her new home state. There, Fiorina is a better political fit anyway than in California., george.skelton@latimes.com, Follow @LATimesSkelton, MORE FROM SKELTON:, Labor needs to stop using environmental law to kill jobs, Reagan would be amused and troubled by this GOP field, The time is ripe for a tax on oil extraction to pay for California road repairs]", "Date": "20150921", "Title": "[State GOP lost an asset when Fiorina left]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-cap-20150921-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, We treat political campaigns like slow-moving athletic competitions and like to pretend that every last gaffe could determine the next president of the United States. But most of us also know, at some level, that forces beyond strategy and personality decide national elections., Since 1978, based on data going back to 1916, Ive documented how four conditions affect voting patterns., The first is whether the president is running again. If so, this has a positive effect on votes for the president. The second is how long a party has controlled the White House. Voters like change; when a party has been in power for two or more consecutive terms, this has a negative effect on votes for that partys candidate. The third is the slight but persistent bias in favor of the Republican Party., Finally, the state of the economy: A good economy at the time of the election has a positive effect on votes for the incumbent party candidate. The economic variables that matter are the rate of inflation and output (GDP) growth. Of particular importance is GDP growth in the first three quarters of the election year., These first three conditions are working against the Democrats in 2016. The president is not running; the Democrats have been in power for two terms; there is that lingering Republican bias. According to the equation behind my work, then, the economy has to be very strong between now and the election for the Democrats to have a good chance of winning., Most economists believe the economy will grow at about a 3% annual rate between now and November 2016. If that happens, my equation predicts the Democrats will win about 46% of the vote in a two-party contest. In order for them to win more than 50%, the economy would need to grow at about 4%, and even in that case their predicted vote share would climb only slightly above the halfway mark., My equations average prediction error over the 25 elections since 1916 is between 2.5 and 3.5 percentage points. Assuming the economy does indeed grow at 3%, the probability that the Democrats will win is low, between about 5% and 13%. Republicans have cause for confidence., My analysis is, of course, based on the assumption that the future will be like the past. What if voters start caring more about income inequality than economic growth, and perceive the Republicans to be poor on that issue? Or what if the GOP nominates someone further from the mainstream than ever before?, Shifts in priorities can never be ruled out, but the best I can say is that the conditions that sway voters appear to have been fairly stable for 100 years  and my equation has a fairly good track record., In seven of the nine contests between 1980 and 2012, my equation correctly predicted which party would win the popular vote. It was wrong in 1992, when it predicted that Clinton would lose. (There was a strong third-party candidate that year, Ross Perot, which may have been a problem.) And it was wrong in 2012, when it predicted President Obama would win only 49% of the vote and he got 52%. All along, however, I said the prediction fell within the margin of error., A prediction of the sort I have just made is different from predictions using polls. Although polls can at times be fairly accurate, at least near the time of the election, they are not causal. The theory behind my analysis is that the economy and the other conditions have a causal effect on voting behavior., Given an economic forecast, I can make a prediction at any time  I dont even need to know whos running. I made my first prediction for the 2016 election in November, at which time I predicted, as now, that the Republicans would win if the economy turned out as currently expected., If a more robust economy does not materialize, it is likely that after 18 months of essentially nonstop campaigning, the Democratic nominee will lose  through no fault of her own., Ray C.

{"Content": "[[, Weighing in on behalf of a trio of Colorado Democrats locked in fierce midterm contests, Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday implored party loyalists to get out the vote in an election for which ballots have already arrived in mailboxes across the state., We need votes for people who believe in you, who worry about you and do everything in their power to give you and your families opportunities, Clinton told Democrats crammed into a hotel ballroomin the suburbs east of Denver. Dig deep, knock on every door, talk to every person, tell them to vote., Clinton arrived here Tuesday intent on appealing to suburban women, a crucial voting bloc in statewide elections in Colorado. Sen. Mark Udall and Gov. John Hickenlooper, the Democratic incumbents, face competitive opponents and, like Democrats nationwide, have been dragged downby a president whose approval ratings in the state hover near 40%. A third Democrat, Andrew Romanoff, is battling for a congressional seat in Aurora., The relative unpopularity of President Obama has left Clinton and her husband, former Bill Clinton, at the forefront of stand-ins seeking to rev up Democratic turnout before Novembers election., At various junctures of her speech, the former secretary of State and possible 2016 presidential candidatewove together hallmark Democratic talking points such as strengthening the middle class, pay equity for women, abortion rights and approval of same-sex marriage., Each of the themes has been touched on by Clinton in recent weeks as shes deliveredspeeches on behalf of Democrats, including Tom Wolf, Pennsylvanias gubernatorial nominee, and Alison Lundergan Grimes, who is locked in a tight race with Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky., This election is important to everybody, but especially important to the women of Colorado, she said to rousing applause., She added that if womens rights are rolled back anywhere, its a threat to them everywhere., Though she didnt mention Udalls opponent, Rep. Cory Gardner, by name, Clinton criticized what she indicated has been a vacillation by the Republican on issues important to women., These Democrats will never support so-called personhood laws that would outlaw common forms of birth control  they wont tell the voters of Colorado one thing about personhood and telltheir colleagues in the House of Representatives the exact opposite., Coloradans, who will vote this year by mail, have been bombarded by campaign TV ads, with social issues dominating the discourse., From personhood to birth control and abortion, Democrats have attacked Gardner as extreme when it comes to womens reproductive rights - an effort to appeal to women in suburbs like Arapahoe County, where Tuesdays rally was held., The stakes could not be higher, Udall said at the rally. Theres a clear contrast between the vision of all of us in this room who want to keep Colorado moving forward and that of Congressman Gardners, which is a radical agenda that will move us backward.\", Gardner this year renounced his past support for unsuccessful efforts to pass personhood measures, which would have given a fertilized egg the same rights as a person. In a clear play for support from female voters, Gardner on the campaign trail has supported over-the-counter birth control for women., For the most part, Gardner has sought to make the race less about social issues and more about Udall and Obama. Likemost Republicans nationwide, Gardner has castigated Udall for his support of the Affordable Care Act and has highlighted the fact that hundreds of thousands of Coloradans lost their healthcare plans because of Obamacares requirements., Four years ago, Sen. Michael Bennet, who now serves as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, captured female voters by double-digits over Republican Ken Buck, according toexit polls.He hammered Buck relentlessly on social issues, calling him extreme when it came to birth control and abortion rights - creating a template for Udalls campaign against Gardner., Reproductive issues are important, Melissa Walker, 22, said beforethe rally., Walker made the short drive from Denver to hear Clinton speakand said she was concerned that all of the talk about womens rights might turn off some voters., Its all you hear, birth control this, birth control that. I hope it doesnt turn off some women voters and they dont show up, Walker said., In her speech, Clinton seemed to try to answer Walkers concerns, saying discussion of womens rights in the Senate campaign is necessary., When we talk about womens rights it gets to the heart of who we are as a people, she said., Clintons visit was part of a statewide bus tour through election day for Udall. First Lady Michelle Obama is scheduled to join the tour Thursday, appearing in Denver and the college town of Fort Collins - all in an effort to boost turnout among women and young people., Later this week, Clinton will travel to Massachusetts to campaign for gubernatorial hopeful Martha Coakley and speak in North Carolina for a get-out-the-vote rally with Sen.

{"Content": "[[, Weighing President Obamas request for billions of dollars in new funding to combat the Ebola virus, lawmakers on Wednesday pressed federal agencies to explain how the additional money would help in the fight against the disease., Members of the Senate Appropriations Committee debated Obamas request for $6.18 billion in additional funds to battle the virus, which has infected more than 13,000 people, mostly in West Africa but also in a handful of cases in the United States and Europe., Ebola, in my mind, meets the criteria for emergency spending, said committee Chairwoman Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.). Its sudden. Its urgent. Its unforeseen. And its temporary., But the request faced skeptical lawmakers who questioned whether additional money would be well spent by a federal government that has struggled at times with containing the epidemic., Instead of an effective response, what weve witnessed from various agencies is confusing and at times contradictory plans, Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) said., Senators challenged officials over their sometimes disorganized initial response to the Ebola outbreak in the United States, including an evolving federal policy on quarantine and treatment. Shelby questioned how often officials speak with Ron Klain, the Ebola \";czar named by Obama to coordinate the federal response., Ive been in touch every day with Mr. Klain, said Sylvia Mathews Burwell, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. She said Klains efforts had helped shape policy across the government during the outbreak., The presidents funding request would be broken into two parts, with $4.64 billion going toward immediate relief efforts in Africa and to better prepare U.S. hospitals. The remaining $1.54 billion would be retained for funding needs in the future., More than $3 billion would go to the Department of Health and Human Services to support interventions in West Africa and to ensure each U.S. state has a designated Ebola treatment center and protective equipment. Another $2 billion would go to the State Department and USAID to support efforts in Africa, with $112 million in additional funds going to support military-led response efforts in the region., Agency leaders testified that the additional funding would enable a final campaign to eradicate the virus in Africa and fund hundreds of treatment centers in the three affected countries., Stopping the disease at its source in West Africa - that, in turn, will protect the homeland, Burwellsaid. She highlighted additional cases discovered this week in Mali as evidence that the outbreak remains virulent., Funding would also go toward ongoing public health efforts worldwide and investments in vaccines and medical research, and for training of domestic healthcare workers in infection control, officials said., Officials emphasized that despite public fear over the disease, future cases of the virus can be contained within the United States through monitoring of suspected patients, including returning healthcare workers., \";We certainly understand peoples concerns. Ebola is scary; its deadly.... But Ebola spreads from direct contact with someone who is sick with Ebola, said Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He said the 21-day monitoring regime currently in place had been effective in tracking healthcare workers returning from West Africa and would continue., Frieden defended his agency over lawmakers criticisms that officials allowed a nurse who treated the nations first Ebola patient to travel on a commercial airline. They noted that the military had instituted a mandatory quarantine for troops returning from Africa while the CDC had not done the same for its workers., The guidance we provided was based on decades of experience in Africa. When it did not work here, we changed that guidance, he said. We will change our guidance based on experience and what the science and data show us., The Senate hearing came as panic over the disease in the United States has begun to wane, with the countrys last known patient being declared free of the disease. Dr. Craig Spencer, a Doctors Without Borders volunteer who treated Ebola patients in Guinea, officially recovered from the virus in New York on Tuesday. Only one patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian who traveled to Dallas, has so far died of the disease in the United States., The CDC expanded its efforts after Duncans death, making improvements to the safety gear healthcare workers wear while treating patients and establishing a quick-response team to assist at hospitals dealing with Ebola cases., Engineers with the Defense Department also opened a field hospital in Liberias capital Monrovia on Monday, staffed by more than 60 public health workers. The hospital is part of the existing $30-million effort to upgrade the West African nations degraded healthcare infrastructure and slow the spread of the disease.

Both events are especially timely in light of recent security breaches, including one at UCLA Health System that affected 4.5 million patients. The conferences will draw thousands of tech and cybersecurity professionals from businesses and government, as well as shadowy, anonymous sorts with a particular set of skills., DreamWorks earnings: DreamWorks Animation, the studio behind kids favorites \"Kung Fu Panda\" and \"How to Train Your Dragon,\" will release second-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters have estimated a loss of 28 cents a share for the company, which recently sold its headquarters in Glendale as part of a series of cost-cutting measures. DreamWorks shed 500 jobs earlier this year and installed new management following several box-office flops., Uber lawsuit: A federal judge in San Francisco will determine on Thursday whether a lawsuit filed by former Uber drivers qualifies for class-action status. The lawsuit alleges that the ride-sharing company misclassified drivers as independent contractors when they should have been classified as employees and reimbursed for expenses, including gas. Uber says the plaintiffs who filed the lawsuit arent representative of most Uber drivers and that the 160,000 drivers in California have \"little or nothing in common.\", GOP debate: Ten Republican presidential candidates will take the stage in Cleveland on Thursday for the first prime-time primary debate of the 2016 election cycle. The event, hosted by Fox News and Facebook, will offer (hopefully) a substantial glimpse at how each candidate would boost economic growth and address big-ticket financial issues such as Social Security and Medicare. Job creation likely will be a dominant theme, although it remains to be seen what concrete steps either Republicans or Democrats would take to put more people to work., Jobs numbers: The U.S. Labor Department will release jobs numbers for July on Friday. Economists will be looking once again for signs of a boost in wages for American workers. The U.S. labor market added a healthy 223,000 jobs in June, but many experts were disappointed that average hourly earnings remained flat -- even as the unemployment rate fell to 5.3%, the lowest level in seven years. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of total economic activity, so higher earnings likely equates with growth., TodaysBusiness section focuses on the California Public Employees Retirement System, or CalPERS, which is finally about to reveal how much it pays Wall Street for its most rarefied services. At issue are the performance bonuses, known as carried interest, that for decades have been snatched up by Wall Street giants as part of their compensation. All pension funds are going to be embarrassed when they have to reveal just how much they are actually paying private equity in performance fees, says one economist., Here are some of the other stories that ran in the Times Business section in recent days that were continuing to follow:, Relativity bankruptcy: Beverly Hills-based movie studio Relativity Media has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. This is quite a comedown for entertainment entrepreneur Ryan Kavanaugh, the financial whiz who piloted his own helicopter and sought to rewrite the Hollywood rules of engagement. The high-flying, hard-living mini-mogul, unable to make payment on $320 million owed to lenders, has laid off staff and is preparing to auction off his studio. Relativity was behind movies such as \"The Social Network\" and \"The Fighter.\" Relativity will continue to operate as it restructures its finances., Whole Foods: The first test for Whole Foods Market Inc.s newvalue-oriented stores will be in one of the nations most competitive grocery landscapes. The Texas-based chain said the first of its new 365 by Whole Foods Marketstores will open next year in Silver Lake, setting up a potential showdown with rival Trader Joes. The former site of a Ralphs was originally intended for a regular Whole Foods, but the company decided to renegotiate the lease to expedite the new stores opening. The store will be about 30,000 square feet and may have a wine bar., Film credits: The California Film Commission said 254 projects had applied for the second round of the states newly expanded film and television tax credit, underscoring strong demand for incentives intended to keep production in California. Between July 13 and July 25, the film commission said it received 32 applications for studio films and 222 for independent features projects. Due to limited funds, however, only a fraction of the applicants will be selected. The $55.2-million round includes $48.3 million for studio feature films, and $6.9 million for independent projects., Full-service investing: Mike Jones is chief executive and co-founder of Science Inc., a mash-up of venture capitalism, angel investing and business incubation. He calls his Santa Monica firm, founded in 2011, a \"start-up studio\" that distinguishes itself by investing more than money in young companies. Science Inc. fields fleets of experts in every aspect of operations  fundraising, marketing, app development, advertising, accounting  to hand-hold promising endeavors to profitability. The most successful start-up so far: Dollar Shave Club, an online retailer of mens grooming products that received $100,000 from Science in 2012. It had $65 million in sales in 2014., A slick company: Never mind smartphones, biotechnology and streaming video. If you wanted to handily beat the stock market over the last decade, you should have bought WD-40 Co. As CEO Garry Ridge tells it, the San Diego maker of the decidedly unglamorous WD-40 lubricant, rust protector and squeak eliminator keeps growing steadily, notably in foreign markets. And its stock keeps rising in lockstep with its sales. While the benchmark Standard & Poors 500 index has gained about 70% in the last 10 years, WD-40s stock is up more than 200%. Sales totaled $383 million in its fiscal year ended in August., And some recent stories from other publications that caught our eye:, Trumps wealth: Bloomberg News crunches the latest numbers on Donald Trumps wealth, and the figure it comes up with is $2.9 billion. The celebrity presidential candidate says hes worth more than $10 billion. The majority of Trumps fortune is derived from real-estate holdings such as resorts and office buildings. Other properties include Turnberry in Scotland and Doonbeg in Ireland, both golf courses., Rent to own: The Wall Street Journal says investors have found a new way to profit from consumers with blemished credit who cant qualify for a mortgage: let them rent a home first with the option to buy later. Rent-to-own programs were popular with cash-strapped consumers during the 1990s, but faded away when easy lending made it possible for almost anyone to buy a home with no money down., Cash is king: What makes for a great entrepreneur? Quartz says one trait shared by successful go-getters is ready access to cash  family money, an inheritance, or a pedigree and connections that allow for financial stability.

{"Content": "[[, Welcome to the Friday edition of Essential Politics, in which we take a look at the stories that go beyond the daily headlines to provide a deeper insight into the race for president. Im David Lauter, Washington Bureau chief and your Friday host., Wednesday nightsRepublican presidential debate left the partys primary campaign deeply unsettled. It also did nothing to resolve one of the fundamental, underlying issues facing the GOP: Should Republicans try to bring the nations fast-growing Latino population into their camp, as the partys official post-mortem on the 2012 election urged, or should they put all their chips on getting conservative white voters to the polls? Thats an issue in several well-known swing states, but as Kate Linthicum reports from South Carolina, the question also looms, not far off, in other states whose Latino populations are small, but growing fast., And speaking of minority voters, for all the discussion of the declining share of the electorate that is white, Linthicum also detailed the important flip side of the story: Latinos and Asian Americans are nowhere near matching the voting rate of whites and African Americans. As a result, the U.S. voting population is less representative of the countrys racial diversity than it was in the 1950s., In a related matter, for all the political talk about \"anchor babies,\" thenumber of children born in the U.S. to non-citizen mothers is actually on the decline., Politics is not just about demographics, of course. Candidates with their individual strengths and weaknesses matter. Right now, its Carly Fiorinas turn in the spotlight. Seema Mehta, who covered Fiorinas unsuccessful campaign for the Senate in 2010, teamed up with Mark Z. Barabak for aclose look at how Fiorina is trying to capitalize on the attention and the hurdles in her way., In addition to the personalities and quirks of the candidates, campaigns also are influenced by staff. Evan Halper brings us the intriguing story of a pair of sisters, Kristina and Kori Schake, who grew up in Sonoma County and have become major figures in presidential politics, one for the Democrats and the other for Republicans. They reflect on the role that their California background brings to their politics., And then there is money, which former California Assembly Speaker Jesse M. Unruh famously referred to as the \"mothers milk of politics.\" Both parties have long mined California for campaign cash. But this year, the Republican race features asurprising twist on where the money comes from. Michael Finnegan, Melanie Mason and our data team, led by Ben Welsh, explain how., As their story notes, tech industry multimillionaires have become significant sources of money for politicians on both sides of the political divide. But that doesnt mean that Silicon Valley has gone gaga for the presidential candidates. Quite the contrary, as Halper found, thepervasive sense in the valley remains that none of the candidates quite understands what they do or are in sync with the industrys values., Finally, dont forget data: Our Los Angeles Times/USC Dornsife Poll remains the essential resource for understanding how the presidential campaign is being viewed by the states voters. And no one explains the poll findings better than Cathleen Decker., What were reading, One thing we aim to do with this Friday newsletter, in addition to pulling together our own most insightful work, is to highlight a couple of pieces published elsewhere that merit special attention., Here are a pair that demonstrate two very different ways to write about a political campaign, both excellent:, Washington Post reporter David A. Farenthold took a detailed, closely reported look at the life of an also-ran, the often frustrating, sometimes humiliating search for votes when nothing quite seems to be working. He focused his attention on former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum as he seeks to hit all 99 of Iowas counties, in a so-far futile effort to recapture the magic that pushed him to victory in the Iowa caucuses in 2012., While Farentholds style is description, Ron Brownstein has perfected the art of political analysis. Heres Brownsteins close look at theGOP searching for direction as it confronts the changing demographics of the United States., Thats all for this week. On Monday, my colleagueChristina Bellantoni will be back with the daily newsletter.

{"Content": "[[, What ever happened to the messiah? He for whom Americans danced in the streets on that unforgettable election night just six years ago. He who promised that humankind would remember this moment \"when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.\", As we approach the midterm congressional elections, Democratic candidates dont want to be seen with President Obama, his approval rating is around 40%, and in Europe he has gone from \"Obama! Obama!\" to \"No-dramaObama\" to \"Nobama.\", What went wrong? Or is this new low just as unrealistic as the original high? Obviously, much can still happen in the more than two years left to the president, but, gray-haired now, detached, wearily lecturing, he increasingly sounds as if he would rather be on the golf course., Its important to recall that no president since 1945 has been dealt such a difficult hand  the worst financial crisis since the 1930s; the legacy of George W. Bushs disastrous, unnecessary war in Iraq; a dysfunctional political system that snarls around a gerrymandered, polarized and money-dominated Congress; and a millennial shift in the global balance of power. This year China has overtaken the United States as the worlds largest economy, based on the International Monetary Funds reckoning of purchasing power., All this being said, what is the interim balance sheet? My answer: moderately good in domestic policy, very poor in foreign policy., The U.S. economy is doing better than that of any other major developed country. It has grown nearly 8% since the first quarter of 2008, while the Eurozones is still more than 2% down over the same period. Unemployment has fallen below 6%. The federal budget deficit for fiscal 2014 was under 3% of GDP (the Eurozones notional limit)., We can argue till the cows come home about who should get the credit for this  the administration, former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, shale gas, the dynamism of a huge domestic market, the native entrepreneurial spirit of the American people, God Almighty  but it happened on Obamas watch. The Dodd-Frank restraints on the financial sector are timid and incomplete, but his Consumer Financial Protection Bureau offers significant new protection for those on the wrong side of the bankers desk. He has done what he can to start reducing carbon emissions, despite a lobby-dominated Congress., The initial rollout of the Obamacare website was a managerial disaster, for which he bears responsibility, but the Affordable Care Act has already brought perhaps 10 million people into insured healthcare or Medicaid for the first time. Two Princeton scholars found that in his first term Obama quietly budgeted far more for means-tested anti-poverty programs than other Democratic presidents. He talked less about the poor but did more for them. He hasnt (yet) done comprehensive immigration reform, but thats mainly because Republican politicians are putting their reelection this year before the partys long-term interest in winning over Latino voters., This is a respectable domestic record for hard times. In foreign policy, by contrast, the president has delivered so little. He hasnt \"done stupid stuff\" like invading Iraq. But thats about it., The visionary statesman of the 2009 Cairo speech failed to seize the opportunity of the \"Arab Spring,\" especially in Egypt, where well over $1 billion in aid would have given the U.S. real leverage with Egypts again dominant, repressive military. He declared a \"red line\" on the use of chemical weapons in Syria, and let President Bashar Assad cross it with impunity. Assad next concentrated his fire on the moderate Syrian opposition, which Hillary Clinton had urged Obama to support more vigorously. This let what is now Islamic State gain a stronger foothold. Meanwhile, his weakness in dealing with the Shiite Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki  weakness criticized in a recent memoir by his own former Defense secretary Leon Panetta  turned some discontented Sunnis toward Islamic State. And now Americans are again militarily engaged in Iraq., The premature Nobel Peace Prize winner has not (yet) pulled out all the stops to achieve a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, as Bill Clinton did. He has been weak in responding to Russian President Vladimir Putins shameless aggression in Ukraine. The scandal of mass electronic surveillance by the National Security Agency has alienated crucial allies, especially the Germans, and Obama did not even fire his top intelligence official, James Clapper, who lied about it to Congress., The pivot to Asia is a good idea, but neither China nor U.S. allies in the region have been impressed by the results. Then theres development aid. Despite priorities he set, Obama has done little more for U.S. development aid to the global South than George W. Bush did with the Millennium Challenge and other initiatives. Oh, and he hasnt closed Guantanamo. Need I go on?, All this leads to an interesting question: Did American voters in Democratic presidential primaries in 2008 put their historic firsts in the wrong order? Should it have been first woman before first African American? Clinton had more experience and would probably have been tougher as president. She was the right age then, whereas she will be 69 if she wins in 2016. Eight years on, after more time in the Senate perhaps followed by a stint as secretary of State or vice president, Obama would have been better equipped to face the challenges of a dangerous world.

{"Content": "[[, What was supposed to be a no-drama final session of Congress before the campaign season turned into anything but as President Obamas new strategy to combat the threat fromIslamic State resulted in a wrenching vote that is likely to reverberate through the midterm election and beyond., The intense foreign policy discussion of the last two weeks forced a pivotal vote -- whether or not the U.S. should arm and train moderate Syrian rebels -- that could define lawmakers for years to come. For most, it was the hardest vote theyd ever taken on a military strategy., On Friday, Obama signed the resolution, which was included in a broader funding bill to keep the government running into December. , Heres what the September session may have told us about the state of the two parties heading into the midterm debate., 1. Senate candidates from both parties sided with the president , The key fight in the 2014 midterms is the battle for control of the Senate. And all but one of the most endangered Democratic incumbents voted in favor of Obamas request to arm the Syrian rebels. , Sen. Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Sen. Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire  all of whom have emphasized veterans issues -- voted yes, as did Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado, a critic of the administrations intelligence-gathering techniques. , Perhaps as interesting was that their Republican challengers largely agreed with the incumbent senators. Udall, Pryor and Landrieu face Republicans currently serving in the House, and all of them -- Reps. Cory Gardnerof Colorado, Tom Cottonof Arkansas and Bill Cassidyof Louisiana --- supported the White Houses request to arm Syrian rebels., Reps. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) and Gary Peters (D-Mich.), both running in close races for open Senate seats, also voted for it., The exception was Democratic Sen. Mark Begich of Alaska, who cast his opposition as a rebuke of the president and his own party, particularly because the measure was attached to a must-pass spending bill. He wanted a separate debate. , In deep-red Alaska, such distancing from the national Democratic Party may help. But his Republican opponent said he would have supported the measure., The scuttling of typical partisan lines on an issue as weighty as war may make the topic less potent on the campaign trail, particularly in the conservative battleground states where voters may lean toward a tougher military stance., If military operations proceed well in the Mideast, those who voted in favor of the presidents strategy could benefit from the afterglow. Polls have shown the public largely supports Obamas new strategy. But if conditions in Syria and Iraq worsen in the fight against Islamic State, criticisms could mount that more  or different  actions should have been taken., 2. This years vote could ripple years later for lawmakers, In the House, the vote on Obamas request for authority to train and equip Syrian opposition fighters passed by a wide majority, 273-156, though not the overwhelming result the White House may have expected., Both opposition to and support for the amendment was bipartisan  and more Republicans than Democrats backed the effort. , Control of the House is favored to stay with Republicans this November. But as lawmakers learned in 2006, when antiwar sentiment contributed to the Democratic sweep, old votes can resonate years later. Many Republicans who supported the 2002 authorization for the war in Iraq lost reelection that year., By and large, candidates in this years toughest races decided the safe vote was yes. Of 14 House incumbents running in races described as toss-up by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, 12 voted yes. The only dissenting votes came from Democratic members whose political careers are rooted in antiwar activism: Carol Shea-Porter of New Hampshire, whose 2006 upset victory epitomized the rejection of President Bushs handling of the Iraq war, and Rick Nolan of Minnesota, who first came to Congress in the Vietnam War era., Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who served as the House Democrats campaign committee chairman in 2008 and 2010, said, \"This is one of those votes when you come to Congress that you want to make sure youve made the best decision that you can for the country.\", 3. With a 2016 White House run in mind, Republican senators showcased the party divide , Among Republicans considered possible presidential material in 2016, the different approaches to the Syrian question represented the broader divide between the GOPs traditional hawkish wing and its newly ascendant anti-interventionists., Conservative Sen. Rand Paulof Kentucky and Sen. Ted Cruzof Texas both declined to back Obamas approach, questioning the wisdom of a strategy that relies on arming Syrians whose allegiances may be difficult to discern., But Paul went to great lengths, in a nearly hourlong floor speech that echoed his recent \"I am not an isolationist\" headline in Time.com, to assert that he is not against all wars. Put another way, he opposes only what Obama once called \"dumb wars.\", \"There are valid reasons to go to war,\" Paul said, noting that he supported the 2001 authorization for war in Afghanistan. \"America should only go to war to win. ... War should occur only when America is attacked, when it is threatened or when our American interests are threatened or attacked.\", Taking a more traditionally hawkish role, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said the mistake would be not acting while the U.S. could play a role to stop the Islamic State., Also voting against Obamas approach were Democratic Party outliers who are liberal favorites for possible presidential runs., Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has said she is not running for president, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats, both voted no, as did rising Democratic star, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrandof New York  who holds the seat Hillary Rodham Clinton held for eight years before becoming secretary of State., Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), another ambitious Democrat who has made visits to early nominating states, voted to support Obamas plan., For Democrats, it was Obamas vote against the war in Iraq in 2002 as a young senator that helped make him a standout in the race against Clinton, who had voted for authorizing the action. , 4. A midterm election wild card? , As much as Democratic and Republican party leaders closed ranks in support of the presidents request, both also seemed eager to turn the attention back to preferred campaign themes  jobs and the economy., House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) delivered what was billed as a major address offering a \"five point\" blueprint for his partys congressional majority going forward, focused on lowering taxes, stopping onerous business regulations and other business- and pocketbook-friendly initiatives., House Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) closed the session by highlighting the Democrats \"Fair Shot Agenda,\" which calls for boosting the minimum wage, lowering the cost of college and supporting equal pay for women. , But try as they might, both leaders found their message drowned out by the end-of-session vote, at least for now  especially as rank-and-file lawmakers from both parties pressured them to hold a broader debate on military authorization for Obamas actions when they return after the election. , The extent to which events in the Middle East continue to dominate the news lends uncertainty in an already turbulent November election, in which control of Congress will be decided., For the latest from Congress follow @LisaMascaroinDC and @MikeMemoli, ]", "Date": "20140919", "Title": "[Four takeaways from the vote in Congress to arm Syrian rebels]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-takeaways-congress-syria-20140919-story.html", "Author": "[Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, When activists from the Black Lives Matter movement arrived at a campaign rally for Hillary Rodham Clinton last month with plans to disrupt the event, they were blocked at the door by Secret Service agents and herded into an overflow room. No room, they were told., A noisy spectacle was averted, but the news spread quickly on social media, and Clinton staffers had to scramble., The Democratic presidential front-runner agreed to meet privately with the protesters, who wanted to challenge her on  among other racially charged issues  her past support for tough sentencing measures that they argued had resulted in unduly long periods of incarceration for black men., \"What in your heart has changed, that is going to change the direction of this country?\" one activist wanted to know., \"There has to be a reckoning, I agree with that,\" Clinton replied, according to a video of the closed-door encounter. She pointed to work she has done to improve the lives of minority children. \"But I think there also has to be some positive vision and plan that you can move people toward,\" she said., The confrontation  public or not  may have produced results. A week later, facing an audience of mainly African Americans at a town hall in North Las Vegas, Clinton changed her standard stump speech to include several points about blacks and the criminal justice system  heading off potential protests before anyone had a chance to stand up and shout., Raucous demonstrators have always been part of the theater of presidential electioneering, but as the 2016 campaign gets underway, the turbulent protests over social justice, police violence and immigration reform that have sent citizens into the streets across America over the last year are becoming increasingly visible on the campaign trail., Candidates are finding themselves being shouted down at events as seemingly innocuous as announcement speeches  often facing protesters not from another political camp, but from groups that might be seen as their allies., U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who is arguably the most liberal of any in the field so far, has been targeted a handful of times by Black Lives Matter protesters  at one point having to exit the stage and abandon an event in what should have been friendly territory in Seattle., Jeb Bush was 20 minutes into his presidential campaign kickoff speech at Miami Dade College in June when a group of protesters stood, unveiled neon green T-shirts spelling out \"Legal status is not enough,\" and began shouting., The interruption, a rebuke of Bushs refusal to support citizenship for the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally, caused the Republican candidate to pause and look at the rafters., \"So that our friends know,\" he said finally, his voice rising, \"the next president of the United States will pass meaningful immigration reforms.\", Bush, whose campaign has boasted that he will go anywhere and speak to anyone, was later shouted down by activists at a Nevada town hall in the same area where Clinton held her event the week before., Jamie Hall of the group Unity Vegas, formed last year during the outcry over police shooting deaths of unarmed black men, questioned Bush about the treatment of minorities in the criminal justice system. Later, she called his response \"vague.\", More effective, she said, was the group shouting \"Black lives matter!\" at him, forcing Bush to end the town hall abruptly., \"It made headlines and became an issue for him,\" Hall said. \"Sometimes you have to kick in the door by interrupting. Then it opens new opportunities and conversations.\", The energetic activism has pressured candidates from both parties to grapple with how to address concerns from blacks and Latinos that have been amplified in the wake of high-profile police shootings and no action on immigration reform in Congress., From hiring activists as campaign staffers to holding private meetings, White House hopefuls are adjusting their campaigns in an effort to not only address concerns of the groups, but also to keep a focus on their own message without facing disruptions., Interruptions cant be dismissed, said Stephanie Cutter, a Democratic strategist who worked as President Obamas 2012 deputy campaign manager., During that election cycle, Latino activists upset that Obama did not make immigration reform a central platform in his first term repeatedly protested during campaign rallies. In response, he would point to his executive actions and meet privately with protesters., \"Candidates have to find a way to communicate\" with protesters and let them \"know their issues matter,\" Cutter said., Sanders, who has amassed large crowds while pursuing the Democratic nomination  including an estimated 27,500 in Los Angeles in August  hired campaign staffers who have worked with the Black Lives Matter movement. Faced with protesters, he has sometimes gone off script to tout his record on civil rights dating to the 1960s., \"We see it as an opportunity for him to speak about key issues that people are raising and let them know what his proposals are,\" said campaign spokesman Michael Briggs. \"Its not bad at all.\", Tia Oso was among those who interrupted an event with both Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley in Phoenix in July. Oso  national coordinator for Black Alliance for Just Immigration, which works with Black Lives Matter activists  called on OMalley to recognize high-profile deaths of blacks at the hands of police., His response, \"All lives matter,\" drew further protests, and he later apologized., \"Disruptions and direct confrontations are all a part of strategies and are all tactics for getting the message heard and igniting a movement,\" Oso said in an interview. \"Electoral politics is not our primary focus, though presidential elections are a huge focus in American life. And what were talking about is American life.\", In August activists with the movement released proposals calling for limiting police use of force and increasing oversight of departments., During a recent interview in San Francisco, OMalley said running for president is partly about opening the door to contentious issues., \"Even if sometimes that conversation takes the form of anger and grief and suffering and hurt, its important to be present at the center of that conversation if youre truly offering yourself as a leader,\" said OMalley, who served two terms as mayor of Baltimore before becoming governor., \"When youre a big-city mayor, particularly if youre a minority mayor as I was in a majority African-American city, there was never a night when I wasnt out in public and always very intentionally making myself vulnerable by being present,\" he said. \"You just stop thinking of it in terms of vulnerability and, instead, you think of it in terms of being present and serving.\", One of those seemingly unruffled by interruptions has been GOP front-runner Donald Trump., The billionaire businessman was interrupted at a campaign rally in Phoenix this summer by Latino activists who said his inflammatory rhetoric about Mexicans was racist, but Trump brushed them aside as they were escorted out of the convention hall., His parting words drew applause from supporters., \"Dont worry,\" he said, grinning. \"Well take our country back.

{"Content": "[[, When Chris Christie recently launched his presidential bid with a pep-style rally at his old high school, Jim ONeill pointedly skipped the homecoming event., I didnt want to do anything that would have suggested, even tacitly, that I was supportive of him or his policies, said ONeill, the districts interim superintendent., Christie and ONeill once feuded over superintendent salaries, so the two have a history. But many share ONeills harsh assessment of the states two-term governor., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, Even as Christie travels the country in pursuit of the Republican nomination, his approval rating in New Jersey has plunged, to the woeful 30% range., \"Theres a growing sense among New Jerseyans this guy is simply not on the job and were seeing a state that is stagnating because of it, said Patrick Murray, who directs polling at New Jerseys Monmouth University., Christie is not the only governor with eyes on the White House who faces trouble back home., Wisconsins Scott Walker, one of the top contenders for the Republican nomination, also gets disapproving marks from a majority of constituents, as does Louisianas Bobby Jindal, which raises an obvious question: Why should they be elected president if those who know them best arent pleased with their performance?, The governors speak of the tough decisions theyve had to make as their states chief executive  a contrast, they say, with the many U.S. senators, past and present, who are running for president and have never done anything but debate and vote on legislation., I would be bored to death, Christie once said of life in the Senate. Can you imagine me banging around that chamber with 99 other people? Asking for a motion on the amendment in the subcommittee? Forget it.\", For Christie and Walker, though, the discontent threatens to undercut a key rationale for their presidential campaigns, the argument that support in their Democratic-leaning states shows an ability to broaden the Republican Partys appeal and, ultimately, win the White House., The reasons for the governors sagging approval vary., Jindal, who is focused on rallying the partys conservative base, has alienated old allies in the business community and Louisianas GOP-run Legislature by taking a hard right turn., His refusal to consider tax hikes to close a $1.6-billion deficit, which arose in good part from earlier tax cuts, is seen by critics as an attempt to bolster his political credentials at the expense of the states education and healthcare systems. A May poll gave Jindal a 32% approval rating., \"Theres been an increasing perception in Louisiana that Bobby Jindal has moved on and cares more about the opinion of people outside the state borders than he does about people inside the state borders, said Pearson Cross, a political scientist at the University of Louisiana in Lafayette who is writing a book on Jindal., Timmy Teepell, who is managing Jindals presidential campaign, rejected that assertion. He said Jindal had improved the education and healthcare systems and paid a price for pushing through other big changes, including a sizeable cut in the number of state employees. Those battle scars are still fresh, Teepell said, but will heal when residents see the benefit of Jindals policies., In Wisconsin, the union-battling Walker has long been a polarizing figure, admired by Republicans, loathed by Democrats and generally supported by independent voters. But of late hes been seen more negatively than positively  the most recent Marquette University Law School survey pegged his approval at 41%  as Walker sparred with fellow GOP lawmakers over proposed cuts to education and healthcare and other steps to close a $2.2-billion budget deficit., His difficulties have been compounded by Wisconsins tepid economy, which lags others in the region., Walker said polls go up and down. When people see the benefits of the budget as opposed to just the media talking about the complaints locally, I think well be back on track in the state as we have many times before, Walker said on Fox News., But of all the candidates running, none has fallen further, harder than Christie, who was once considered a front-runner for the GOP nomination but now is fighting to make the cut of 10 candidates allowed onstage for next months first presidential debate., The scandal over a September 2013 traffic tie-up on the George Washington Bridge seriously hurt his reputation, even though Christie vehemently denies involvement in the political revenge plot and no evidence has surfaced to refute that claim. The episode, which came to light months afterward, quickly doused the glow of Christies landslide reelection and cast the governors combative style and brusque personality in a considerably less-flattering light., He might have been forgiven if the states economy was doing better, said Ben Dworkin, who teaches political science at Rider University, just outside the capital in Trenton., Job creation has been weak, the states credit rating has been repeatedly downgraded  its now among the worst in the country  and funding to repair New Jerseys crumbling roads and bridges has nearly run dry., A Christie spokesman provided a long list of actions the governor has taken this year, disputing the notion he has abandoned the state., As for the polls, These things are all temporary snapshots in time and nothing that concerns me much at all, Christie told reporters during an April swing through New Hampshire. ... What matters is who you are and how you present yourself to people., Budget wrangling and economic struggles aside, there is something else that Christie and Jindal, in particular, share: a high rate of absenteeism that contributes to a sense they are more focused on winning the White House than performing the job at hand., Jindal spent close to half of 2014 outside his home state, according to Batons Rouges Advocate newspaper. Christie has been away from New Jersey about 40% of his second term, according to public radio station WNYC., By contrast, Walker stuck comparatively close to home, which may be a reason his approval numbers have held up somewhat better., There is one other GOP governor in the race, Ohios John Kasich, whose 55% positive rating in a February poll seems gaudy compared with his gubernatorial rivals., Hes had differences with Republicans who run the Legislature but benefited from an economic recovery that, by some measures, surpassed the nations performance. He also won praise from Democrats for expanding healthcare access under the Affordable Care Act, though the latter will not play so well in the GOP contest., Kasich, who officially announced his candidacy Tuesday, waited longer than most to start his White House bid. The decks are cleared now that Ohios two-year budget has passed, said University of Akron political analyst John Green. So he can run for president without a perception the states business is unattended., Serving as governor can be a springboard to the presidency; four of the last six had that executive experience., But for some of those running in 2016, it may be a good thing their constituents dont have veto power., NEWSLETTER:Get the days top headlines from Times Editor Davan Maharaj >>, ALSO:, Federal investigators want Justice Department probe of Hillary Clinton emails, Ted Cruz takes on Supreme Court in bid for Republican voters attention, Donald Trumps comments offend many U.S. Latinos, but not all]", "Date": "20150724", "Title": "[Question for governors: Why should you be president when your own constituents don't like you?]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-gop-presidential-govs-20150724-story.html", "Author": "[Mark Z.

{"Content": "[[, When Donald Trump disparaged Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug-runners during his presidential announcement, the slurs were initially dismissed as just another outrageous pronouncement from the blustery billionaire., But as Latinos reel in anger and celebrities and corporate sponsors drop their associations with Trump, the Republican Partys other presidential hopefuls face an increasingly uncomfortable choice: engage with Trump and elevate his already high visibility, or stay silent and risk appearing to condone his statements. So far, most have said little, hoping the controversy will fade., Its the latest Latino problem for the GOP, which will have great difficulty winning the White House if it fails to expand its overwhelmingly white base to include minorities. The problem will only worsen if Trump continues to do well enough in polls to qualify for the partys televised debates., On Wednesday, the controversy mounted as retailer Macys announced it was severing ties with Trump, joining broadcasters Univision and NBC. The moves reflected the growing clout of Latino consumers as well as corporate Americas declining tolerance for racially inflammatory remarks., Trump fired back characteristically, saying that Macys and NBC had totally caved, and that their moves show they support illegal immigration., Republican strategist Ana Navarro said most Republicans viewed Trumps remarks as cringe-worthy, but were reluctant to speak out., Its like getting into an argument with your crazy, distant uncle at Thanksgiving, she said. Why do it when you know hes crazy and you only see him once a year? Most Republicans would prefer to close their eyes and hope that when we open them again, Trump will be gone. Problem is, hes surging in polls and the backlash to his comments is getting bigger and longer. He is the toothache you cant get rid of., Frank Sharry, executive director of the immigration advocacy group Americas Voice, said he was surprised that GOP leaders had not come out more strongly against Trump. Can you imagine if he was talking about Jews? African Americans? Sharry said. Would the GOP stand up? Of course they would. ... But the silence of the GOP on this is defining the party., The flare-up could be a foretaste of what the GOP can expect when the partys presidential debates start next month. With 14 major GOP contenders in the race already and two more on the way, the publicity-loving Trump may have every incentive to interject something inflammatory as a way to stand out., Trump now ranks second after former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush among Republicans nationally, according to a CNN/ORC poll released Wednesday, and he ties for second in the early nominating states of Iowa and New Hampshire, according to other surveys. Thats well above the threshold Trump would need to participate in the first debate in August on Fox News., Having him on stage would be a nightmare scenario for the GOP, said Republican strategist Rick Wilson. Trump is like a trap for us., Theres a segment of people in my party who find this sort of spittle-flecked populism appealing  the bluster of a bellowing, screaming loudmouth  because they think thats the way to win, Wilson said. Theyre frustrated about a lot of things in the Republican Party. But this is not a solution to their problem. This is a solution to [Democratic front-runner] Hillary Clintons problem., Trump has refused to back down or apologize, telling Fox News this week that his June 16 remarks  in which he characterized those crossing the U.S.-Mexico border as mostly criminals, drug-runners and rapists  are totally accurate. He filed a $500-million lawsuit against Univision for announcing it would drop coverage of the Miss USA pageant, which Trump co-owns., Trumps comments have ricocheted across Latino communities in the United States and abroad, reminding many of past GOP attitudes  including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romneys suggestion that immigrants in the United States illegally should simply self-deport, and Rep. Steve Kings (R-Iowa) assertion that young people coming to the United States had calves the size of cantaloupes from carrying drugs across the border., Among the GOP candidates, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) defended Trump, calling him terrific and saying, He speaks the truth., Bush, whose wife is Mexican American and who has openly courted Latinos, has said little publicly beyond a response he gave in Spanish over the weekend to a reporters question after a town hall meeting in Nevada., I do not agree with his remarks, Bush said, according to a translation provided by the campaign. They do not represent the values of the Republican Party and they do not represent my values. The man is wrong., Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), whose parents are from Cuba, has not directly weighed in but appeared last week to downplay the importance of Trumps remarks, calling Trump an incredibly entertaining person., Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, another leading Republican candidate, though undeclared, said the controversy highlights the need to tighten border security. People want to come here because America is a country full of opportunity  good people and bad are coming across our border, Walker said., A spokesman for the Republican National Committee dismissed Trumps comments as last weeks news. But privately, GOP officials are deeply concerned that the controversy will expose the partys bitter divisions over what to do about the nations immigration problem., The Republican Party has worked so hard to try to be inclusive, and to have someone like this spout hate, it just turns everything backward, said Abel Maldonado, a Republican former lieutenant governor of California. Him out there giving hate speech and calling himself a Republican is music to Hillary Clintons ears., Bush and Rubio are widely considered to be the partys strongest candidates for fixing its strained relationship with the fast-growing Latino electorate., Rubio supports some sort of pathway to citizenship for those here illegally, but after a conservative backlash he backed away from a comprehensive immigration overhaul he helped craft in Congress in 2013., Bush said in 2014 that illegal immigration should be seen not as a felony but as an act of love by families seeking to reunite. But his views have shifted over the years on a path to citizenship, leaving his current approach uncertain., Most of the rest of the crowded GOP field, with the exception of immigration-reform supporter and long-shot candidate Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, are running to the right in a way that may appeal to conservative primary voters but not necessarily to the broader electorate., Cruz wants to undo President Obamas executive actions that are helping millions of immigrants temporarily stay in the country without threat of deportation. Walker, who once voiced support for a pathway to citizenship, now has called for those here illegally to go back to their country of origin and apply to reenter legally., Ruben Barrales, the director of Grow Elect, a political committee that supports Latino Republican candidates in California, said Trumps remarks may provide an opening for other GOP candidates, notably Bush and Rubio, who are actually talking about hope and opportunity and reaching out to Latino voters., The eventual GOP nominee will probably need to capture more than 40% of Latino voters to reach the White House, strategists say, a mark not hit by a Republican since George W. Bushs 2004 reelection., That becomes increasingly difficult if the party is seen as hostile to immigrants, especially as Clinton has promised to uphold Obamas executive actions and to create a citizenship pathway. Most Americans, including Republicans, back that approach to citizenship., Democrats have pounced on the opportunity to use Trumps comments against the GOP., As long as Republicans fail to denounce the hateful and divisive comments made by Donald Trump, it will only confirm the GOPs hostility toward the immigrant and Latino community, said Rep. Linda T. Sanchez (D-Whittier), the chairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus., lisa.mascaro@latimes.com, Times staff writer Kate Linthicum in Los Angeles contributed to this report., 6:23 p.m.:This article has been updated for additional details., 4:39 p.m.:This story has been revised throughout., 3:55 p.m.: This story was updated with more reaction and background., 12:35 p.m.: This article was updated to add comments from Republican strategist Ana Navarro.]", "Date": "20150701", "Title": "[Donald Trump's comments on immigration complicate GOP's 'Latino problem']", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-trump-latinos-gop-20150701-story.html", "Author": "[Lisa Mascaro]"}
{"Content": "[[, When he flies home from here Saturday, Jeb Bush can boast that his ripple-free trip to three European nations this week proved he is capable of striding without stumbling on a global stage., But that may not provide much political benefit to the former Florida governor when he launches his presidential campaign Monday in Miami. Republicans probably will remain skeptical of his conservative credentials, especially since he essentially endorsed President Obamas foreign policy on several major issues, including the conflict in Ukraine and the NATO security alliance., Bushs five-day trip to Germany, Poland and Estonia was an exercise in political caution and moderation. He called for a more robust American military presence in Eastern Europe but repeatedly declined to offer specifics., \"Look, Im here to learn  to listen and learn and get a better sense of all this,\" Bush told reporters in Berlin. \"I dont come to offer five-point plans.\", Most important, he avoided the kind of overseas blunders that tripped up Mitt Romney when he was the presumptive 2012 GOP nominee, and that hurt several rivals in this years large and growing Republican field., By that standard, Bushs trip can be judged a success, said Tom Rath, a New Hampshire GOP advisor and Bush family friend who is unaligned so far for 2016., \"These are trips where youre not supposed to make news,\" Rath said. \"Theyre basically flying photo ops, and the most important thing is to do no harm.\", Over the last six months, Bush has raised vast amounts of money for his campaign-in-waiting, and he still leads some polls. But he has failed to break away in a race that many had expected him to dominate from the start., Imagery from his European tour aligned with the persona his aides hope will resonate with voters, not just in the GOP nominating fight but beyond: sober-minded, steady-handed, a self-described policy wonk comfortable discussing world affairs., He made a few public appearances  speaking at a conference in Berlin, laying wreaths at revered sites around Warsaw, meeting cybersecurity experts in Tallinn. He also met privately with the presidents of Poland and Estonia, with the Bush name serving as a high-profile calling card and providing the instant credibility his lesser-known rivals lack., Although Bush has never served in federal office, he had a front-row seat to the presidencies of his father, President George H.W. Bush, and his older brother, President George W. Bush., In Europe, Bush publicly lauded his father, who turned 91 on Friday, as \"the greatest man alive.\" He never once brought up his brother, who is not highly regarded abroad. He and his wife, Columba, even played tourist at times, something his brother famously disdained., Still, Bush hasnt run for office since 2002, and he left the Florida governors mansion in 2007  and its clear after six months back in the public eye that he is still trying to get his sea legs., The starkest example was his stumbling, for several days last month, on what should have been a political softball question: whether, in retrospect, his brother was justified in starting the unpopular war with Iraq. Bush finally said no., On this trip at least, he stayed relentlessly on message  positive and temperate. He hopes to do the same when he takes the stage Monday at a community college in Miami., \"I hope the message will be a hopeful, optimistic one,\" he said here Friday. \"It wont dwell too much in the past. I will talk about why its important to change directions.\", Still, Bush said the trip \"hadnt changed\" his thinking about Americas role in the world, outlining a gauzy view that would fit into the mainstream of either party., \"We cant be all things to all people; we cant be the worlds policeman,\" he said in Warsaw. \"But we can be clear and consistent and engaged  politically and diplomatically and in terms of military, we need to be engaged.\", Bush followed the tradition that it is unseemly to criticize political opponents on foreign soil, offering only mild rebukes of the Obama administration. On Friday, he declined to overtly disparage Democratic presidential favorite Hillary Rodham Clinton., Even his put-down of Russian President Vladimir Putin as a \"bully\" echoed Obamas language. In June 2014, Obama said Russia had acted as a \"bully\" by imposing its \"will at the barrel of a gun\" in Ukraine., Part of Bushs trip was eclipsed back home by reports of a 1995 book he co-wrote, called \"Profiles in Character,\" that called for a return to public shaming to discourage out-of-wedlock births and other behavior he considered immoral or inappropriate., Its a ticklish topic for a party that says it champions \"family values\" but is bitterly divided over the publics growing support for same-sex marriage and other gay rights. Bush spoke carefully when he was asked about the book., \"My views have evolved over time, but my views about the importance of dads being involved in the lives of their children hasnt changed at all,\" he said., He also shrugged off reports of turmoil and squabbling on his staff after he replaced his campaign manager early in the week. With eight months before the first caucus and primary votes are cast, he took the long view., \"It doesnt really matter,\" Bush said in Berlin. \"Its June, for crying out loud, so weve got a long way to go.\", Politicians have been known to travel abroad to get away from their problems at home. To the extent Bush needed a whiff of fresh air and a chance to reset his campaign ahead of his kick-off speech in Miami, his overseas jaunt may prove just the political tonic he needed., seema.mehta@latimes.com, Twitter: @LATSeema, Times staff writer Mark Z.

{"Content": "[[, When I was living in Chile in 1968, my Chilean friends often explained to me proudly that their country was different from other Latin American countries. Chile had a long democratic tradition. Its armed forces had rarely and only briefly meddled in the government, and not at all since 1932. Chile was blessed by a strong cultural identity and a big middle class. It had a diversified economy that combined the worlds largest copper mines with manufacturing and agriculture. Chileans were better educated than other Latin Americans, and they based their universities and agriculture on European models. Most of all, they explained, Chileans knew how to govern themselves, as summarized in the saying \"We Chileans will never be extremists.\", My friends then didnt foresee what would happen five years later. In 1973, after decades of democratic elections, Chiles armed forces overthrew then-President Salvador Allende. The resulting Chilean military government, under General Augusto Pinochet, set modern world records for inventing sadistic sexual tortures too revolting to describe in print. It aimed to exterminate its opponents, \"disappearing\" and killing thousands of Chileans and driving a hundred thousand more into exile. Pinochet held on to power for 17 years., In retrospect, there had been abundant signs of trouble brewing in Chile for years before the coup. The countrys left, right and center political parties, which drew roughly equal numbers of votes, couldnt agree on how to address Chiles chronic economic and social problems, which kept the Congress in a state of gridlock. Allende had been elected by a narrow 36% plurality of voters, and his party coalition controlled neither house of Congress, yet he nevertheless tried to introduce radical political and economic changes., When the armed forces finally launched their coup and imposed a right-wing dictatorship, it initially received broad support from centrist Chileans, frustrated by years of government gridlock and the declining Chilean economy. Moderate Chileans reasoned that the military dictatorship would be just a brief transitional stage necessary to restore functional democracy to Chile., Chile is by no means the only place where government gridlock and breakdown of political compromise led ultimately to military dictatorship, the end of democracy and (in some cases) civil war. Examples include Egypt today, Indonesia in 1957, Spain in the late 1930s and Austria just before the Nazi era., So, should we worry about possible parallels between Chile in 1968 and the U.S. today? On the one hand, it seems unthinkable that the U.S. could drift into dictatorship. Like my Chilean friends then, we Americans are proud of our long democratic tradition and our political stability. We are blessed by a strong national identity and a large middle class. Our highly diversified economy, the biggest in the world, includes resource extraction (especially of oil), manufacturing, agriculture, and technological innovation. Our citizens are highly educated, and we can boast of the worlds best universities. Ever since our nations independence in 1783, we have known how to govern ourselves., But, on the other hand, like Chileans before and under Allende, we have become stuck in political gridlock. Our citizens are split by deep disagreements about basic economic, social and political issues, including government interventions, immigration, investment in education and infrastructure, and inequality of income and opportunity. Our economy is decidedly sluggish., Meanwhile, our politicians have been increasingly unwilling or unable to craft compromises. The most recent Congress passed fewer laws than any Congress in decades. Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill couldnt agree even on matters that should have been noncontroversial, such as funding the Federal Aviation Administration and confirming the nominations of judges and second-level government officers. And American democracy is being eroded by partisan measures aimed at preventing registration or voting by citizens likely to prefer the other party, and by massive distortion of elections by big money., You may object that the American armed forces, unlike those in Chile or Indonesia or Spain, have no precedent at all for interfering in American politics. Thats true. But consider what happened in 1933 in Austria, where private citizens had increasingly been arming themselves and forming private militias. When Austrias Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss abolished the countrys legislature and established an authoritarian right-wing government, he didnt use an Austrian army to crush his left-wing political opponents. He did it with a militia of his own armed supporters., Could that be possible here? Already, plenty of Americans are asserting the right to carry guns in previously unlikely places (such as in schools and government offices). Already, they are forming private militias for purposes such as patrolling the Mexican border and protecting a claimed right to graze cattle on federal lands. Again, when private citizen militias already carry guns for those purposes, its \"just\" a matter of expanding the scope of an established principle to use guns for other purposes., We Americans today are focused on the wrong threats to American democracy. We are obsessed with threats from overseas: from terrorists and Islamist extremists, and from other countries. But realistically, while terrorists and Islamists and other countries will continue to cause trouble for us, the chance of their ending American democracy is nil. The only real threat to American democracy comes from Americans themselves. If our politicians continue to yield to pressure from extremists not to compromise and remain mired in gridlock, the majority of decent Americans may in frustration come to view an authoritarian government as the only solution to political gridlock  as a lesser evil that has to be tolerated., That said, Im not claiming that all political differences can be resolved by compromise, especially when one side or another believes it can prevail without concessions. In Chile in 1973, the armed forces calculated, correctly, that they would quickly win an armed conflict. But Allende and his supporters also believed, incorrectly, that they could prevail, and so saw no need to compromise., Compromise is also unlikely when the opposing parties consider their ideals nonnegotiable, and worth dying for. In 1940, after Hitlers defeat of France placed Britain at great military disadvantage in the face of an expected German invasion, the British Cabinet debated whether to attempt a compromise with Hitler by giving up Malta and Gibraltar in exchange for a peace agreement. Winston Churchill eventually convinced his Cabinet not to compromise. In retrospect, we consider that Churchill was correct in that refusal to compromise., But neither of those impediments to compromise applies to the U.S. today. Americans are divided almost equally between liberals and conservatives; neither side has any reasonable hope of a quick victory if events turn violent. None of the issues about which Americans are now divided seems to me to approach in importance the survival of American democracy. Our issues arent worth dying for, whereas, to the British of 1940, the consequences of a Nazi takeover were indeed worth dying for., Decent Americans should learn from recent history. Compromising cherished political beliefs will be painful, for both Republicans and Democrats. But the alternative, as Chileans and Spaniards can attest, might be something far more painful than compromise., Jared Diamond is a UCLA geography professor and author of \"The World Until Yesterday,\" \"Collapse\" and the Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Guns, Germs and Steel.\", Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion, ]", "Date": "20141226", "Title": "[America needs to study the enemy within]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-diamond-chile-america-democracy-20141228-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, When it comes to Californias roller-coaster finances, Gov. Jerry Brown has bent lawmakers and voters to his will, rejecting new spending programs, passing a temporary tax hike and strengthening the states rainy-day fund., But now a series of tax-related proposals, some backed by powerful interest groups or a rich benefactor, could loosen his tight grip on the budget., Unions and grass-roots organizers are considering an effort to, over Browns objections, extend the higher taxes that the governor persuaded voters to go along with in 2012. They are also pondering a proposal to alter the states landmark restrictions on property taxes, to raise more revenue from commercial interests., In addition, billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer is laying the groundwork for a possible oil extraction tax, medical groups want to raise the levy on cigarettes, and Sen. Bob Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys) is crafting a controversial bid to overhaul the state tax code., The proposals are not aimed at rescuing California from financial disaster  in fact, revenue is surging with the rebounding economy and strong stock market. Rather, they are attempts to gain new funding, press a political agenda or shield against a future recession., \"Now is the time to be bold,\" Hertzberg said. \"Now is the time to figure out the fix. Lets not have another crisis.\", Since taking office in 2011, Brown has been able to avoid any tax hikes he didnt propose. Measures that would have raised tobacco taxes and created new levies on bullets, soda and even strip clubs have died in the Legislature., Although Hertzbergs bill could meet the same fate, a number of the other proposals could end up on the November 2016 ballot if supporters gather enough petition signatures, allowing them to sidestep Browns veto pen and leaving the issue in voters mercurial hands., Tax hikes are usually a tough sell at the ballot box. But next year there will be a presidential election, when more voters typically turn out, especially those who are young, minorities or low-income, and could benefit most from additional government spending., If you want to raise taxes, \"you have one chance every four years,\" said Mark Baldassare, president of the Public Policy Institute of California., Anthony Thigpenn, president of California Calls, a group that advocates for low-income families, cautioned against stuffing the ballot with tax proposals., \"Voters will be overwhelmed and confused and just say no to anything,\" he said. \"Or they compete against each other, and siphon support away so none of them are able to succeed.\", Advocates for the various tax causes are already conducting focus groups, polling voters and tweaking the details of their potential proposals. Brown, who did not include any tax changes in the updated budget plans he released this month, has largely declined to comment on their efforts., \"Im not going to opine on proposals that are just beginning to be formulated,\" he said at the California Democratic Partys recent convention in Anaheim., However, he has publicly opposed an extension of Proposition 30, the 2012 measure that temporarily increased the sales tax by a quarter-cent and raised levies on high earners. Its scheduled to expire in two parts  the higher sales tax at the end of next year and the higher income tax at the end of 2018., Brown is \"not going to break faith with the voters on that,\" Nancy McFadden, a top advisor to the governor, said last year., The revenue boost was pitched to voters as being necessary to pull the state out of its persistent budget crises. But unions and other advocates are unnerved by the prospect of state income slipping away., \"Wed go back to seeing cuts,\" said Estelle Lemieux, a lobbyist for the California Teachers Assn., Although the powerful teachers union is typically allied with Brown, its members are nevertheless discussing a possible extension proposal. Lemieux said a final decision could be made in the next few months., Analysts said that continuing Proposition 30 could be difficult without the governors support. In addition, state finances are healthier., When its time to cast ballots, said Aaron McLear, a Republican strategist who worked against Proposition 30 in 2012, there will probably be \"a giant surplus, a balanced budget and a rainy-day fund. It would be very difficult to convince [voters] that we need more money.\", The other major union-backed measure under consideration would modify Proposition 13, the landmark restriction on property taxes that voters passed in 1978, to impose higher levies on commercial buildings with more frequent reassessments of their value., Supporters of the idea said it would raise $9 billion a year for local governments and schools., Proposition 13, long the third rail of California politics, represents a contentious time in Browns first two terms as governor, from 1975 to 1983. He has expressed regret for not offering an alternative plan that might have prevented the measure from passing, but he has also called it a \"sacred doctrine that should never be questioned.\", A battle over the issue would surely be expensive, with business interests able to mount a sizable opposition effort. Rex Hime, president of the California Business Properties Assn., has said such a fight would be \"Armageddon.\", Other potential measures could also attract big money., Steyer is considering a bid to create a 10% tax on oil extraction, which his organization, NextGen Climate, says could provide up to $2 billion for higher education., If he pushed forward with a campaign, he wouldnt be the first rich donor to give it a try. Hollywood producer Steve Bing provided most of the $60 million for a 2006 ballot measure, which was defeated after oil companies spent $90 million in opposition and raised the specter of higher gas prices., Its unclear how much Steyer would be willing to spend. He put $74 million behind candidates around the country last year., Tobacco companies would certainly spend heavily to stop a $2-per-pack increase in cigarette taxes, if such a proposal failed in the Legislature this year and landed on the ballot., Voters rejected a similar measure in June 2012, but advocates want to give it another try in order to restore some money to public healthcare that was lost during the recession., \"We view this initiative as a wonderful opportunity to reduce smoking in California and at the same time bolster healthcare services,\" said Dustin Corcoran, executive director of the California Medical Assn., which lobbies for doctors., In his own legislation, Hertzberg is taking aim at the states notoriously volatile finances. In recent years, the budget has drawn about half of its income tax revenue from the top 1% of earners, whose income is unpredictable because they rely heavily on stock market performance., Although Hertzberg is still drafting his proposal, he has expressed interest in applying the sales tax to services and weaning the state off its dependence on income taxes., Brown has been skeptical because proposals to stabilize revenue collection generally involve requiring people who make less money to pay a greater share of the taxes  a tough sell in a largely Democratic state., \"I dont know from the political point of view thats very viable,\" Brown said., Hertzberg is undeterred., \"Were still working out the details,\" he said., chris.megerian@latimes.com, Twitter: @chrismegerian]", "Date": "20150525", "Title": "[Tax proposals by unions, activists may loosen Brown's grip on budget ]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-pol-state-taxes-20150526-story.html", "Author": "[Chris Megerian]"}
{"Content": "[[, When it convenes Jan. 6, the Republican-controlled 114th Congress will bring a wave of reinforcements to enhance the clout of President Obamas antagonists., But it remains to be seen whether that will set the stage for two years of continuing conflict or open a door to compromise as both parties seek to lay the groundwork for the 2016 presidential race. Here is a look at eight lawmakers who will probably play key roles in the 2015 congressional battles., The hard-liners: Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas usually grabs most of the attention, but look for Sen. Mike Lee of Utah to step out of that shadow as a prominent leader of the Republicans tea party wing. Lee was Cruzs chief ally in past showdowns, such as the effort to defund Obamas signature healthcare law and the presidents executive actions on immigration this winter. Both issues are certain to be on the agenda next year., After unseating a moderate Republican incumbent in 2010, Lee has quietly worked to develop a conservative policy platform on a range of issues. But the 114th Congress will pose a test for Lee and his conservative convictions as members of the Republicans establishment wing consider mounting a 2016 primary campaign against him in the solidly Republican state., For Democrats, the next two years may be judged by how Sen. Elizabeth Warren wields her influence with the partys progressive base. Until recently, she had largely followed the traditional low-profile route for new senators. But last months fight over a major spending bill, which included 11th-hour changes to relax Dodd-Frank Act banking regulations, prompted Warren to take a leading role against the deal., Warren now boasts a new, somewhat informal leadership title for Senate Democrats as they begin life as the chambers minority party for the first time in eight years. She says she is not running for president in 2016, but hasnt slammed the door shut in the way Hillary Rodham Clinton and other would-be Democratic presidential hopefuls might like., The insiders: Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio has been a behind-the-scenes player in Washington for years  including six terms in the House and two years in George W. Bushs administration as trade representative and then budget director. He was on Mitt Romneys short list for vice president in 2012, and mulled a 2016 presidential bid of his own before announcing last month that he would focus instead on running for reelection to the Senate., Incoming Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was among the happiest at Portmans decision. Not only does it mean McConnell probably doesnt need to worry about Republicans losing the seat in 2016, it also frees Portman to focus on helping the Kentuckian advance party priorities. Portmans background makes him a natural for helping to guide the budget-writing process that will consume Washington for much of the early part of the year. Hell also have a seat at the table for talks about tax reform, an area of possible common ground between Obama and Republicans., With outgoing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid inclined to focus on his own 2016 reelection fight, Sen. Charles E. Schumer will take on more responsibility in managing how Democrats adjust to their new status in the minority. Schumer has worked to build bridges with Republicans even as hes been one of his partys primary political strategists. The New York Democrat has been seen as Reids most likely successor, but the elevation of Warren into leadership underscored the challenges Schumer will face in leading a caucus with an increasingly vocal progressive wing., The leaders: Rep. Kevin McCarthy begins his first full term as the House majority leader in January, after Eric Cantors shocking primary election loss in June led to a promotion for the five-term Bakersfield congressman. His more low-key and back-slapping style has been received warmly among the Republican rank and file, but that doesnt mean hes been able to avoid the internal party divisions that vexed his predecessor. The real test for McCarthy in the new Congress will be to demonstrate he has as much heft in policy as he has in politics., Democrat Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico is one of the only new faces in the House Democratic leadership next year, assuming the role of chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) tapped the 42-year-old amid angst within the party over its direction as Democrats start 2015 with the fewest House seats since 1949. Lujans primary job will be helping put Democrats within striking distance to regain the House majority heading into 2016, but hell also provide a voice for newer members at the leadership table., The swing-state senators: Republicans successful election night gave the party a slightly bigger cushion in the upper chamber than many expected  54 seats. That could be key considering that the 2016 election map favors Democrats because of the high number of Republican incumbents facing reelection in states that Democrats have carried consistently in recent presidential election years., Sen. Mark Steven Kirk of Illinois, who won the seat Obama vacated to become president, could be the most vulnerable. Kirk has forged a reputation as a moderate Republican during multiple terms representing the Chicago suburbs in the House and during his first term in the Senate. Whether that continues to suit state voters, and whether he can mount a vigorous campaign as he continues to recover from a stroke, will be key to whether Republicans can hold their majority into the next presidential administration., Aside from Reid, Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado is one of the few Democratic incumbents who will be running in a competitive state in 2016. Bennet was first appointed to the Senate and then won a tough election fight in the otherwise Republican-friendly year of 2010. The 2014 Democratic losses were especially tough on Bennet because of his role as the partys campaign committee chairman., michael.memoli@latimes.com]", "Date": "20141231", "Title": "[Eight lawmakers to watch in the 114th Congress]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-year-ahead-congress-20141231-story.html", "Author": "[Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, When it passed legislation to fix the troubled Veterans Affairs Department, Congress managed to do two things lawmakers have often vowed to avoid: create a new benefit program and fail to pay for it., The $16.3-billion measure, which President Obama plans to sign into law Thursday, aims to solve the alarming backlog for care at VA facilities by allowing veterans to see private doctors at the governments expense. Veterans can use the new option if they face a wait of 30 days or more or live more than 40 miles from a VA facility., Creating that new benefit would allow many more veterans to get care, but would increase spending by $10 billion, added to the deficit. The rest of the money in the bill would go to expand existing VA programs, personnel and facilities and would be offset by reductions elsewhere in the budget., That could be just for starters. Congress limited the upfront cost of the new private-care option by creating it as a stop-gap  a temporary fix for three years or until the money runs out, whichever comes first., But temporary has a way of becoming permanent in Washington, especially when lawmakers face a group as sympathetic and politically potent as veterans., The money Congress allocated for private care would run out by the end of next year, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. That would be just as Washington gears up for another election. The odds of Congress pulling the plug on a popular benefit for veterans in an election year seem long, analysts in both parties say., Just as unlikely is the prospect of the two parties agreeing on tax increases or new spending cuts to fully cover the costs., If, as many expect, Congress extends the program past its current expiration date, the cost to taxpayers would be at least $7 billion a year and perhaps more, depending on how many veterans choose private care, budget office projections indicate., \"Its going to be treated like any of the other entitlements: Were going to pay for it,\" said Lawrence J. Korb, a former assistant secretary of Defense under President Reagan and now a senior fellow at the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress. \"You show up, were going to take care of it and pay the bill.\", The creation of a new benefit for veterans illustrates how even the budget-cutting fervor of House Republicans, who have made reducing federal spending their top priority, can be overturned by a big enough political push., Earlier this session, the House balked at providing funds for hurricane relief unless the expenditure was fully offset by budget cuts elsewhere. Last week, emergency funds to fight wildfires in the West were blocked in the Senate., But faced with enormous political pressure to respond to delays at VA medical centers after Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric K. Shinseki resigned, Congress passed the veterans bill with opposition from just five lawmakers in the House and three in the Senate., \"Forty dead veterans that died in line, that was enough for me,\" Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), a conservative stalwart, told reporters last week about his reason for supporting the bill., Investigators have found long backlogs at VA hospitals across the country and several cases of veterans who died while waiting for appointments, but have not determined whether any veterans died as a result of delays., On the other side of the issue, Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, one of the three Republican senators who voted no, warned of putting in place \"yet another long-term unfunded liability.\", Congress \"rushed through a piece of legislation without thoroughly reviewing its full fiscal impact on future generations,\" Corker said in a statement after the vote., While deficit hawks fret about the long-term costs of the private-care option, leaders of many veterans groups worry about a different concern  that in the future, Congress might decide to pay for private care by siphoning off resources and eroding the VA system., Some members of Congress, primarily conservative Republicans, have for years argued the VA could be largely replaced by government payments to private doctors and hospitals., VA officials counter that surveys show most of the more than 8 million veterans who utilize VA healthcare are satisfied with the care they get, although they object to the long waits., Though the VAs medical budget has essentially doubled over the decade, VA facilities have been overwhelmed with new patients returning from the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, along with the aging Vietnam War-era population. Liberalized rules, including expanded eligibility for claims of Agent Orange exposure, have also boosted the number of patients., The most severely disabled vets, including those with service-related brain and spinal cord injuries, say the VA provides specialty care that cannot easily be replicated in the private sector., \"Theres still a little of an ideological battle thats playing out here,\" said Carl Blake, director of government relations for Paralyzed Veterans of America, who was among those who fought for a sunset provision that would end the private-care option after three years., \"We dont want this to become the way healthcare is delivered in the VA,\" he said. \"Our focus has always been on strengthening VA.\", To that end, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, who negotiated the package with his Republican counterpart in the House, Rep. Jeff Miller of Florida, insisted on including $5 billion to allow the VA to hire more doctors, nurses and other medical personnel., Administration officials had said the VA needed almost twice that amount. And the final product was not the one he would have written, Sanders said. But, he added, \"very, very difficult\" talks with House Republicans had resulted in an acceptable compromise., \"We have people who have put their lives on the lines, people have come back with a whole lot of problems, and it would be an absolute disgrace to this country if we did not address their needs,\" Sanders said, noting that the wars in which the veterans fought also were paid for by increased deficits., For the next year, both the private and government paths for improving veterans medical care will be followed before the emergency funds run out and Congress must once again find a way to pay for the program or kick a decision into the future., \"It starts a conversation, I think, about VA for the future,\" said Miller, the House veterans committee chairman. \"The VA is not sacred. The veteran is.\", lisa.mascaro@latimes.com]", "Date": "20140806", "Title": "[Lawmakers' costly plan to fix Veterans Affairs is temporary, or not]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/business/healthcare/la-na-va-reform-20140807-story.html", "Author": "[Lisa Mascaro]"}
{"Content": "[[, When Jeb Bush completed two terms as governor of Florida in 2007, he reported his net worth at $1.3 million, about $700,000 less than when he took office., Today, nearly eight years later, he is a wealthier man. He has plunged into business and entrepreneurial ventures involving consulting, the paid lecture circuit and energy development. He has developed real estate, advised international investment banks and joined high-paying corporate boards., ------------FOR THE RECORD: Jeb Bush: An article in Section A on Dec. 26 about former Florida Gov. Jeb Bushs financial affairs quoted a spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell, as saying that an investment fund, BH Global Aviation, was set up overseas to protect it from having to comply with U.S. business regulations. Actually, Campbell said the fund was structured that way because its only investment, Hawker Pacific, has no operations in the United States and therefore does not need to make U.S. corporate filings.   ------------, But as he considers a run for president in 2016, Bush has begun to unwind some of his financial affairs, apparently to avoid the kind of criticism that hobbled fellow Republican Mitt Romney in his unsuccessful bid for the White House in 2012., Bush is quitting Tenet Healthcare Corp.  a company that has profited from Obamacare  and is ending a consulting contract with Barclays Bank to focus on his political future. Aides say he also has stopped giving highly paid speeches to focus on traveling America, meeting with potential donors and testing what a friend calls a visionary brand of campaigning., But Bushs business record, enmeshed in international finance and some troubled former ventures in south Florida, could end up complicating his return to politics and his hopes to follow his father, George H.W. Bush, and his older brother, George W. Bush, into the Oval Office., Last year, he took a step into the rarefied world of private equity and offshore investments, joining with former banking executives and a Chinese airline company to make bets on natural gas exploration and shipping. One of the funds was set up in the United Kingdom, a structure that allows the company to shield overseas investors from U.S. taxes., During the 2012 race, Romney drew ceaseless attacks from Democrats for his lucrative work at Bain Capital, a pioneering venture capital company that bought scores of troubled companies, took over their management and sometimes laid off employees while garnering huge fees and payouts., But Bush and his aides argue that his investments and entrepreneurial ventures are different because he isnt taking control of companies and restructuring them., These are all growth investments that the governor has worked on, said Bushs spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell., Bushs latest undertaking is as a partner in three privately held funds that have raised a total of $127 million for investments in domestic and foreign companies. Bill Parish, an investment advisor in Portland, Ore., says the funds are fairly small in the private equity world., But in the heat of a political campaign, Parish said, opaque investment vehicles, especially involving overseas accounts, inevitably will raise questions about the identities of his investors and the nature of their businesses., If hes smart, hes going to take care of it and shut them down, Parish said., Campbell said the 61-year-old former governor is reviewing all his engagements and his business commitments now that hes begun to focus on a potential race. Thats a natural next step, she said., Born and raised in Texas, Bush moved in 1981 to Miami, where his wifes family lived, and went to work for a wealthy Cuban-born businessman, Armando Codina. Both had worked on George H.W. Bushs failed bid for the Republican Partys 1980 presidential nomination, and Codina ultimately made the younger Bush a partner in a south Florida real estate development firm., In 1986, Bush got into politics when he was named Floridas commerce secretary. He quit in 1988 to help his father, then the vice president, win the White House. In 1994, the younger Bush lost his first race for the governors mansion, but four years later he won, and ultimately became Floridas first two-term Republican governor., After leaving office in 2007, he set up Jeb Bush and Associates, a management consulting firm. His son, Jeb Bush Jr., serves as managing partner. Bush has said the firms clients range from Fortune 500 companies to small tech startups, but Campbell declined to discuss the companys business or identify its clients., That same year, Bush also was hired as an advisor to Lehman Brothers, the New York investment bank and financial services firm. When Lehman collapsed in bankruptcy in 2008 amid the global financial crisis, Bush shifted to Barclays, the London-based multinational banking and financial services giant that bought Lehman Brothers North American divisions., He got involved in a venture that provides disaster response services. He and two partners also set up another company, Maghicle Driverless, that is trying to develop self-driving vehicles for passengers and cargo., He was grabbing at a lot of things to make money quickly, said Susan MacManus, a political science professor at the University of South Florida., Now Bush has begun to pull back., Campbell, the Bush spokeswoman, said he will leave Barclays by Dec. 31 to focus on a possible presidential run. She said his work for Lehman Brothers and Barclays was mostly offering clients his perspective on the impact of economic trends, regulations and policies., And on Wednesday, Bush resigned from the board of directors of Tenet Healthcare Corp., also effective Dec. 31, according to a corporate filing. The Dallas-based company actively supported the 2010 Affordable Care Act, and has seen its revenue rise from it, an issue that could draw fire in Republican primaries., Bush earned cash and stock awards worth nearly $300,000 from Tenet in 2013, according to corporate filings. He also sold Tenet stock worth $1.1 million that year, the records show., Mr. Bush is not resigning on account of any disagreement with Tenet, the company said., Bush remains on the board of directors of a Florida-based timberland owner, Rayonier, which paid him about $200,000 last year, according to the companys proxy statement., Some of Bushs business ventures have gone badly., In 2007, Bush joined InnoVida, a Miami manufacturer of composite building materials, winning a seat on the board and a $15,000-a-month consulting contract. At the time, company president Claudio Osorio was a big player in Miamis glitzy social and political world, hosting fundraisers at his Star Island mansion for Democratic politicians like Hillary Rodham Clinton and, in 2008, for then-Sen. Barack Obama., In March 2010, InnoVida obtained a $10-million federal loan to build homes and a factory in earthquake-wrecked Haiti. But Osorio scammed millions from that loan and from investors, according to a federal indictment filed in Miami., A Securities and Exchange Commission complaint in 2012 said Osorio had recruited Bush and other high-profile figures to lend an air of legitimacy to InnoVida and help him raise money. In 2013, Osorio pleaded guilty to fraud charges and was sentenced to 121/2 years in prison., Bush was paid a total of $468,901 before leaving InnoVida in September 2010. A court-approved settlement agreement in the companys bankruptcy case says he provided substantial assistance to investigations into the companys finances, and he agreed to pay back $270,000 to the bankruptcy court., His foray into private equity began last year with three banking industry veterans: Amar Bajpai, formerly of Lehman Brothers; Ross Rodrigues, a former Credit Suisse analyst and hedge fund principal; and David Savett, a former energy trader at Credit Suisse. Details were first reported by Bloomberg News., Their firm, Britton Hill Holdings, named after the highest point in Florida, raised $40.4 million from investors and put it in Inflection Energy, a Denver-based company that has been investing in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking  specifically, in natural gas wells in the Marcellus shale region in Pennsylvania and New York., Bush and his partners also set up two other funds., BH Logistics raised $26 million and invested it in Dorian LPG Ltd., a shipping company incorporated last year in the Marshall Islands to transport propane gas. BH Global Aviation, based in the United Kingdom, raised $60.8 million. That money was invested in Hawker Pacific, an aviation sales and services firm based in Hong Kong that mainly does business in Asia and Australia., Hawker Pacific has no operations in the United States, and the investment fund was set up overseas to protect the company from having to comply with U.S. business regulations, Campbell said., Nearly all of the money for Dorian LPG Ltd. and BH Global Aviation came from investors outside the United States, according to Security and Exchange Commission filings., The biggest investor was a Chinese firm called HNA Group, a conglomerate that includes an airline and other businesses. In a news release, HNA said its investment in Dorian was part of a plan to build a distribution network in China to take advantage of the significant opportunities for growth in propane., Al Cardenas, former Republican Party chairman in Florida and a longtime friend of Bush, says he doesnt think the former governors involvement with international finance will hurt his appeal should he run for president., I think hes always been an honest man in business and in politics, Cardenas said. Hes comfortable with his actions and what hes done. All the public wants to know is that you behaved honorably and that you care for them., MacManus, the political science professor, isnt so sure. Some of Bushs business dealings might draw heat during a campaign, particularly from unbridled outside political groups., The thing with investments, she said, is that theres always something to criticize., Twitter: @jtanfani]", "Date": "20141225", "Title": "[Jeb Bush eases out of some businesses, such as firm helped by Obamacare]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-jeb-bush-money-20141225-story.html", "Author": "[Joseph Tanfani]"}
{"Content": "[[, When Jeb Bush was born, his big brother didnt exactly celebrate the news., As a kid, George viewed him as a completely unnecessary addition to the family, John Ellis, a Bush cousin, recounted years later. Jebbie was just a pain. I think that carried on for a long time., Sibling relations can be fraught, a tangle of love, envy and compassion. In that way, Jeb and George W. Bush  separated by nearly seven years and vastly different life experiences  are no different than any other set of brothers., But they are, of course, like no other: Theyre part of a political dynasty, and their dramas play out for the world to watch, their personal history entwined with that of their country., As he strives to become the third member of his family to win the White House, Jeb Bush bears the blessings as well as the burdens of that heritage and, especially, the legacy of his brother, who left the presidency a scant 6 years ago amid an unpopular war and the near-collapse of the U.S. economy., Conflating the two, however, masks a more complex relationship, marked by fierce rivalry, wounded feelings and long periods of estrangement., Though they share the same political philosophy  both are more conservative Republicans than their father, President George H.W. Bush  they have never been personally close., Stylistically, they stand poles apart: George W. Bush, 68, outgoing and gregarious, using gut instinct as a guide; Jeb Bush, 62, introverted, data-driven and happiest burrowing in the nooks of a briefing book., Ron Kaufman, an old family friend, remembers seeing the pair once at a black-tie dinner, where George W. Bush, then Texas governor, was in his back-slapping element. Jeb Bush, Floridas new governor, was politely pleasant but his eyes were saying hed rather be back in Tallahassee, Kaufman recalled, working on the state budget., One constant, though, has been loyalty, to the family cause and one another., Jeb Bushs most politically difficult moments of the 2016 campaign surround his fumbling response when asked whether he supported the Iraq war his brother started. Bush took several days, shaping and reshaping his answer, before flatly declaring that, in retrospect, the invasion should never have taken place., A few days later, it was news when Bush took issue with his brothers fiscal policies, suggesting he should have been quicker to wield his veto pen. He could have brought budget discipline to Washington, D.C., Bush said., Such public breaches, however, are extremely rare., I love my mom and dad, Bush recently told a New Hampshire audience. (He sometimes preempts questions about family and fealty by speaking up before asked.) I love my brother, and people are just going to have to get over that. Thats just the way it is., The sentiment, however, was not always reciprocated., When they were young, Jeb was somebody for George to torture, their cousin Ellis recounted in the 2004 book The Bushes: Portrait of a Dynasty., As adults, the two grew even further apart. One advisor to George W. Bushs 2000 presidential campaign recalls him rolling his eyes when his brother chimed in on conference calls, suggesting if they werent related they would probably have nothing to do with each other., From early on the brothers forged strikingly different paths., George W. Bush followed his fathers route through New England prep school and Yale, where he was an unimpressive student. After graduating, he eagerly partook of bachelor life in Houston  I was a spirited lad, he later said with wry understatement  and spent more than a decade knocking about the oil business, with middling success. Bush was married with twin daughters when he finally quit drinking, after a 40th birthday bash that was a haze, save for the hangover., John Ellis Bush, by contrast, breezed through the University of Texas in 2  years, married at age 21 and moved to Florida, partly because of the social ostracism faced by his wife, Columba, a native of Mexico. He became a father at 23  the couple has three children  and grew rich in Miamis booming real estate business. In the early 1980s, he became active in state Republican politics, helped along by the Bush name; his father was then vice president under Ronald Reagan., The year 1994 was pivotal for both brothers., Jeb Bush was running for Florida governor when George W., by then an executive with the Texas Rangers baseball team, unexpectedly launched an uphill bid for governor of his home state. Jeb Bush made no secret of his displeasure, griping that his brothers Texas candidacy turned their twin campaigns into a cute People magazine story., Jeb  the sober, dutiful son  had always been the one expected to assume the Bush political mantle. George W. was good for laughs, but not a lot more. It was a shock then, both inside the family and out, when Jeb lost his race and George W. won. The latter kept eager track of the competition with his sibling, checking the private Florida polling each morning to see where his race stood compared with his brothers., On election night, George W. was struck that his parents seemed more upset about Jebs loss than happy for his victory. Why do you feel bad about Jeb? he asked his father during a phone call that has become political lore. Why dont you feel good about me?, Still, four years later, Bush rallied to help his demoralized brother win a second try for Florida governor, tapping his Texas fundraising base and schooling his supposedly more astute sibling., There is a great lesson of humility ... that George has shown to his great popular benefit, Jeb Bush told the Dallas Morning News before winning his 1998 race. The ability to share credit, to include everybody, to make a point to talk to people who didnt support him. Thats a useful lesson in governance, but it also applies to campaigns., The evolution of the brothers relationship, from condescension to grudging respect, recalls that of another famous pair of dynastic offspring, John F. Kennedy and his younger brother Robert. The older Kennedy spent much of his life dismissing his sibling  he appointed him attorney general largely to appease their father  until they forged a strong bond during the crucible of the Cuban missile crisis., The trial that drew the Bush brothers closer was the 2000 Florida recount, in which Jeb played an important behind-the-scenes role helping deliver the electoral votes that put George W. Bush in the White House. Among Jebs first steps was ensuring his brother locked up the top legal talent in the state, hampering Democrat Al Gore in the rush to the courthouse., When George W. Bush was president, Jeb mostly muffled their differences, though he did speak out against a plan to expand oil drilling off the Florida coast  it was sharply cut back  and challenged aspects of the presidents No Child Left Behind education initiative., A rare social visitor to the White House, Jeb nonetheless benefited during his 2002 reelection campaign from a steady flow of federal dollars to Florida and a parade of Bush administration luminaries., Two years later, with George W. seeking a second term and Florida once more in play, Jeb laid low rather than hurt his brother by risking an association with his political problems. The president carried Florida easily., Their interactions reflect a pattern: Whatever hostilities or hard feelings built up, the two have been there for each other in their times of political need, publicly when it suited them, but more often in less obvious fashion., It is an arrangement, say those familiar with Bush family dynamics, that will likely persist., Sibling rivalry aside, blood is thicker than water, said David Beckwith, who worked in the administration of George H.W. Bush, where he got to know both brothers. W. will do whatever he can to help.

{"Content": "[[, When Pope Francis visits New York, he is not likely to take the subway, but Gene Russianoff wishes he would., Specifically, Russianoff would like the pontiff to take a ride on the Lexington Avenue line, whose 4, 5 and 6 trains are frequently delayed as riders stuff themselves into the crowded cars that are the only ones serving Manhattans east side., \"Its unbearable,\" said Russianoff, executive director of New Yorks Straphangers Campaign, a watchdog group that since 1979 has badgered the nations largest public transportation system to improve. \"Youve just got to steel yourself.\", Pope Francis is a great advocate of public transportation, and in a spring encyclical he urged cities to prioritize public transportation to help the environment and to alleviate \"undignified conditions\" endured by riders., The pontiff speaks from experience. When he was a cardinal in Buenos Aires, he regularly rode the subways and buses., NEWSLETTER:Get the days top headlines from Times Editor Davan Maharaj >>, Russianoff speaks from experience too. A native New Yorker and a Harvard-educated lawyer, he has never owned a car. The subway stations closest to where he lived and worked over the years became as familiar as a home driveway is to most Californians., Subway riders know where on the platform to stand if they want to get into the best car for launching them on a quick exit at their destination. They know which metro card machines work well and which ones spit out their credit or debit cards. They know how late the news stands, bodegas and shoe repair shops inside their stations stay open. They get familiar with their stations regular characters, from the homeless people to the religious zealots handing out leaflets., When the subways work well, they are a riders best friend, in sync like a perfect dance partner. But any hiccup, whether caused by kittens on the tracks, a sick passenger or a looming hurricane or blizzard, can throw off the entire city., That is where the Straphangers Campaign, part of the nonprofit New York Public Interest Research Group, comes in., \"We show tough love,\" Russianoff said of the Straphangers, named for the leather loops that used to hang inside subway cars, offering standing riders something to hang onto as they rumbled beneath the city., The group obsessively monitors the lines linking the five boroughs, noting which are most crowded, dirtiest, slowest or plagued by sound systems whose announcements sound more like anguished squawks than helpful messages., In its annual subway report card, released last week, the campaign also notes the best subway lines. This year, the 7 train, which runs from Manhattans west side into Queens, won top honors. The 5 train and the B, which goes from Brooklyn up Manhattans west side, tied for last place., The campaign regularly battles fare increases and fights for communities, most of them in poor and underserved areas, facing service shortfalls., It has advocated for modern features like digital clocks advising riders how long they have to wait for the next train, and cards to replace the tokens that were phased out in 2003., The high-profile fights have brought Russianoff, 62, a measure of fame., Once he was recognized while riding on the much-maligned C train. The only other person in his car was an \"extremely large gentleman,\" Russianoff said during an interview in his Brooklyn home., \"He got up and started to walk  I would say stagger  toward me,\" Russianoff said. \"I thought, This is it. Im gonna buy it on the C train. He came over to me and says, Are you the subway guy?\", Instead of mugging him, the fellow rider praised his activism, something Russianoff says happens two or three times a week., For all his criticism of the subways, Russianoff calls it a \"great system\" that is far better than in the 1980s, when a friend used to joke that he had a strict ridership rule: Never board a car with the chalk outline of a body on the floor., Back then, subway muggings were rife. Stations were dimly lit with 37-watt bulbs, whose eerie glows added to the subways menacing feel. Cars were splattered with graffiti, and air conditioning was not the norm. Cars broke down every few thousand miles; todays cars go more than 150,000 miles between breakdowns., \"Things were bad. Now theyre better,\" Russianoff said, praising the system for offering New Yorkers 24-hour subway service seven days a week. You wont find that in London, Paris, Moscow, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston or Washington., The subways also offer one flat fare  $2.75, with various discounts available  keeping transportation costs relatively low for New Yorkers who travel long distances to work. There are free subway-to-bus transfers, a development in 1996 that Russianoff joked was akin to the fall of the Berlin Wall., \"Nobody ever believed it would happen,\" he said., But Russianoff says things have slipped in recent years, mainly because of rising ridership and delays in major extensions., The system averages 5.6 million rides per day. An extension of the 7 line just opened, nearly two years after it had been envisioned for completion. The first phase of a new line on Manhattans east side, initially proposed in 1919, wont open until the end of 2016. The entire line is not expected to be finished until 2029., \"You gotta hope. Its desperately needed,\" said Russianoff, who admits being skeptical., In recent years, the Straphangers Campaign has pushed to improve bus service to lighten the load on the subways., But unlike Los Angeles and other cities with wide, bus-friendly avenues, New York City is laced with narrow streets jammed with delivery trucks, taxis, private vehicles and, in recent years, bicycle lanes, all competing for space and guaranteeing traffic jams. Last year, the Straphangers gave its annual Pokey Award, for the citys slowest bus route, to a 79th Street line, which it said moved at 3.2 mph, slower than lava oozing from Hawaiis Kilauea volcano., SIGN UP for the free Great Reads newsletter >>, That leaves underground travel the best option for getting somewhere fast, and ensures that every battle Russianoff takes on will be closely watched by millions of riders., \"It takes a lot of chutzpah,\" he said of his job. \"New York is a tough audience.\", As for Pope Francis, if he were to ride the subway, chances are hed be on the Lexington Avenue line part of the time because of his itinerary., The Secret Service, which is overseeing security for Francis visit, was asked at a recent briefing if the pontiff had indicated a desire to use public transportation., \"We hope not,\" said Robert J. Sica, head of the Secret Services New York office., The citys police commissioner, William J. Bratton, chimed in. \"And if he does, he better pay the fare.\", However he gets around, Francis appeal for better public transport has struck a chord in New York., \"He cares about the public and whats on the publics mind, and this is one of those key things,\" Russianoff said. \"He could be a member of the Straphangers Campaign.\", tina.susman@latimes.com , Twitter:@tinasusman, MORE ON THE POPE IN THE U.S., Pope Francis, whose vision has captivated the world, brings it to North America, Pope Francis U.S. visit may have political value for President Obama, who shares some views, Awaiting Pope Francis visit, LGBT Catholics and supporters in U.S. are hopeful]", "Date": "20150921", "Title": "[New York subway watchdog hopes Pope Francis climbs aboard]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-pope-visit-subways-20150921-story.html", "Author": "[Tina Susman]"}
{"Content": "[[, When President Obama began his second term  the time presidents traditionally build foreign policy legacies  he had two major projects in the Middle East: a nuclear agreement with Iran and a peace settlement based on a Palestinian state. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu planted himself firmly in the way of both., Much has been made of how the two leaders lack personal chemistry. But its worse than that; on those two core issues, they collide head-on., On Iran, Netanyahu came to Washington to rally opposition to the deal Obama is seeking  even before an agreement was struck. On a Palestinian state, U.S. officials have concluded that the Israeli leader never intended to say yes, despite his on-again, off-again endorsement of the idea., So where does the U.S. go from here? I asked Martin Indyk of the Brookings Institution, the chief American negotiator in the last round of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. His advice boils down to tough love and damage control., Give Netanyahu incentives to keep the door open to a two-state solution, even if he doesnt want one, Indyk said., During his reelection campaign, the prime minister said he would never agree to a Palestinian state. But once the election was over, he said he merely meant it was unsafe for Israel to agree to a state as long as Islamist terrorists are roaming the Arab world, Iran is funding extremists and the Palestinians tolerate the presence of Hamas. He sounded like the classic New Yorker cartoon about a lunch date: How about never  is never good for you?, Equally important, Indyk said, the U.S. should create clear disincentives for anything that would foreclose a two-state solution. A leading option: the threat of U.S. support for a United Nations resolution that would specify peace terms whether Israel agrees or not. , The administration should judge the prime minister by his deeds  because it will be difficult, going forward, to rely upon his words, Indyk told me. What deeds? Netanyahu should release the Palestinian tax revenues it has seized and encourage Congress to continue funding the Palestinian Authority, as long as the Palestinians stop pursuing legal action against Israel in the International Criminal Court., On settlements, if Netanyahu really wants a two-state solution, he wont allow new settlement construction to go up beyond the Israeli security barrier. Hell also allow Palestinians to build in Area C, the roughly two-thirds of the West Bank where its prohibited., If Netanyahu acts in those positive ways, then Obama should  let Secretary of State Kerry try to relaunch negotiations, Indyk said. If not, then Obama will have no choice but to act to preserve the two-state solution through a U.N. Security Council resolution that lays out the principles of an agreement., Does a U.N. resolution matter that much? Bibi would do anything to avoid that, said David Makovsky, an Israel expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. It opens the door to international sanctions against Israel in the future., Thats the direction the administration appears to be heading. Last week, White House and State Department spokesmen pointedly said that the United States is reconsidering whether it should support a U.N. resolution outlining the terms of an Israel-Palestine deal., On Obamas front burner, however, is protecting a nuclear deal with Iran  if his negotiators can get one. Administration officials expect that Netanyahu will denounce any achievable agreement with Tehran, just as he did in his speech to Congress earlier this month. And that could encourage congressional efforts to block or delay a deal., But Netanyahus intemperate campaign statements, followed by his retractions, has given the administration some room to maneuver. If the Israeli leader denounces a nuclear deal, you can expect U.S. officials to say, in effect, You cant believe a word that man says. Indeed, they already are pointing out that Netanyahu denounced an earlier, interim nuclear deal with Iran  one that other Israeli officials say turned out pretty well. Such tough talk suggests that the chill between Obama and Netanyahu will get worse before it gets better., One more factor presages a rough road ahead: the gathering presidential campaign. Republican candidates already are competing to demonstrate support for Netanyahu and opposition to Obama  to out-Bibi Bibi. (That leaves the leading Democratic candidate, Hillary Rodham Clinton, uncomfortably in the middle. Shes been studiously quiet, a luxury she wont be able to enjoy if she ever declares her candidacy.) Thats likely to intensify Obamas impulse to jab back., Were we talking about peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians? Maybe its time for peace talks between Israel and the United States, too., doyle.mcmanus@latimes.com, Twitter:@DoyleMcManus, Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinionandFacebook]", "Date": "20150320", "Title": "[After Netanyahu's reelection, tough love and damage control by the U.S.]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0322-mcmanus-netanyahu-israel-obama-20150322-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}

But I cant.\", It was a message deliberately targeted to African leaders who all too often refuse to abide by their own countries presidential term limits, most of which were put in place at the urging of Western powers. More than a half-dozen countries have simply repealed term-limit laws to allow sitting presidents to remain., This week, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, in power since 1987, likened the two-term limit to a rope around the neck for African leaders. He dismissed term limits as a Western concept that doesnt work on the continent, even though his nation adopted two five-year terms limits in 2013., ------------, July 28, 3:56 p.m.: An earlier version of this article referred to Mwai Kibaki as Daniel Arap Mois predecessor.

He is arguing that because his first election came through parliament, not a direct vote of the people, it didnt count as his first term., Facing pressure to step down after his second term in 2016, President Joseph Kabila failed to change term-limits law amid violent protests and then delayed setting an election date. A vote is now scheduled for November 2016., Former Kenyan big man Daniel Arap Moi won international praise in 2002 for stepping down after 24 years, following Kenyas adoption of term limits. His successor, Mwai Kibaki, also served two terms., Paul Kagame took control after the 1994 genocide, but wasnt officially elected until 2003 under the new constitution that limits the president to two seven-year terms. His test will come in 2017., Nelson Mandela was elected in 1994, stepping down after one term in hopes of setting a good example, even though by law he could have run again., In office since 1986, Yoweri Museveni in 2005 repealed a clause in the constitution that imposed two-term limits.

{"Content": "[[, When Rand Paul began charting his presidential run, the Ray-Ban-wearing senator and heir apparent to a libertarian legacy rebranded himself to suit more mainstream Republican tastes., He rejected his famous fathers isolationist foreign policy, voted for more military spending and even campaigned in front of an aircraft carrier. He invited a Christian broadcasting network into his home and spoke against gay marriage, famously pronouncing himself libertarian-ish., But it turned out that Rand Paul 2.0 had a glitch: Appeal was limited., After flatlining in the polls and lagging rivals in fundraising, Pauls campaign heeded a market lesson repeatedly applied in American politics. They brought back the original., The Kentucky senator has pivoted back to his familiar stomping grounds among the outliers of Republican politics., In May he infuriated some fellow Republicans by delivering a 10-hour speech to protest Patriot Act provisions on NSA domestic spying. Last month he became the first presidential candidate to openly court money from the legalized marijuana industry and shared a moment with Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, known for his standoff with federal agents in 2014 and for his divisive comments about minorities., Out of necessity hes moving back to his base, which is a sign the strategy he adopted was the wrong strategy, said Aaron Day, chairman of the New Hampshire chapter of the Republican Liberty Caucus, a nationwide libertarian-leaning organization within the GOP. He needs the grass-roots and they know this now., Rands campaign denied any rebooting of his message or positions, and insisted that he never intended to replicate the campaigns of his father, the former Texas GOP congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul. There has been no change, no pivot, said campaign manager Chip Englander. He has the same view hes always had., But as Paul tried to navigate a more crowd-pleasing course, he ended up in no-mans land, disappointing core activists while failing to generate enthusiasm from the partys mainstream., The result left him on an island, said one strategist from a rival Republican campaign who did not want to be identified speaking about Paul. Hes played this footsie game with  the establishment for so long and you can see him make this pivot back., The challenge now facing Paul in the crowded GOP field is whether he can reignite the spark among libertarians who feel betrayed by his shifts, without alienating those Republicans potentially receptive to his call for limited government., Thats the line he has to walk here, said Tom Rath, a Republican strategist in New Hampshire. He strays too far and you get people saying, Who are you?, The stakes are even higher as other candidates pile into the race, eager to portray Pauls libertarian-leaning views as extreme. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, in particular, is targeting Paul on the campaign trail, saying the senators filibuster-like maneuver, which temporarily prevented the National Security Agency from accessing Americans telephone records, resulted in a dangerous surveillance lapse that put the country at risk., Fundraising for Paul has been lackluster, especially because his team has not lassoed a big-dollar donor like the billionaires bankrolling other candidates., The campaign reported $7 million for the quarter ended June 30, compared with about $14 million for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), $12 million for Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and $11 million for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. A \"super PAC\" backing Paul had hoped that his marathon Patriot Act speech would produce a high-value Silicon Valley donor, but one has failed to materialize., So, while outside groups for Bush pushed his overall second-quarter haul to more than $114 million, followed by Cruz at $52 million and Rubio at $44 million, the main super PAC supporting Paul has not yet released its fundraising totals., Pauls campaign acknowledges that his libertarian base is his top priority even as he tries to build a new coalition, much the way President Obama turned out first-time younger voters and minorities. That means that even as Paul popped into a West Michigan happy hour with tea party Congressman Justin Amash, he also spent time in Detroit with African American civic leaders, taking our message to places where the GOP usually doesnt go, said campaign spokesman Sergio Gor., With 15 GOP candidates already in the race, Pauls campaign is betting its better to be loved by a few than liked by many, particularly in a fractured field., But recapturing the imagination of libertarian-leaning voters who have grown skeptical of Paul is proving more difficult. In New Hampshire, a state that Pauls campaign hopes will catapult his bid, the liberty caucus leaders are openly fretting that celebrity candidate Donald Trump has emerged as a top of choice for many in their wing, a concern also raised by some in Nevada, once prime Paul territory., Pauls May talk-a-thon against the governments surveillance program went a long way toward restoring his appeal and reenergize fans, and his new flat-tax proposal could please both mainstream and tea party camps in the GOP. But his June marijuana industry fundraiser in Denver, where pot entrepreneurs paid a minimum of $2,700 to hear him speak, may not go over well with Republicans in Iowa, who tend to be more socially conservative. His friendly rapport with rancher Bundy who once speculated that the Negro was better off under slavery could give voters pause in other states., Theres going to be some trickiness in satisfying everyone who was your fathers supporter, said Craig Robinson, a former Iowa Republican Party political director who now runs a popular blog. When you start going down those libertarian rabbit trails too far, its going to be trouble., Polling shows that Paul still ranks in the top 10 among the Republican presidential hopefuls; he tied for second behind Trump earlier this month in an Economist/YouGov poll. His campaign points to other surveys showing him competitive with Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton, beating her in Iowa in a Quinnipiac University poll shortly after he announced his candidacy in April., Nick Gillespie, editor of the libertarian Reason.com, said Paul does best when he stakes out classic libertarian positions to distinguish himself from the other candidates., All of the moments where he stands out where he captures not just the political imagination, but the public American imagination are the most libertarian,Gillespie said., Twitter: @lisamascaro, MORE ON NATIONAL POLITICS:, Scott Walker tries to prove hes a national contender for president, Jeb Bush, in San Francisco visit, says Trump is preying on immigration fears, How much money have presidential candidates raised in California?]", "Date": "20150717", "Title": "[After sagging in fundraising, Rand Paul 2.0 reboots campaign ]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-rand-paul-2016-reboot-campaign-20150717-story.html", "Author": "[Lisa Mascaro]"}
{"Content": "[[, When Rick Perry made a late entry into the 2012 presidential race, he quickly surged to the top of the crowded Republican field., It turned out to be the high point of his candidacy., Less than three weeks after the voting started, the Texas governor unceremoniously quit the contest, becoming an object of derision for a bumbling debate performance and the flailing exclamation -- \"Oops!\" -- that served as a punch line to his hapless campaign., As Perry officially launched another try for the White House on Thursday, he has become something of an afterthought, trailing another large pack of 2016 hopefuls even though, by most accounts, he is a much-improved candidate from four years ago., Rather than jumping headlong into the contest and swaggering his way through appearances, he has set about a serious course of study in domestic and foreign affairs. No longer peering down from atop opinion polls, he has waged a humbler, more accessible campaign, focused in particular on Iowa, where Perry has shaken hands and backslapped his way from one small town to the next, winning strong reviews in the process., \"This is a guy who honestly admits the mistakes of his last race,\" said Craig Robinson, whose website, the Iowa Republican, closely chronicles events in the state that will cast the first 2016 ballots. \"I think that goes a long way.\", On Thursday, Perry,a former Air Force pilot, used a C-130 as a backdrop inside an airport hangar in the suburbs north of Dallas as he touted the states economic expansion and cited his humble upbringing in rural Texas., Ive seen American life from the red dirt of a West Texas cotton field, from a campus in College Station, from the elevated view of a C-130 cockpit, and from the governors office of the Texas Capitol, said Perry, the longest serving governor in the states history., He was joined on stage by several military veterans, who before Perrys speech lauded his service and commitment to the armed forces., Perry avoided criticizing the wide field of GOP presidential candidates, but assailed President Obama on issues foreign and domestic., I want to share some important truths with my fellow Americans, starting with this truth -- we dont have to settle for a world in chaos or an America that shrinks from its responsibilities, Perry said. We dont have to apologize for American exceptionalism, or Western values., But there is one other significant and potentially more consequential difference from the last time Perry ran: Even as he took the stage outside Dallas to announce his candidacy, he remains under indictment here in the state capital, accused of abusing his power as governor to undermine Texas political ethics agency., Attorneys for Perry, who left office in January, have fought hard to have the two felony charges tossed out of court, saying they were politically motivated and wrongly seek to criminalize Perrys legitimate conduct. But the presiding judge  a Republican  has refused to dismiss the case, leaving the indictment to hang menacingly over Perrys campaign., \"Its not on peoples minds at this point,\" said Jim Henson, who directs the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin. \"But the fact it hasnt been dismissed does suggest that the idea that it was frivolous and completely manufactured has not been persuasive in court thus far.\", The case revolves around Travis County Dist. Atty. Rosemary Lehmberg and stems from her April 2013 arrest on drunken driving charges., Lehmberg pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, paid a $4,000 fine and served about half of a 45-day jail sentence. She said she would not seek reelection in 2016. But she refused Perrys demand that she immediately resign; he, in turn, followed through on a veto threat and slashed $7.5 million in funding for the states public integrity unit, which is housed in the Travis County district attorneys office., The office has a history of tense relations with Republicans who run the state  Lehmberg is a Democrat  and a number of politically sensitive investigations were eventually dropped for lack of funding., A government watchdog group, Texans for Public Justice, filed a complaint, and an independent prosecutor was appointed to investigate. Perry was indicted in August on charges of abuse of official power and coercion of a public servant., After a blaze of publicity  including a nationally broadcast news conference in which the governor defended his actions and fiercely denounced the charges  the case has settled into the workaday grind of the legal process., In January, state District Judge Bert Richardsonrejected a defense bid to dismiss the case on constitutional grounds, though he questioned some of the wording in the criminal charges. Attorneys for the former governor have appealed the decision., ------------, FOR THE RECORD, June 4, 10 a.m.: An earlier version of this articlemisidentified state District Judge Bert Richardson as U.S. District Judge Bert Robinson., ------------, The case rarely seems to come up as Perry campaigns before Republican audiences around the country., \"I havent heard two people mention it,\" said Tom Rath, a longtime GOP strategist in New Hampshire, which immediately follows Iowa on the 2016 election calendar. \"I think most consider it some kind of political tug of war and dont expect anything to come of it.\", That is not to say, however, the indictment has not exacted a toll; Perry has so far spent more than $1 million in campaign funds on his legal defense., Staff writer Kurtis Lee contributed to this report., Twitter: @markzbarabak, ALSO:, Local politicians profit from presidential hopefuls in early-voting states, State Senate OKs measures on immigrant healthcare, e-cigarettes, Mystery tar balls could affect Southern Californias beloved grunion, 10:22 a.m.: This article has been updated with comments from Perrys announcement., 7:16 a.m.: This article has been updated to reflect the launch of Perrys campaign., This article was originally published at 3 a.m.]", "Date": "20150604", "Title": "[Rick Perry, humble and under indictment, announces second White House run]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-rick-perry-2016-20150604-story.html", "Author": "[Mark Z.

{"Content": "[[, When the nations largest Spanish-language television network cut ties just over a week ago with Donald Trump, Univision executives said they were acting out of \"a responsibility to speak up for the community we serve.\", \"We see firsthand the work ethic, love for family, strong religious values and the important role Mexican immigrants ... have in building the future of our country,\" the network said in response to Trumps derogatory comments about Mexican immigrants., It was a characteristic move for Univision, which, like many Spanish-language media outlets in the U.S., defines itself not just as a media company but as an advocate and defender of the Latino community., \"They openly acknowledge their bias in acting in the interest of Hispanic America,\" said Fernand Amandi, a Democratic pollster based in Florida., That self-assigned role could have big consequences for next years presidential election. With a record 28 million Latinos eligible to vote, Spanish-language media companies are set to have their greatest impact yet in shaping a presidential race. Their advocacy stance has been on display as the campaign heats up, with reporters grilling candidates on issues of special importance to the Latino community, especially immigration., \"If the Spanish-language media has five minutes to talk to a presidential candidate about anything, they will talk about immigration,\" said Gabriela Domenzain, a former Univision producer who is now advising Democratic presidential hopeful Martin OMalley. Thats partly because reporters for English-language outlets often touch on the issue in less detail, if at all, she said., In a recent interview on a Spanish-language show, OMalley focused entirely on his proposals to help the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally. The topic didnt come up at all in an interview OMalley did that same day with ABCs George Stephanopoulos., \"We try to amplify the issues that maybe the mainstream media is not covering,\" said Juan Varela, vice president for content at ImpreMedia, which publishes many of the nations leading Spanish-language newspapers, including La Opinion in Los Angeles. \"We have more responsibility than other journalists,\" he said. \"We are a part of this community, and we have a responsibility to support our people and to help to integrate them.\", That approach has provoked objections from some in both parties, but especially Republicans who see the focus on immigration and the activist stance of many Latino journalists as helpful to Democrats., Univision anchor Jorge Ramos, probably the best-known Latino journalist in the country, has been a particular target. He recently defended the focus on immigration in an open letter to Republicans., \"The Republican Party has been complaining lately about how some Latino journalists, including me, only ask them about immigration,\" he said. \"That is correct, but what Republicans dont understand is that for us, the immigration issue is the most pressing symbolically and emotionally, and the stance a politician takes on this defines whether he is with us or against us.\", Ramos, who is one of the most trusted public figures among American Latinos, according to polls, has been an outspoken supporter of federal legislation that would pave a path to citizenship for those living in the country illegally., He has pressed candidates from both parties on the issue. In the 2012 campaign, he hammered President Obama, who had promised but failed to deliver an immigration bill during his first term. More recently, he has criticized Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio, who as a senator from Florida helped write an immigration reform bill but dropped support for it after it drew conservative anger., Conservatives stepped up their critique of Ramos last month after the news anchor announced that his daughter was working for Hillary Rodham Clintons campaign for the Democratic nomination. Other criticism has focused on the close relationship between Clinton and Haim Saban, one of the owners of Univision and a longtime Clinton fundraiser., Conservatives say excessive attention to immigration overshadows other issues that matter to Latino voters., \"Immigration shouldnt be the sole prism\" through which campaigns are covered, said Ken Oliver-Mendez, director of Media Resource Center Latino, a conservative group that monitors Spanish-language news for perceived political bias., ------------, FOR THE RECORD, The correct name of the group headed by Ken Oliver-Mendez is MRC Latino., -------------, According to polls, candidates plans for the economy, healthcare and education are more important to Latino voters than immigration, he said. Those issues deserve more play, he added, along with candidates views on social issues like abortion and gay marriage., But some criticism also comes from the liberal end of the spectrum., After Jeb Bush announced his candidacy for the GOP nomination last month, many newscasts noted the Latino musicians who performed, Bushs fluent Spanish and his wifes Mexican heritage., \"This focus on biographical details has come at the expense of reporting on Bushs positions on healthcare and climate change  issues on which his positions are at odds with the interests of most Latinos,\" wrote Jessica Torres, a researcher at Media Matters, a liberal media-watchdog group., Her organization found that immigration was discussed nearly nine times more than jobs and the economy and 26 times more than education on several Spanish-language newscasts during a recent five-month period. Healthcare was never discussed on those shows during that period, according to the report., When candidates dont address Latinos specifically, Spanish-language reporters are apt to take note., When Univision covered Kentucky Sen. Rand Pauls announcement that he was seeking the GOP nomination, for example, a reporter mentioned a few highlights of the speech and one thing the senator had left out., \"In an important detail, Rand Paul didnt mention the theme of immigration  or the term Hispanic,\" journalist Pablo Gato reported., So several candidates are already courting Latinos via Spanish-language media outlets in heavily Hispanic swing states., Bush, a former governor of Florida, has appeared on local Spanish-language television affiliates in that state. In a recent swing through Nevada, he used a Spanish-language interview to criticize Trump, several days before he commented about the controversy in English., Last month, Clinton published an op-ed translated into Spanish in a small Latino newspaper in Nevada. In the piece, Clinton reiterated a pledge to do more than Obama to protect immigrants in the country illegally from deportation., Ibra Morales, president of MundoFox, a Spanish-language TV company, said his network planned to expand its campaign coverage to focus on education, housing and the war in Iraq, along with immigration. \"The Latino agenda is the American agenda,\" he said., But as Univision News president Isaac Lee explained at a forum at the University of Texas at Austin earlier this year, reporters for Spanish-language stations will continue to define themselves as both journalists and advocates., \"Univisions audience knows that Jorge is representing them,\" Lee said, referring to Ramos. \"He is not asking the questions to be celebrated as a fair and balanced journalist. Hes asking the questions to represent them. Hes going to ask the person whatever is necessary to push the agenda for a more fair society, for a more inclusive society and for the Hispanic community to be better.\", kate.linthicum@latimes.com, Twitter:@katelinthicum]", "Date": "20150706", "Title": "[Latino media double down on immigration advocacy, and GOP candidates aren't pleased]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/immigration/la-na-latino-media-20150704-story.html", "Author": "[Kate Linthicum]"}
{"Content": "[[, When the Supreme Court issued its ruling this week in the Hobby Lobby contraception case, there was no end of commentary amid a wall-to-wall unfurling of predictable response: Conservatives celebrated the 5-4 decision as a triumph for religious freedom. Liberals denounced it as an assault on the rights of women., Perhaps the most curious and surprising reaction came from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, whose response was, essentially, no response., The fact is that when youre an executive, your Supreme Court makes a ruling and youve got to live with it unless you can get the legislative body to change the law or change the Constitution, Christie offered by way of a Politics 101 explication on CNBCs Squawk Box., The point is, why should I give an opinion as to whether they were right or wrong? the prospective 2016 Republican presidential hopeful continued. At the end of the day, they did what they did. Thats now the law of the land, unless people in the legislative branch try to change it., When speculation began about a possible Christie White House bid, handicappers focused on the governors blowtorch persona and his vociferous and opinionated style of public engagement, a soundtrack that includes any number of loud, in-your-face arias., \"I am not a focus-group-tested, blow-dried candidate, or governor,\" the acutely self-aware Christie said at an epic January news conference, in which he repeatedly apologized for staffers who tied up roads leading to the George Washington Bridge, apparently to punish a small-town mayor for refusing to endorse Christies reelection bid., Given that verity, few expected much reticence on the outspoken governors part., Yet since emerging from his self-imposed media exile  Christie spent several weeks traveling the country but ducking reporters after the bridge scandal broke  he has adopted an unusually closed-mouth stance on certain difficult questions hed likely face in a presidential run., Appearing last month in San Francisco, Christie was asked to outline his position on immigration, which, perhaps more than any issue, threatens to sunder the GOP., Im sure youd love me to do that and, in fact, what I want to do in a flower warehouse, I want to give you a very complex answer behind a set of microphones on a contentious issue thats driving debate all across the country, Christie replied., The sarcastic response got a laugh from the several dozen Republican activists who showed up at the floral business to cheer Christie and the GOPs California gubernatorial nominee, Neel Kashkari., Christie was even more dismissive when a reporter asked about revelations that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the agency at the center of the bridge scandal, was being probed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, one of a tangle of ongoing investigations., Any other questions? he asked, turning away from his questioner., That got snickers, too., The bridge scandal came up again on MSNBC on Tuesday, drawing a breezy Christie dismissal. \"I think what the people across this country  and Ive been in 19 states now over the past four or five months or so  and what people talk to me about is not that stuff, said the governor, who has strenuously and repeatedly denied any involvement in last years deliberate traffic tie-up., Christie treads a difficult path as he eyes a White House bid. He is a relative social moderate in a party with a voter base that remains deeply conservative; that would explain why he prefers to downplay issues like abortion and access to contraception, even as some competitors were quick to hail the Hobby Lobby decision., The high court ruled Monday that business owners who have religious objections to birth control, like the owners of Hobby Lobby, can decline to provide their employees with insurance coverage for certain contraceptives, despite a requirement under the new federal healthcare law., \"I dont think thats the most central issue that we need to talk about this morning when you look at the challenges that face this country,\" Christie said in the Squawk Box interview. \"If I allow people to put me in the box, then shame on me. Im not a good politician. Im not a good leader.\", That sort of evasion might work, but only for a time., Reporters, as a class, are held in generally low regard by much of the public, especially partisans who believe they unfairly slant political coverage in favor of the other side. (A neat trick, managing to displease both.) So ignoring or even belittling a pesky questioner can seem like great sport and might even help among at least a certain segment of the electorate., But its not just reporters who are being stiff-armed; its the voters who rely on their coverage to cast an informed ballot., It is early in the presidential campaign, with the first voting still 18 months or so away.

Tsai, a 58-year-old lawyer and member of the Democratic Progressive Party, will face Hung Hsiu-chu, 67, a former teacher who was nominated Sunday by the ruling Nationalist Party., Backed by Taiwans ruling Nationalist Party members, Hung Hsiu-chu waves a flag as she is nominated for president on July 19 in Taipei., Backed by Taiwans ruling Nationalist Party members, Hung Hsiu-chu waves a flag as she is nominated for president on July 19 in Taipei., The looming matchup, observers say, signals that Taiwanese can handily accept women at the helm, a reflection of traditional social values as well as modern political advances., I think Taiwan is better prepared for female leadership than even the U.S., said Joanna Lei, chief executive of the Chunghua 21st Century Think Tank in Taiwan., Weve had a long matriarchic tradition, Lei said. In ancient days, when they reached their 50s and 60s, women became the senior people, often the commanding power of their clan and family. Female leadership is not alien to Asian culture., In the Philippines, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo was president from 2001 to 2010, and in 2013, Park Geun-hye took office as South Koreas first female president. Both India and Pakistan have had female prime ministers: Indira Gandhi led India for 15 years and was in office when she was assassinated in 1984; Benazir Bhutto served two terms at Pakistans helm in the 1980s and 90s, and was assassinated in 2007., Unlike most Asian female presidents, Tsai and Hung did not build their names on the fame of their fathers or a decorated family history. They earned it through seniority, popularity and promotions within their parties., Hung has served as deputy legislative speaker for nearly four years and has a reputation for sharpness in grilling Cabinet ministers who appear before the parliament. Local news media describe her as fierce, feisty or just plain funny., Tsai has chaired her party for two stints over five years and served as Taiwans top policymaker on China affairs in the mid-2000s. She is known for bridging deep factional divides and acerbically attacking Hungs party. She has earned recognition abroad for her speeches in fluent English, which she learned in part while studying in the United States and Britain., Ten women work as heads of central government departments in Taiwan, compared with 76 men. In 2010 Taiwan implemented a law to promote gender equality, requiring that a quarter of city and county councils of four or more people be female. Political analysts say the quotas are easily being met today., Taiwan is more politically mature than foreigners can ever imagine, said Liu Yi-jiun, a public affairs professor at Fo Guang University in Taiwan. Only about 2% of Taiwanese, mostly older people, oppose female leadership, Liu said, based on his own research., The race is primarily expected to be fought over issues such as relations with mainland China and the steep cost of living for Taiwans youth. Tsai has a tenuous lead in opinion polls. The election will take place Jan. 16., Tsai supports dialogue with China, though her party lacks a framework for negotiations that Beijing is likely to accept., Taiwan has been self-ruled since the 1940s, when Chiang Kai-sheks Nationalists lost the Chinese civil war to the Communists and relocated to the island. China insists that the two sides eventually reunite, though polls say most Taiwanese prefer separation., The Nationalists ran an authoritarian government until 1987, when then-President Chiang Ching-kuo lifted 38 years of martial law to introduce democracy. Tsais party was established in the 1980s, after years of political persecution, to vie with the Nationalists., Under Nationalist President Ma Ying-jeou, in office since 2008, ties between mainland China and Taiwan have warmed. The two sides have signed 21 economic agreements. Ma agreed to negotiate with Beijing on the basis that both sides belong to a single China, though the two sides hold different interpretations of exactly what that means., Tsais party rejects that basis for talks, and the public has shown increasing doubt about Mas engagement policies.

{"Content": "[[, While Donald Trump has kept the political world transfixed, Hillary Rodham Clinton has spent her summer methodically rolling out a long list of policy proposals. They add up to a platform you might call \"soft populism.\" Its not the insurrectionist socialism of Bernie Sanders but still progressive enough to keep most Democratic primary voters on her side., Clinton has offered talking points on economic growth, income stagnation, small business, college costs, immigration, criminal justice reform, climate change  and a few other things beside., But theres one big item missing from her agenda so far, a wonky but important issue that Democrats neglect at their peril: reforming the federal government. Or, to borrow a slogan from the Democrats 1992 presidential candidate, Bill Clinton: \"reinventing government.\", Its no mystery why voters are in an angry mood this year. Like Trump and Sanders, many of them believe the political system is broken and the government doesnt work. A Pew Research Center poll found last year that only 24% of Americans trust the federal government to do the right thing most of the time., Clinton agrees, at least in principle. \"Our political system is so paralyzed by gridlock and dysfunction that most Americans have lost confidence that anything can actually get done,\" she said when she announced her candidacy in June., She also said she wanted to make the federal bureaucracy \"smarter, simpler [and] more efficient.\" But thats the last time she talked about government reform. A long memo to supporters last week from her campaign manager, Robby Mook, didnt mention the topic at all., Meanwhile, in her policy speeches, Clinton has talked up an activist role for the federal government: creating jobs through infrastructure spending, shaping corporate behavior through tax incentives, revamping the college loan system, funding preschool education., Those ideas should all play well in a Democratic primary campaign. But to win a general election, a Democrat also needs to convince less-partisan voters that the federal government is capable of spending their tax money wisely, or that it can be made to by a determined president., Skeptical voters, especially white working-class ones, \"are open to an expansive Democratic economic agenda  to more benefits for child care and higher education, to tax hikes on the wealthy, to investment in infrastructure spending,\" Stanley B. Greenberg, chief pollster for the 1992 Clinton campaign, wrote in a recent memo for the Democratic Strategist. \"Yet they are only ready to listen when they think that Democrats understand their deeply held belief that politics has been corrupted and government has failed,\" he warned. \"Everything they have seen says that government is gridlocked and is bought and paid for by big donors and special interests.... Championing reform of government and the political process is the price of admission with these voters.\", Greenberg has urged Clinton and other Democrats to talk about streamlining the federal government even before they talk about new programs  \"reform first.\", \"When voters hear the reform narrative first, they are then dramatically more open to  calls for government activism in response to Americas problems,\" he wrote., But so far, Clinton is doing the opposite. Shes rolling out big-government proposals first and leaving the wonky stuff of government reform for later., Theres also a substantive reason to embrace government reform, of course: Its good policy., The federal government hasnt undergone a full-scale overhaul since Bill Clinton launched his \"reinventing government\" crusade 22 years ago. His successors, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, didnt abandon government reform, but they never made it a high-priority goal, and it showed. Some of Obamas worst moments as president have resulted from his administrations neglect of the workaday machinery of government: the collapse of the Obamacare website in 2013, the scandal over mismanagement of Veterans Affairs hospitals in 2014., \"This needs to stay on her list,\" argued William A. Galston of the Brookings Institution, another veteran of the first Clinton administration. \"The voting public doesnt think the U.S. government is working very well, and the voting public is right.\", Galston said Clinton could begin by proposing broad-scale regulatory reform, to steal a favorite issue from Republicans, and an effort to unsnarl the federal governments byzantine contracting rules., \"When the Obamacare website was being built, the federal government didnt have access to some of the best firms because its contracting practices are so cumbersome,\" Galston noted. \"Thats one of the reasons several states performed so much better.\", Or she could go big  and propose a 21st century version of her husbands ambitious attempt to make the federal government innovative, agile and customer-friendly., The Democratic front-runner already has all the disadvantages of running for office as a Clinton, from controversies over foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation to the consequences of her ill-advised decision to store official emails on a private server. She might as well take advantage of the successful parts of her husbands legacy too., doyle.mcmanus@latimes.com, Twitter: @doylemcmanus, Follow the Opinion section on Twitter@latimesopinion and Facebook]", "Date": "20150816", "Title": "[Can Hillary Clinton win the angry voters?]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0816-mcmanus-hillary-clinton-government-reform-20150816-column.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, While much of the nation is preoccupied with Obamacare and picking new health insurance at work, older Americans have deadlines of their own coming up  involving Medicare., Were just a few days away from the two-month period when the nations 54 million Medicare beneficiaries have a chance to change their Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plans., Every year, seniors should review their options and compare plans even if theyre happy with their current coverage. Experts want people to avoid being surprised after its too late to change. The deadline is Dec. 7., The process of shopping can be daunting, and many seniors simply dont heed the advice., \"Its the same advice we give every year, but its hard to get people off the dime,\" says Ross Blair, senior vice president of eHealthMedicare.com, which provides tools and information on Medicare insurance issues., Yet Blair says millions of people will see the cost of their current plans increase next year, even if just a little. \"That can add up when youre on a fixed income,\" he says., Retired teacher Pat Kersbergen, 74, of Upland got a jump start on her shopping. She has Medicare and buys a separate drug plan to help cover the cost of her prescription medications., She says she didnt bother comparing plans during last years election period, which left her without any coverage for one of her medications. This year, she wont make the same mistake., \"Im going to find out the best drug plan for me,\" she says., But figuring out which plan that is can be more complicated than it sounds, Kersbergen says., \"I can save approximately $20 per month on the premium with one of the plans that does include all my necessary drugs. But Ill need to work with quantity limits or spend $20 more for a different plan, have all my drugs on the formulary, but then would have to change pharmacies,\" she says., Experts offer recommendations when shopping for Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plans., Medicare Advantage plans. Nearly 16 million people  or about 30% of the Medicare population  are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans. These cover hospitalization, outpatient care and, often, prescription-drug coverage under one plan., According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the average premium for Medicare Advantage plans will increase less than $3 next year, to $33.90 per month. Residents of Los Angeles County will see average costs of just $13.74 per month. The vast majority of enrollees will face little or no premium increase for next year., But out-of-pocket costs, such as deductibles and co-pays, are expected to rise. Looking beyond the monthly premium will be important for shoppers wanting to save money., In some cases, insurers are consolidating the number of plans they offer. This year nationwide, \"2 million people are affected by plan terminations, and about 380,000 will actually have to change carriers because the insurer is no longer offering anything in their service area,\" Blair says., Pay attention to networks, experts stress. Medicare Advantage plans are also reducing the size of their provider networks  in some cases quite dramatically., If your physician will no longer be participating in your current plan, your insurer is required to send you notice of that fact and help you find another doctor in the network., Ronald Bolding, CEO of Pomona-based Inter Valley Health Plan, a nonprofit Medicare Advantage plan, says people need to be alert. Look at available doctors, hospitals and pharmacies. \"It should be clearly evident in the directories, but admittedly it may take a little work to figure it out,\" he says., Prescription drug plans. Medicare Part D plans cover prescription drugs that basic Medicare does not., Nationwide, the average monthly premium in 2015 will be about $31, the federal government estimates. In California the figures vary, but the average is $58.91., Although the number of these plans has dropped for 2015, there will still be 1,000 available nationwide. In Los Angeles County, Medicare participants will have 31 plans from which to choose for 2015, down from 34 this year., As with Medicare Advantage plans, insurers are shifting more costs onto beneficiaries in the form of higher out-of-pocket costs, such as deductibles, co-pays and co-insurance, so you need to look beyond premiums., Experts urge consumers to be alert for possible changes since last years Medicare Advantage and prescription plans., They say its critical to make sure the medications you take are on a plans list of covered drugs. And watch out for restrictions, such as the need to fill prescriptions at in-network pharmacies, get prior authorizations or try generic drugs before a brand name will be covered., Also, many plans have \"preferred\" status pharmacies, whose costs can be lower than other in-network pharmacies, says Elaine Wong Eakin, executive director of the Medicare advocacy organization California Health Advocates. In fact, 70% of Medicare drug plans had preferred pharmacy networks this year, and the expectation is there will be more in 2015., Also, pay attention to the ratings. To help consumers determine the value of both Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plans, Medicare created a quality rating system. A plan can receive one to five stars, with five being the best, based on the agencys assessment of medical services and customer satisfaction., \"We encourage consumers to look for high-performance plans, and these are plans with more stars,\" Wong Eakin says., Consider passing on any with less than 3.5 stars, experts say., Based on her own comparison of drug plans, Kersbergen, the retired teacher from Upland, also cautions shoppers to pay close attention to the details., \"The less expensive plan had higher drug co-payments than the more expensive one. So an individual taking several medications could conceivably have higher out-of-pocket expenses per month with the less expensive premium plan.\", Resources, To review your plan options: Medicare plan finder at http://www.medicare.gov or call (800) MEDICARE; eHealthMedicare.com., For free personalized counseling services: State Health Insurance Assistance Programs, shipnpr.shiptalk.org or call (800) 677-1116; In Los Angeles, California Health Advocates: http://www.cahealthadvocates.org/HICAP, healthcare@latimes.com, Zamosky is the author of \"Healthcare, Insurance, and You: The Savvy Consumers Guide.\"]", "Date": "20141012", "Title": "[How to judge Medicare plans]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-healthcare-watch-20141012-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, While not exactly motherhood or apple pie, stopping the spread of communicable diseases would seem to be the rare issue that transcends political differences, even in these fiercely partisan times., But the debate that arose this week over childhood vaccinations and the rights of parents underscored the way science has moved from the realm of objectivity and empirical study to a far more fractious and emotional battlefield., The vaccination issue, tied to an outbreak of measles at Disneyland, fails to cleave neatly along party lines. Some Republicans, including several possible 2016 candidates, were quick to join Democrats in urging parents to vaccinate their children  though they fell notably short of urging a government mandate., There is a lot of fear-mongering out there on this, said Republican Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. I think it is irresponsible for leaders to undermine the publics confidence in vaccinations that have been tested and proven to protect public health., Others in the prospective Republican field echoed his statement, including Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida., Still, the issue opened up divisions within the GOP and among its White House hopefuls and played to an image Democrats are eager to promote, of the Republican Party and its candidates as divorced from reality, anti-science and, by extension, retrograde and anti-progress., The science is clear, Hillary Rodham Clinton, the front-runner for Democrats 2016 presidential nomination, sarcastically stated via Twitter. The earth is round, the sky is blue, and #vaccineswork. Lets protect all our kids., The debate began when President Obama, in a pre-Super Bowl interview, urged parents to vaccinate their children against measles, calling the supporting science pretty indisputable., Weve looked at this again and again, Obama told NBC News on Sunday. There is every reason to get vaccinated., The next day, two 2016 Republican prospects took issue with the president, appealing to the innate skepticism of many Republicans toward anything suggesting government control., New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who is seeking to broaden his appeal among conservatives, said parents need to have some measure of choice about vaccinating their children  though he quickly retracted the statement after sharp criticism., Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a champion of limited government, went further., Vaccinations should be a personal decision, he told conservative radio host Laura Ingraham. Later, when pressed on CNBC, Paul said that he believed the decision was a matter of individual liberty. More provocatively, the senator, who has a medical degree, said he heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines., Similar assertions have been debunked by scientific research, and on Tuesday, Paul issued his own recantation, saying he supports vaccines; he also Tweeted a picture of himself getting a booster shot., Even so, the controversy suggests anew that the days of science as the publics impartial arbiter are tenuous, yielding to partisan impulses that have pushed the two parties and their elected leaders far apart., In 2009, when the science was less clear than today, Democrats and Republicans roughly agreed on the merits of vaccination, with more than 7 in 10 in both parties believing the shots should be mandatory, according to a Pew Research poll. A survey last year found that support had grown to 76% among Democrats and dropped to 65% among Republicans., A starker example of the partisan divide over science is global warming., A spring 2014 poll by Yale University found nearly 9 in 10 Democrats believe global warming is happening  a phenomenon supported by the overwhelming weight of scientific evidence  compared with fewer than 3 in 10 conservative Republicans, who hold considerable sway in the presidential nominating process., Anthony Leiserowitz, who directs the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication, said personal values greatly influence the way people perceive scientific issues., Those who believe strongly in individual autonomy  often conservatives  oppose the collective action needed to address global warming, so they question the science behind calls for personal sacrifice, Leiserowitz said. Similarly, those who are suspicious of big corporations  often liberals  oppose nuclear power generation and genetically modified food, even though extensive scientific research has concluded that both are safe when done properly., The messenger also drives political attitudes, Leiserowitz said, noting that the more closely the global warming issue was tied to Al Gore, the former Democratic vice president, the more Republican skepticism grew., The politicizing of science is nothing new, as Roger Pielke, an author and University of Colorado environmental studies professor, pointed out. President Nixon overrode the wishes of NASA experts and timed the Apollo 17 launch to boost his 1972 reelection bid. President Carter ignored his science advisors when he put solar panels on the roof of the White House, as a public relations move. (President Reagan removed them when he took office; President Obama put them back.), The vaccine controversy may soon pass.

And he probably should be. He desires higher office, and this is likely his best shot., Billionaire climate-change activist Tom Steyer, 57, probably wont run. And he probably shouldnt. Theres a long history of failure in California for mega-rich political neophytes trying to start their elective careers at the top., But there are some wild-card members of Congress who could jump into the race and tilt it one way or the other., And thats just for 2016., Suddenly in the past week, the political picture for 2018 also has become a bit clearer. Who will succeed the finally termed-out Gov. Jerry Brown? It wont be Harris if she wins the Senate seat. And if she loses, shell be damaged goods., Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, 47, quickly took himself out of the Senate speculation, refreshingly asserting that \"its always better to be candid than coy.\" Hes obviously planning to run for governor, the job he covets, although you wont be hearing him say that publicly for a while., \"I dont want to get ahead of myself,\" Newsom told me. \"But Im here for the long haul. Hopefully, Im on a path.\", A path to the governors office., The former San Francisco mayor, a fifth-generation Californian, has a special interest in governing the state, where theres so much family history. The first California Newsom arrived here during the year of statehood, 1850. His grandfather developed Squaw Valley, site of the 1960 Winter Olympics, and was a pal of Gov. Pat Brown, Jerrys dad., \"My life is California,\" he says. \"Everything I care about is here.\", All this political jockeying of recent days has provided a wonderful spectator sport for us junkies., It had been expected that Boxer, 74, would announce shell retire after her term expires in 2016. It frees up a 24-year logjam that has held back ambitious politicians seeking upward mobility. If Sen. Dianne Feinstein, 81, also calls it quits in 2018, that  combined with Browns exit  will usher in a whole new generation of top political leadership in California., Newsom and Harris, a former San Francisco district attorney, had been at the center of replacement speculation. First Newsom bowed out. Then within hours, Harris leaped in., There was no deal, they insisted  wink, wink. But so what if there was? Thats smart politics and very civilized. Voters, I suspect, couldnt care less., This much is known: Harris and Newsom both had insider information about each other. They share the same highly successful campaign consulting team of Ace Smith, Sean Clegg and Dan Newman. It also manages Browns political ventures., Thats one reason Harris and Newsom never were going to run against each other. Another is that they share similar geographical, ideological and fundraising bases., In one way, Harris being willing to vacate a great job  second most powerful in state government  and Newsom choosing to hold onto his nonsensical post doesnt compute. But Harris has always seemed more suited for the broad-focused, palsy-walsy Senate. And lieutenant governor is a decent ballot title for a gubernatorial aspirant., Plus, the first and only certain Senate opening will be in 2016, a presidential election year when the voter turnout is bound to be higher than in 2018 and more favorable to a minority candidate., Harris, daughter of a Jamaican-born father and Indian-born mother, was smart in immediately announcing her candidacy rather than playing word games about \"exploring.\", It puts other Senate wannabes on notice that theyd face stiff competition. Harris will receive potent support from womens groups. In fact, on Wednesday she picked up the endorsement of some senators, including popular liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)., Also, shell need to raise at least $20 million, and time is short. Federal fundraising rules are much more stringent than Californias., Villaraigosa would enter the race as an underdog carting some old personal baggage. But theres a lot of baggage in politics. And voters tend to have more compelling priorities., Being an underdog opposed by the political establishment has never stopped Villaraigosa, a former state Assembly speaker, from running and winning. And this is his window., Steyers goal is less to become a prestigious senator than to promote his fight against global warming. Worth $1.6 billion from managing a hedge fund, he poured $74 million into various campaigns last year trying to make climate change a priority issue. But it just isnt for most voters., Rather than running a grueling race himself and likely losing, he should just buy a candidate., Then there are some U.S. House members mulling a race, including Loretta Sanchez, 55, of Garden Grove., Sanchez would draw Latino and Southern California votes from Villaraigosa. But shed also peel off womens votes from Harris. Unlike those two, however, shed be forced to surrender her current job. Thats probably too risky., Presumably, the candidates will give us better reasons to vote for them than gender or ethnicity., You could always count on Boxer to be there for the working stiff and the environment.

Some inquiries were serious, some were hostile, and some were downright funny., On the serious side, Clinton said she still favors closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay. She said she would consider supporting a constitutional amendment overturning the Supreme Courts Citizens United ruling to limit the amount of money that corporations could contribute to campaigns if there is no other way to deal with the Citizens United decision., Clinton praised President Obamas statement Monday that President Putins promise of a full and fair investigation into the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 must be supported by actions. Clinton said the U.S. should do more to ensure a thorough investigation into the attack on the plane from the Ukrainian territory controlled by Russian-backed separatists., We should work to bring our European allies together with us on tougher sanctions that would make it clear to Putin that there is a price to pay for this kind of behavior and we should encourage Europeans to start immediately to make sure they are less dependent on Russian energy so they are not intimidated, Clinton wrote to one of her Facebook questioners. She added that she would like to see more support given to the Ukrainians to guard their borders and to protect themselves., Clinton also briefly weighed in on the conflict in Gaza, noting that she negotiated the last cease-fire in November 2012 and is fully supportive of Secretary [John F.] Kerrys efforts to work with the Egyptians to forge a new cease-fire., Many Facebook participants directed questions to Clinton about whether she would run for president in 2016.

{"Content": "[[, Win or loseand theres no question hes runningRand Paul has firmly established himself as the most intriguing Republican eyeing the White House in 2016., Thursday brought fresh evidence as the Kentucky senator leaped headlong into the racial cauldron that is Ferguson, Mo., with a bluntly stated Time magazine essay on the police shooting of Michael Brown. Weighing in was hardly a surprise; there are flies circling honey pots with more restraint than a politician given a chance to hold forth on the issue of the day., Rather, what was striking was the angry tone and underlying sympathies of Pauls essay, a condemnation of the rising militarization of law enforcement in the country and assertion that equal justice under law is more a pleasing bromide than reality on the streets of 2014 America., Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention, Paul wrote. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth., Pauls rhetoric is not just a break with others in the embryonic Republican presidential field; it challenges GOP political orthodoxy going back several decades, ever since Richard Nixon made law and order a cudgel to batter Democrats in the riot-torn 1968 campaign. The strategy may have reached its apogeeor nadir20 years later, when the elder George Bush won the White House in part due to fears summoned by the lurid visage of black convict Willie Horton, used as a symbol of Michael Dukakis woolly headed liberalism., All of which makes Paul, in a phrase that grew fashionable when Bill Clinton challenged the verities of his Democratic Party, a very different kind of Republicanone seemingly eager to shatter preconceived notions of him and his party., Taking the side of protesters against alleged police brutality--however implicitly--is a startling way to position ones self in a Republican primary. But it is wholly consistent with what has been an unorthodox Paul strategy from the start., He has made it plain that his appeal is not to the barnacled Old Guard of the party but a younger, presumably hipper and more broad-minded constituency. , We need to be like the rest of America, Paul memorably counseled fellow Republicans at a New Hampshire campaign appearance last year. Were going to win when we look like America. We need to be white, we need to be brown, we need to be black, we need to be with tattoos, without tattoos, with ponytails, without ponytails, with beards, without.\", The issues that Paul has pursued, foremost among them personal protections against a vast, overweening federal government, are resonant with the libertarian devotees of his father, former Republican Rep. Ron Paul, a thrice-failed candidate for president., But he also has sought to broaden his appeal, and that of the Republican Party, among skeptical black voters by taking on issues like prison-sentencing reform, noting the disproportionate impact the so-called war on drugs has had on young African American men., What is more, Paul has ventured -- with decidedly mixed results -- before black audiences and other places where Republicans are scarcely seen. (Though some of the drama can be overstated; for all the talk of Pauls brave appearance earlier this year at UC Berkeley, the fact is there are plenty of libertarians and even conservatives to be found in the San Francisco Bay Area, and many of those who attended were already supporters of the Kentucky lawmaker.), Pauls illuminating Time essay was an exercise in political finesse, wrapping his condemnation of police tactics around an argument against government overreach., There is a systemic problem with todays law enforcement, he wrote. Not surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armieswhere police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement., That is not an easy argument to makeappealing to both the sensitivities of black voters and the unhappiness of big-government foesand Paul has hardly proven the most supple of politicians.

{"Content": "[[, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker fell for Donald Trumps evil scheme. Trump came up with an immigration plan that is so preposterous it proves he must be an undercover Democratic Party saboteur tasked with ruining any chance for a Republican victory in the 2016 presidential race., David Horsey / Los Angeles Times, David Horsey / Los Angeles Times, Once upon a time, Walker favored a path to citizenship for the 11 million or so undocumented immigrants in the United States. That was before he got serious about running for president and felt the need to tap into the anti-immigrant anger on the right. This week, he endorsed major elements of Trumps plan. Walker said he, too, now wants to build a big wall along the border with Mexico and cancel the guarantee of citizenship for children born on American soil whose parents are in the country illegally., Walker did not specify if he also agrees with Trumps assertion that every undocumented person must be deported, along with their American-born kids, but he did tell radio host Glenn Beck that one of the things you cant ignore is that [Trumps] tapped into something very real., Or surreal. Just when Trump was starting to be taken more seriously as a candidate with staying power by both GOP voters and the media, he unveiled his immigration plan. Sure, it appeals to angry folks who like how he characterized the Mexicans slipping across the border as rapists and criminals steered to the U.S. by the Mexican government. But, as policy, it has no chance of working. Deporting 11 million people is an impossible task for the federal government, which has neither the manpower nor the financial resources. Tossing American citizens into the mix, even if they are children, would also be illegal. Eliminating the right to citizenship for children born on American soil would take a constitutional amendment that would never pass, while getting Mexico to pay for the border wall is another Trump pipe dream., Right-wing conspiracy theorists who have been suspicious of Trump all along can now argue even more fervently that he is a Democratic wolf in sheeps clothing (and a red billionaires tie!) who is deviously pushing the other Republican contenders to sign on to his crazy immigration plan. Walker is all in and Ted Cruz cannot be far behind, along with Bobby Jindal, Mike Huckabee and maybe other candidates., Why is this so good for Democrats? Because no one can become president of the United States without a large share of the Latino vote. George W. Bush was helped in the tight election of 2000 by winning a third of Latino voters and did even better in 2004, getting around 40%. In 2008, John McCain pulled in 31% of Latino votes and lost to Barack Obama. In 2012, loser Mitt Romney did worse with just 27%. During that time, the Latino vote has been increasing as a segment of the electorate, which means a Republican presidential nominee needs more, not less, Latino support., Latinos care about a variety of issues and many are religious, pro-business social conservatives. Republicans have opportunities among these voters, but not if the party is seen as bellicose in its policies on undocumented immigrants from Mexico and other parts of Latin America. Trumps plan qualifies as bellicose, and any GOP candidate who signs on in favor of it is only certifying that when a new president takes the oath of office on Jan. 20, 2017, that person will be a Democrat., Conspiracy theories aside, there really is no evidence that Donald Trump concocted his immigration plan with anything other than a sincere Republican heart. Still, the Democratic National Committee should at least send him a thank-you note.]", "Date": "20150820", "Title": "[Trump's immigration scheme kills Republican chances with Latinos]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/topoftheticket/la-na-tt-trump-immigration-scheme-20150819-story.html", "Author": "[David Horsey]"}
{"Content": "[[, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is now officially in the race for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and many folks in the GOP believe that he has the right combination of electability, experience and conservative appeal to be a major contender. Then, again, he may be justan overrated, pandering weasel., David Horsey / Los Angeles Times, David Horsey / Los Angeles Times, Walker has gone through contortions to change his positions on immigration and ethanol to please conservative voters in Iowa, where he currently holds a strong position in the polls. To appeal to those same voters, he has become a sudden champion of traditional marriage, declaring his support fora constitutional amendment that would allow states to ban same-sex marriages. He has avoided a straight answer about whether he believes in evolution, but has made it veryclear he does not think climate change is anything to worry about. He has also cozied up to the billionaire Koch brothers -- they have cozied up to him too -- gainingtheir blessing and their financial backing by subscribing to their long list of pro-corporate, anti-worker policies., None of this sets him apart from most of the crowded Republican pack. Still, he boasts of three principal attributes that supposedly make him the best choice for his party: Union-bashing, economic genius and voter appeal., Walker gained national attention by taking on public employee unions and scrapping their collective bargaining rights, and then followed up with an assault on private unions. He came away as a victor, but his claim that picking on teachers, firefighters, cops and the working class of Wisconsin has prepared him to face down Islamic State terrorists is more than a little overblown., Walker brags that his implementationof big tax breaks and cuts to state and local services has created a minor economic miracle in Wisconsin. Corporate lobbyists and the business wing of the GOP love him for it, but what he has achieved is less miracle than mediocrity. Here are a few facts about Wisconsins economic situation gleaned fromfactcheck.organd PolitiFact.com:,  In October 2014, during his reelection campaign, Walker declared that his reforms had created 8,400 new private-sector jobs the previous month. According to subsequent annual figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, however, it turns out the state lost a net 4,200 jobs in September 2014.,  Walker also claimed that Wisconsin ranked in the top four among Midwestern states in private-sector job growth. Its not clear which Midwest he was talking about, but among the 12 states the U.S. Census Bureau counts as Midwest, Wisconsin actually ranked ninth with a 4.3% job-growth rate, well below the national average of 6.6% for the same period. The state is also below average in wage growth and, for much of Walkers time in office, was dead last in wage increases among the Midwestern states.,  The state ranks near the bottom in the number of new businesses.,  All this trimming of government has not guaranteed a sound state budget. Walker comes up with projections of future surpluses, but shortfalls are just as likely.,  The people who are better off are the rich and big corporations who have gotten hefty tax cuts. The biggest losers are public employees, thousands of whom have lost their jobs, and schoolkids who had their funding cut., Finally, Walker claims to be a big vote-getter in a Democrat-leaning state, but his reelection victory in 2014 was not nearly as impressive as the big wins of Republican gubernatorial candidates in Michigan, Illinois, New Mexico, Maine, Massachusetts and Maryland -- all states with bigger percentages of Democrats. Walkers three victories have come in one recall election and two non-presidential-year elections when lower voter turnout generally favors Republicans. To his credit, Walker won three times, despite his attack on unions that should have energized Democrats. On the other hand, the battle with labor got him a lot of attention from conservative super-PACs that dumped money into his campaigns at a level unusual for a state race. That didnt hurt., Walker may not be a completely empty suit, but he may have peaked when he was Milwaukee County executive. So far, the man appears to be a fairlyaverage politician, not an heir to Lincoln or even Reagan.]", "Date": "20150714", "Title": "[Scott Walker presidential?

{"Content": "[[, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who has enjoyed several months of good news in his prospective quest for the Republican presidential nomination, hit a bump Thursday with a new poll showing a sharp drop in his popularity at home., Walkers job approval has fallen to 41%, with 56% disapproving, according to the latest Marquette Law School poll, which has been Wisconsins leading survey. Thats the lowest approval figure for Walker in several years of Marquettes surveys., The one piece of good news for Walker, who has not officially declared his candidacy, is that he has a healthy early lead over other Republican hopefuls in the states presidential primary. Walker is the first choice of 40% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, the survey showed, followed by Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky at 10% and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush at 8%., Winning his home-state primary, however, has not been a major worry for Walker. A more critical part of his campaign is his claim to have won three elections -- including a bitter recall battle driven by public employee unions -- in a state that has gone to the Democrats repeatedly in presidential elections. The new poll dents that image of success in a blue state., Not only has Walkers popularity declined, but voters have soured on the states outlook. The share who say the state is on the \"wrong track\" increased to 53%, up from 44% in October., By 38% to 33%, a plurality of voters said the states budget picture had gotten worse than several years ago, with 25% saying it was about the same. In the fall, shortly before Walker won election to a second term, voters by 44% to 22% said the budget situation was getting better., A majority also think Wisconsin is lagging behind other states in creating jobs., Improving the states budget and its competitiveness on jobs have been two of Walkers main claims., \"A big part of Scott Walkers narrative is not just beating the unions but effectively managing the state. Wisconsin voters dont think thats happening anymore,\" said Paul Maslin, a Democratic pollster who has worked for campaigns opposing Walker., \"All the other governors -- [Texas Rick] Perry, [Louisianas Bobby] Jindal, [New Jerseys Chris] Christie, [Ohios John] Kasich, Bush -- are going to be lining up saying, How can he be the partys nominee when his own state is turning on him?\", Voters also turned thumbs down on legislation Walker recently signed that made Wisconsin a \"right to work\" state. By 50% to 44%, voters said they oppose the law, which prevents unions from requiring workersto pay dues or representation fees. The states unions strongly opposed the law., The survey also reinforced the status of Wisconsins conservative Sen. Ron Johnson as the most-endangered Republican up for reelection in 2016. Only 32% of voters have a favorable view of Johnson, with 29% unfavorable and 39% uncertain. His likely Democratic opponent, former Sen. Russ Feingold, gets a warmer 47%-to-26% favorability rating., In an early head-to-head test, Feingold led Johnson, 54% to 38%, the survey found., On the Democratic side, the poll showed Hillary Rodham Clinton with a huge lead over potential rivals for the presidential nomination, much as she has in other states., Clinton had support of 58% of Democrats and independents who lean Democratic, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 14% and Vice President Joe Biden at 12%. Two Democrats who have indicated they might run against Clinton, former Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, each had 1%., In a head-to-head contest, Clinton beat Walker, 52% to 40%., The poll was released the same day that two longtime aides to Walker announced the formation of a so-called super PAC to support his candidacy. Nearly all serious presidential hopefuls now have such PACs, which are allowed to collect unlimited contributions, giving big-money donors a way to completely bypass the limits that theoretically control contributions to candidates., Walker, like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, is in a particularly advantageous position because he is not a federal officeholder and, as a result, can directly solicit potential donors to a super PAC and coordinate his activities with the group until he officially declares himself a candidate. Potential candidates who are federal officials face restrictions on soliciting., The new super PAC will be called Unintimidated, the title of Walkers book about his fight to limit collective bargaining by the states public employee unions., The poll of 803 registered voters, interviewed by land line and cellphones April 7-10, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points., For more on politics and policy, follow@DavidLauter on Twitter., 6:45 p.m.: The story was updated to add information about the creation of a \"super PAC\" to support Walkers candidacy., The story was originally published at 3 p.m., ]", "Date": "20150416", "Title": "[Wisconsin Gov.

{"Content": "[[, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walkers emergence as a top presidential contender may provide the most serious challenge to the Republican Partys post-2012 self-admonition that it change its focus to bring in more women, minorities and young people., Walker, 47, became on Monday the 15th Republican to enter the 2016 presidential race, defining himself as the one candidate who is both a warrior for conservative causes and a winner who can turn them into policy., If our reforms can work in a blue state like Wisconsin, they can work anywhere in America, Walker said, sleeves rolled up, to a crowd of flag-waving supporters. My record shows that I know how to fight and win. Now, more than ever, we need a president who will fight and win for America., He pitched himself as new fresh leadership, but he has depended on an old-school coalition in his rise to the top., Walker, who used the word fight 13 times during Mondays 37-minute speech, has built his career galvanizing core conservative voters in a relatively homogeneous state, losing by huge margins among Democrats and Wisconsins small minority population, and tipping the scales with a modest majority of independent voters., Walker made his name nationally by stripping power from public employee unions, and emerging triumphantly from an attempt by unions and Democrats to recall him from office. Mondays announcement event included several reminders of the brutal battle, including a few shouting matches between sign-waving protesters andsome of Walkers supporters as they entered the Waukesha County Exposition Center outside Milwaukee., Speakers introducing Walker all invoked his resolve in the face of national protests, or what Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch characterized as a movement out of control on the left. Another speaker, Rachel Campos-Duffy, made a particularly visceral appeal to the Republican base, joking that 24 was not only the number of years Walker has been married to his wife, Tonette, but also Bill Clintons favorite age., As Walker prepared to launch his presidential campaign, he has shifted his positions and rhetoric further to the right in order to court cultural conservatives and immigration hard-liners. His speech Monday included several nods to cultural conservatives, including a promise to stand up for the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and to stand up for our religious rights and all of our other constitutional rights., He also pledged a more assertive foreign policy that would terminate the bad deal with Iran on day one, a reference to the looming agreement between world powers and Iran over its nuclear program, and stop the aggression of Russia into sovereign nations., Our goal is peace, but there will be times when America must fight, he said, invoking his domestic policy theme as a foreign policy principle., If Walker continues to be viewed as a top contender for the nomination, the question of whether his Wisconsin electoral blueprint will work at the national level -- among a far more diverse electorate during a higher-turnout election -- will loom larger., You have to take him seriously because hes succeeded in a Democratic state, said Paul Maslin, a political consultant based in Madison, Wis., who worked with Democrats on the unsuccessful attempt to recall Walker in 2012. Ive given up underestimating him., To win the nomination, Walker is banking on defeating a crowded GOP field as the only candidate who can appeal to the partys business establishment, its religious conservative faction and its tea party voters. The son of a minister who took on labor unions, he has had a lock on all three of those groups in Wisconsin., Iowa, the first caucus state with a powerful bloc of social conservatives, is crucial to Walkers primary strategy. His prime competition there includes some of the most conservative candidates in the field, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee., Walker can be seen as completely acceptable to the right within the party and yet still not threatening to business interests, said Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll., Franklins polling shows Walker has been successful in that strategy at home, gaining favorable impressions from 78% of self-described moderate voters, 91% of conservatives, 95% of very conservative voters and 96% of tea party voters, who overlap with some of the other groups., Though all of the top Republican presidential aspirants are conservative, there are differences in their tones. Former Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida as well as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky have made overt attempts through personal stories, campaign events and policy positions to court African American, Latino or younger voters., Bush, for example, recently went beyond other candidates in condemning the Confederate flag, highlighting his effort to remove it in Florida and labeling it a racist symbol. He dropped his previous support for a constitutional amendment to outlaw same-sex marriage, despite frustration among conservatives with last months Supreme Court ruling that gave gays the right to wed., Walker, on the other hand, called for a constitutional amendment to overturn the gay-marriage decision immediately. He has also sharpened his rhetoric on changing immigration laws in recent months, saying hes against amnesty, a reversal from his earlier support for granting citizenship to some people in the U.S. illegally., Waukesha County, where he held his announcement Monday, mirrors his homogenous appeal. Unlike Milwaukee, the relatively diverse county that Walker led before he became governor, neighboring Waukesha is overwhelmingly Republican and 94% white., He has highlighted his strong anti-abortion record and beliefs, even though he claimed in a 2014 ad that one such measure intended to curb abortions leaves the final decision to a woman and her doctor. Abortion-rights groups said the ad was misleading. Walker has promised to sign a measure approved by the Wisconsin Assembly last week that would ban abortions after 20 weeks., In the Republican primaries, Bushs challenge is: Will he be seen as conservative enough? He certainly has moderate temperament, said Ari Fleischer, the former spokesman to President George W. Bush who is not supporting a candidate in the GOP primary. Walkers challenge is, will he go too far in ideological conservatism? But he also has the right temperament., Walker has argued that if he wins the nomination, he can help Republicans win in other Midwestern swing states that often vote Democratic in presidential elections. But the challenge elsewhere will be far different. Nationally, minorities make up nearly 40% of the population, more than double the proportion in Wisconsin. These voters, as well as younger voters of all ethnicities who tend to be more liberal on social issues, show up in much greater numbers in general elections., The party argued in a detailed and blunt postmortem, issued four months after Mitt Romneys stinging defeat in the last presidential election, that it must move beyond its base of older conservative white men by presenting a more tolerant face and passing an immigration overhaul that would position the party to compete for Latinos, the fastest-growing segment of the electorate., Walker enters the race amid feverish positioning on immigration forced by sharp rhetoric from Donald Trump, the real-estate magnate and reality television star who has done well in some primary polls., Henry Barbour, an Republican National Committee member from Mississippi who helped write the partys 2012 postmortem, said not every candidate will have the same connections to minority communities that the party is trying to attract. He cited Bush, a longtime Miami-area resident with a Mexican-born wife, as an example of someone who has a history that other candidates lack., ------------, For the record:, 2:15 p.m., July 13:An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush as a Miami native. He is a longtime resident of the Miami area., ------------, Everybodys going to run a little different campaign, said Barbour, who is supporting former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Hes not Jeb. Hes Scott Walker., Maslin said he believes Walker that will come flying back to the middle in a heartbeat if thats what it takes to win., Barbour said most candidates are now focusing on the voters they need to win: primary voters in early states. But he said he believes that whoever the party nominates will need to find a way to reach minority communities -- not by changing their principles but by engaging with voters on conservative issues that will resonate with them., We dont have to solve everything in a day, he said. We dont have to solve it all in 2016. We just have to make significant progress since 2012., Secter reported from Waukesha and Bierman from Washington., Twitter:@noahbierman, 4:29 p.m.: This story was updated with Walkers remarks from his announcement., 4:23 a.m.: This article has been updated with Walkers announcement that he is running for president., This article was originally published at 3 a.m.]", "Date": "20150713", "Title": "[Entering presidential race, Scott Walker challenges GOP's desire to diversify]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-scott-walker-announce-20150713-story.html", "Author": "[Bob Secter, Noah Bierman ]"}
{"Content": "[[, With Antonio Villaraigosa no longer a threat to her campaign for U.S. Senate, some Democratic leaders see state Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris as Barbara Boxers inevitable successor., \"I think she is a prohibitive favorite,\" said Eric Bauman, the partys Los Angeles County chairman., But uncertainties abound as Harris trudges toward the June 2016 primary and, should she finish first or second, the runoff that November. Potential rivals have more than a year to declare their candidacies., A significant faction of the state Democratic Party is still yearning for another Latino to get in the race, now that Villaraigosa has declined to run., Several members of Congress, all of whom have more federal policy experience than Harris, are exploring whether to join the race. And as the first major candidate, Harris will face a prolonged period of scrutiny of her record by the media and political adversaries., Bill Carrick, a longtime campaign advisor to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, said it was unlikely that Harris would glide into the Senate without vigorous opposition., \"I think its very hard to get a free pass in American politics,\" he said. \"Politics abhors a vacuum.\", Both Boxer and Feinstein faced fiercely contested Democratic primaries before winning their Senate seats in 1992. The election next year will be Californias first since then with an open Senate seat., On Tuesday, Villaraigosa, a former Los Angeles mayor, became the latest in a string of big-name Democrats to decline to run for Boxers seat since the four-term senator announced last month she would not seek reelection., For Harris, a former San Francisco district attorney, early positioning as a presumed front-runner is not entirely an asset, even if it allows her to get a jump on the tedious but crucial task of fundraising., \"She has as much of a lock on this as Hillary Clinton had on the Democratic nomination for president in 2007 and 2008,\" said Antonio Gonzalez, president of the William C. Velasquez Institute, a Latino think tank., Gonzalez said efforts by Harris supporters to clear the field for her \"wont be successful.\", In Napa Valley on Wednesday, Villaraigosa spoke at a private lunch of the California Legislative Latino Caucus, which commissioned a poll last month to gauge voter interest in a Latino candidate for Senate., Asked whether he hoped another Latino would enter the race, Villaraigosa said, \"Theres a lot of talent in this state., \"Its always good to have a debate of ideas,\" he added., Some Latino lawmakers were openly unenthused by the prospect of Harris facing minimal opposition., \"Im hoping that more people enter the fray,\" said state Sen. Ben Hueso (D-San Diego)., Harris was raising campaign money Wednesday in Washington, where she was also attending a meeting of the National Assn. of Attorneys General., Several of her would-be rivals have substantial sums of federal election money already in the bank, including Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank), who started the year with more than $2.1 million., Schiff said Wednesday that Villaraigosas exit \"means that there is a profound opportunity for a strong Southern California candidate.\", \"I think theres a real hunger to have a representative from the south, and so thats wide open,\" he said in an interview at the Capitol. \"Im certainly giving it a lot of thought.\", House members face the tough choice of whether to abandon relatively safe seats for what would be an uphill statewide race. Schiff was just installed as the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee., Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles), who in two decades has climbed to the upper ranks of the partys House leadership, said Wednesday that he still had \"a lot of work and a lot of listening to do\" before he decided whether to run for Senate., Another uncertainty for Harris is the potential emergence of a rich candidate who could fund a campaign. Also unknown is whether any individuals or interest groups will take advantage of the unlimited independent spending allowed in a Senate race., \"Its the outside spending, I think, thats going to make a critical difference this time around,\" said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a USC public policy professor and veteran analyst of California politics., How deftly Harris will respond to politically sensitive issues also remains unclear., In an interview last week, for example, she declined to say whether, if she were a senator, she would attend Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus upcoming address to a joint session of Congress. Netanyahu was invited by House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) without consulting the White House, drawing a rebuke from President Obama and leading some Democrats to vow to boycott the speech., A senior Harris advisor, Brian Brokaw, said Harris position now was that she would not boycott the speech., Brokaw did not respond to repeated inquiries about whether Harris agreed with Obamas national security advisor, Susan Rice, that Netanyahus decision to give the speech was \"destructive of the fabric of the relationship\" between Israel and the United States., michael.finnegan@latimes.comTwitter: @finneganLAT, patrick.mcgreevy@latimes.comTwitter: @mcgreevy99, Times staff writer Michael A.

{"Content": "[[, With Californians facing a possible vote next year on whether to legalize the recreational use of marijuana, supporters are scrambling to craft a measure that can win broad public support., So far, three groups have submitted proposed marijuana ballot measures to state election authorities. It will take months to sort out whether any of them  or others not yet proposed  gain final approval for next years ballot., To varying degrees, Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska have already legalized recreational pot. But the scale of legalization in California would be far bigger, and it would affect a vast existing patchwork of marijuana crops and medical dispensaries., A forum Tuesday at UCLA laid out a panoply of challenges the sponsors face in addressing concerns about stoned drivers, pesticides in marijuana crops, the persistence of a black market for the drug and much more., There are a lot of questions that do need to be asked, said Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who was presiding over the first public airing of the issues by a marijuana policy commission that he formed with the American Civil Liberties Union of California., Its not yet clear, Newsom said, whether competing groups of marijuana advocates can unite behind one November 2016 ballot measure that would address public safety concerns adequately enough to survive campaign attacks., At UCLA, one of the main concerns raised by law enforcement authorities was the lack of adequate technology to test drivers for marijuana impairment. With alcohol, they said, a precise gauge of blood-alcohol level corresponds directly to the risk of causing a traffic accident., But there is no accepted standard for measuring how much marijuana impairs driving skills., The science is not there yet with marijuana, said Ventura Police Chief Ken Corney, first vice president of the California Police Chiefs Assn., which opposes pot legalization., Medical marijuana advocate Kristin Nevedal of Americans for Safe Access said states need to take into account that impairment lasts longer after ingesting marijuana in food than it does after smoking it  and either way, traces remain in the body for days or weeks., Paul Gallegos, a former Humboldt County district attorney, raised concerns about environmental damage caused by marijuana growers diverting water from streams, as well as their unregulated use of pesticides and fertilizers that poison wildlife., Although the states multibillion-dollar marijuana industry does immense environmental harm, he said, state oversight could diminish the damage., We need to see this problem as an opportunity to develop a regulatory scheme, Gallegos said., Newsom himself raised concerns about marijuana taxes being set so high that they perpetuate the black market., Harlan Grossman, a former Superior Court judge in Contra Costa County, suggested a solution: tougher penalties for pot growers and dealers who circumvent the states new licensing system., Grossman also suggested state lawmakers, or authors of any marijuana ballot measure, address other questions: Would existing marijuana possession and sale cases be dismissed? Would arrest warrants be recalled? Would penalties from prior convictions still be due? Would old offenses be expunged?, In 2010, Californians rejected a ballot proposal to legalize marijuana, but public opinion has shifted since then. A recent Public Policy Institute of California poll found that 53% of state residents believe pot should be legal., One measure of the momentum for a new statewide vote on marijuana was a $1-million contribution made last week by Weedmaps Media to its election campaign committee, Californians for Sensible Reform. Weedmaps is a website with a guide to marijuana availability around the world., For Newsom, a candidate for governor in 2018, the run-up to another statewide marijuana vote has offered a platform for publicity that can be hard to come by for a lieutenant governor. His commission is planning three more hearings around the state., At UCLA, he said he hoped California doesnt wind up with marijuana stores on every street corner, pot smoke wafting across park playgrounds, and weed-laced gummy bears and jelly beans tempting children., To that end, he said, the panel will try to ensure that a stable legal structure is set up for recreational pot use., Im interested in evidence, Newsom said.

{"Content": "[[, With Mondays release of landmark rules to combat global warming, President Obama is putting into place what probably will be the last piece of his ambitioussecond-term agenda one that highlights deep divisions in the country and helps shape the race to succeed him., On immigration, healthcare, same-sex marriage and now climate change, Obama has aggressively used the powers of his office to align public policy with the values and aspirations of a largely urban, liberal and minority constituency heavily concentrated on the East and West coasts., In the process, he has courted a backlash from Republican constituencies and states  an older, whiter population concentrated in the South and the nations interior., That division was plain to see in reactions to the new rules, which aim to change how the nation generates electricity in order to cut emission of carbon dioxide and other gases blamed for warming the worlds climate., Over the next 15 years, the plan would aim to sharply reduce the use of coal and ramp up the use of wind and solar power. Currently, coal accounts for almost 40% of the nations electricity, while wind and solar produce about 5%. By 2030, if the administrations plan works, renewables would account for 28% of U.S. power generation, edging past coal at 27%., The plan would boost efforts already underway, mostly in coastal states, led by California, to greatly increase the use of renewable power. But for those parts of the country still heavily reliant on coal, nearly all of them Republican-governed states in the Midwest, Great Plains and South, the rules would force a major economic transition that many elected officials have vowed to resist., Interested in the stories shaping California? Sign up for the free Essential California newsletter >>, Democratic presidential hopefuls quickly lined up to praise the plan. Republicans, who have accused the administration of waging a war on coal, attacked it., Obama is scheduled to formally unveil the regulations on Monday, but administration officials released an outline on Sunday., Our countrys clean-energy transition is happening faster than anybody anticipated, Environmental Protection Agency chief Gina McCarthy told reporters in a conference call. The new rules will accelerate those trends and maintain the reliability and affordability of the nations electrical supply while slowing climate change, she said., The EPA will issue the rules using its authority under the Clean Air Act, meaning that Obama does not need to seek congressional approval. But opponents of the plan have already said they would try to block it in court., Anticipating lawsuits, the administration dropped some elements of a preliminary proposal it issued in June 2014 and gave states an additional two years, until 2022, to comply with the new rules. But administration officials say the new plan will deliver a somewhat bigger cut in carbon emissions than they had projected last year. Thats largely because emissions from power plants are already dropping, McCarthy said., Taking into account the improvements already underway made the lift we had to achieve a lot lower, she said., Overall, the EPA estimates the plan will reduce emissions from the nations electrical industry by 32% compared with the level in 2005, which is the baseline the administration uses. Because electricity generation accounts for about one-third of U.S. carbon emissions, reductions from power plants would be a major step toward the administrations goal of cutting total U.S. emissions by 26% to 28% over the next 15 years., The EPA estimates that the rule will add $8.4 billion to utility costs over that period, but will yield at least four times that amount in benefits, said White House senior advisor Brian Deese. The utility industry already spends about $100 billion a year on plants and equipment, McCarthy noted., NEWSLETTER:Get the days top headlines from Times Editor Davan Maharaj >>, Administration officials see the new rules as a significant enticement to get other countries to commit to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions in global talks. Negotiations are scheduled to convene in Paris in December with hopes of achieving a new international agreement on combating climate change., But some environmental advocates say the administrations plans are already too weak to stop the warming of the worlds climate. They are likely to carefully scrutinize the new plan for signs that the administration made too many concessions to industry. Major environmental organizations withheldmost comment on the new plan Sunday, saying they needed time to study the details., Political figures were less reticent., Hillary Rodham Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination to succeed Obama, issued a statement calling the plan a significant step forward and saying that as president, Id defend it. Other Democrats seeking the nomination followed Clintons lead., The main contenders for the Republican nomination, by contrast, were all already on record opposing the administrations plan, which has been under development for several years. Most have also expressed doubts about whether climate change is a significant problem that requires a government response., By a coincidence of the calendar, as the administration began publicly outlining its plans, many of the leading candidates for the Republican nomination were at a gathering of wealthy donors assembled by Charles and David Koch, the billionaire brothers who have heavily funded efforts to oppose government regulation of the economy, particularly the energy industry., Speaking to that gathering, at a resort hotel in Dana Point, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), one of the presidential aspirants, said the new plan will make the cost of electricity higher for millions of Americans and will achieve nothing because any U.S. reductions will quickly be overwhelmed by increased emissions from other countries., As far as I can see, China and India and other developing countries are going to continue to burn anything they can get their hands on, Rubio said. We must balance our interests for the ecology, which is legitimate, with our interest for the economy, he added., Jeb Bush, in a statement, called the administrations plan irresponsible and overreaching and said it would throw countless people out of work and increase energy prices., The stark political divide means the administrations plan for reshaping the power industry will join an already lengthy list of major policies up for grabs in the 2016 election. In addition to Obamas big domestic initiatives, the list includes the proposed agreement to limit Irans nuclear programs and the warming of U.S. relations with Cuba., The administrations plan would give each state a target for reducing emissions and ask them to come up with detailed blueprints for achieving those goals. Those blueprints could include a wide range of techniques, including increased use of renewable fuels, expanded use of nuclear power, closing older coal-fired plants and improvements in energy efficiency. The plan will include incentives for states to expand renewable energy use early in the process and to invest in cleaning up dirty plants in low-income areas that have often suffered the worst effects of pollution., A new president who opposed the plan could try to repeal it entirely or give states waivers from compliance. In the meantime, both sides will head quickly to court., Opponents are urging states to go slow until that litigation is over  a strategy that could significantly delay the plans effects. Earlier this year, for example, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a major defender of the coal industry, sent a letter to governors urging them to refuse to comply., The administrations plan goes far beyond the EPAs legal authority, he said, predicting that the courts are likely to strike it down., ALSO:, Northern California fire explodes; 24 homes lost, thousands threatened, Second American is accused of illegally killing lion in Zimbabwe, Seeking safety in Mexico City, journalist found death]", "Date": "20150802", "Title": "[How Obama's new emissions rules will likely shape the White House race]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-obama-climate-20150802-story.html", "Author": "[David Lauter]"}
{"Content": "[[, With nearly $47 million raised for the primaries, Hillary Rodham Clinton appeared likely to outpace her presidential rivals in the early race to fund their 2016 campaigns, though the Democratic front-runner has burned through a large portion of her contributions at this nascent stage., While Clinton raised a massive sum, her campaign also spent nearly $18 million, ending the fundraising quarter with about $28 million in cash on hand., Aides to Clinton said Wednesday much of that money was spent on purchasing voter lists in early primary states and other technology infrastructure., The crowded field of presidential hopefuls hasuntil a midnight deadline to file initial finance reports to the Federal Election Commission. Each campaign must raise money the old-fashioned way, painstakingly amassing checks from thousands of individual donors who can give no more than $2,700 each to support a candidate in a primary race., But those dollars stretch farther than money raised by independent committees like \"super PACs,\" since federal law requires that campaigns get the lowest available advertising rates. And the money is directly controlled by the campaigns, making it easier for candidates to focus their message and marshal get-out-the-vote efforts., Experts say the crowded field of candidates, and the relaxation of campaign finance rules since 2010, will probably drive the 2016 race to set new spending records., On the Republican side, Jeb Bush reported raising $11.4 million in the quarter ending June 30. The former Florida governor entered the race June 15 and on average raised about $714,000 per day until the end of the quarter, with a majority of donors giving the maximum contribution. He has about $8 million cash on hand., Still, Bush remains far and away the overall money leader in the early going, thanks to $103 million raised by the super PAC supporting his candidacy., Such political action committees, which can accept unlimited donations, dont have to report their donors until the end of the month., Bush reported fewer than 5,000 donors and an emphasis on bigger checks  more than $10 million of his haul came from people who gave the maximum amount. He said $228,000 was raised by lobbyist bundlers, a disclosure required by campaign law., Bush delayed formally opening his campaign until mid-June, a strategy that helped him pull in donations for his super PAC without violating FEC rules. But the strategy came with a price: Until he officially declared his candidacy, Bush personally paid for staff and consultants, the report shows, about $380,000 in all., The Bush campaign said it would report all bundlers raising money, not just lobbyists, by the next reporting deadline, Oct. 15. Bush is the first Republican candidate to pledge such a disclosure; Clinton has said she will also identify her bundlers., A Bush campaign spokeswoman said the disclosure was consistent with the candidatesrecord of transparency and, frankly, should be expected of public servants.\", Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is challenging Clinton for the Democratic nomination, reported raising $15.2 million in two months., The largest share, $10.5 million, came from people who gave less than $200 each. The campaign said he had more than 284,000 donors, who gave an average of $35., Our campaign is a strong grass-roots movement supported by middle-class Americans from working families, not billionaires trying to buy elections, Sanders said., Clinton also reported Wednesday that 250,000 donors from all 50 states contributed to her campaign., Republican Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, reported raising about $10.5 million from a broad base of donors. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) reported raising about $7 million, also relying heavily on small donors., And Donald Trump, who released a statement Wednesday asserting that he was worth $10 billion, filed a report that showed his campaign had received $1.9 million since he formally entered the race on June 16  nearly all of it in loans from Trump., But for most players in the Republican field, their campaign take was drowned by the size of the large checks landing in their super PACs., Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who joined the race in March, has reported raising $14.2 million in two quarters, a slower rate than some of his rivals., But the super PACs backing him pulled in far more, about $38 million, giving him more than $52 million overall and placing him second in the Republican field., Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, with a campaign fund of $12 million, also has showed strong early backing from outside groups, with a combined $31.9 million., Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry pulled in just over $1 million for his campaign. But thanks to checks from three large donors to outside groups, Perry already can count on nearly $18 million for his second try at the White House., New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie announced his bid after the fundraising quarter had closed, but a super PAC backing him said this week it had raised $11 million., Allies of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who officially joined the race this week, told the Washington Post they hoped to raise about $20 million by the end of the month for committees backing him., Former business executive Carly Fiorinas campaign has said it has raised $1.4 million, with another $3.4 million from outside groups., Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee reportedly raised a total of about $8 million, including $2 million for his campaign committee. Former Sen.

{"Content": "[[, With President Obamas healthcare law once again facing possible unraveling at the hands of the Supreme Court, the administration and its allies have developed a novel argument tailor-made to appeal to conservative justices: states rights., The high court is set to hear arguments March 4 to determine the legality of Affordable Care Act subsidies for approximately 7 million Americans who receive coverage from federally run health insurance marketplaces, also known as exchanges., Lawyers for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a small libertarian group in Washington, are challenging the subsidies, pointing to a passage in the law that says such tax credits may go to those who buy insurance on an \"Exchange established by the state.\", Only 13 states fully operate their own online healthcare marketplaces., The other 37 rely on the HealthCare.gov site run by the federal government. If the justices rule for the challengers, consumers in most or all of those states would lose their subsidies, making health coverage unaffordable for most of them., The Obama administration and healthcare advocates are arguing that the law, when read as a whole, makes clear that the subsidies were intended to be available nationwide for low- and moderate-income people, not just those in certain states., But if the justices doubt that reading, supporters of the law have a legal backup plan that highlights the \"clear notice\" rule for states. It says that when Congress passes a new law and seeks cooperation from the states, it must not withhold important information., The principle was spelled out in a 1981 opinion by then-Justice William H. Rehnquist, the same year John G. Roberts Jr. served as one of his law clerks., Liberals hope it will persuade Roberts, now chief justice, and some of his colleagues to uphold the tax subsidies in the 37 states that rely on the federal exchange., This focus on the federal-state balance of power appears targeted at Roberts, whose vote was crucial in upholding the laws constitutionality in 2012, and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, a longtime champion of the states who has cited the \"clear notice\" principle in the past., Supporters of the law say that even if Congress meant to restrict subsidies to marketplaces created by the state, no one warned state officials that relying on the federal version would deprive their residents of millions of dollars in insurance subsidies., Late last month, lawyers for 22 states, including Virginia, Illinois, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, told the justices they were blindsided by the claim that federal subsidies might be cut off because they failed to establish state marketplaces., \"Surprising states with a dramatic hidden consequence\" violates a basic principle of fair dealing between Washington and the states, the state lawyers said in the court brief. Congress \"does not hide elephants in mouse holes,\" they added, quoting a comment by Justice Antonin Scalia in a previous case., Oklahoma and five other states sided with opponents of the law. Their lawyers said the \"plain text\" bars subsidies for their residents, since they did not establish state marketplaces., California, New York, Connecticut and Maryland, which are among the 13 states that fully operate their own marketplaces, have endorsed the broad view that tax subsidies should be available nationwide., Of the 37 states using the federal healthcare site, a few have either technically established their own marketplaces or have partnership agreements with the federal government. The justices could choose to treat those states differently than the rest, allowing their residents to keep subsidies., But supporters of the healthcare law say they are more hopeful now of prevailing entirely in the high court, in part because of the \"clear notice\" argument. Washington lawyer Walter Dellinger, a solicitor general under President Clinton, said this federalism or states rights argument is likely to get the attention of several justices., \"If you are Congress, you dont impose a penalty on the states and then hide it in an obscure provision involving the tax code that no one noticed at the time,\" he said. This strongly suggests, he said, that Congress did not intend to punish states that decided to rely on a federal marketplace., Other provisions of the law carry the same message, supporters say. A section titled \"State flexibility\" says that states shall establish an exchange so residents can compare prices for insurance and buy policies, and that if states elect not to do so, \"the secretary [of Health and Human Services] shall establish and operate such exchange\" within the state., Citing this passage, officials from the 22 states said they understood this to mean they could run an exchange on their own, or use the federal version, but the choice would have no effect on their residents., Attorneys for the Obama administration argue that the term \"such exchange\" means that the federally run exchange would simply function in place of one created by the state, with no differences in operation., Defenders of the law recognize they face a struggle in winning over the courts conservatives, who have been skeptical of Obamas signature healthcare program., Four justices  Scalia, Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr.  voted to strike down the entire law in 2012. If Roberts joins them this time, they could deal it a severe blow., In 2012, a majority led by Roberts rendered a split decision. They upheld the mandate to buy insurance, but they also said states may refuse to expand free health insurance under the Medicaid program., In a second decision last year, they ruled by a 5-4 vote that corporate employers citing their religious faith may refuse to pay to cover certain contraceptives for their female employees., The latest case began with what some called a \"glitch\" or \"wording flaw\" in the long and complicated bill. Jonathan Adler, a libertarian law professor at Case Western Reserve University who helped launch the suit, argued the law should be interpreted based on its exact words, not the grand aims of its Democratic sponsors., \"The proper question is: What did Congress say? And the words established by the state are pretty clear,\" he said. \"People didnt focus on this in 2010 or 2011 because no one took seriously that so many states would say no.\", Ilya Shapiro, a lawyer at the libertarian CATO Institute, says the blame lies with the Democrats who wrote the law., \"This is a consequence of the frenzy to get something passed on a razor-thin partisan vote,\" he said. \"No one knew what was in it. Maybe the states lawyers missed it, or they were misled by the feds.\", Administration officials were surprised when about three dozen states  both red and blue  chose not to establish marketplaces of their own. They were also alarmed when the Supreme Court voted Nov. 7 to take up the current case, King vs. Burwell, just three days after Republicans won full control of Congress., Challengers won a round last summer when a U.S. appeals court panel in Washington, in a 2-1 vote, interpreted the law as limiting subsidies to the 13 states that fully run their own marketplaces. On the same day, an appellate court in Virginia reached the opposition conclusion, ruling that nationwide subsidies were allowed., In recent weeks, a new round of legal briefs from the administration, state officials, former members of Congress and leading law professors have argued that there was no glitch and that the law, read as a whole, provides insurance subsidies to eligible Americans regardless of where they live., \"They put the text of the statute front and center, and it shows the absurdity of the plaintiffs argument,\" said Elizabeth Wydra, attorney for the Constitutional Accountability Center, a liberal group that supports the law. \"When [the justices] read the briefs, I think it would be hard for them to rule against the government, even though they may not like the law.\", For instance, the laws supporters say, one provision permits subsidies for any applicable taxpayer whose income is less than 400% of the poverty rate, without making reference to whether the marketplace was established by the state or federal government., Another provision defines a \"qualified individual\" as someone who \"resides in the state that established the exchange.\", The provisions show that the federally run exchange was intended to serve as the de facto state exchange, U.S. Solicitor Gen. Donald Verrilli Jr. said in a court brief. Otherwise, if the second provision were read in isolation, it would imply that a federal exchange \"would literally have no customers\" since no potential applicants would live in a \"state that established the exchange.\", Why, he asked, would states have been told by Congress that they had the flexibility to rely on the federal exchange, only to learn later none of their residents could actually use it?, david.savage@latimes.com, Twitter:@DavidGSavage]", "Date": "20150226", "Title": "[Obamacare defense is tailored for key Supreme Court justices]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/business/healthcare/la-na-court-health-argument-20150226-story.html", "Author": "[David G.

{"Content": "[[, With Republican majorities now assured in both houses of Congress, Pentagon spending is likely to grow to cope with national security threats around the globe., The White House announced Friday that it would request $5.6 billion in additional funds from Congress for airstrikes and other operations against Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria. The total includes $1.6 billion to develop and train Iraqi security forces, which were routed by the Sunni militants last summer., But that figure may be dwarfed if Republican hawks follow through on promises to roll back mandatory defense spending cuts imposed by a government-wide budget cut known as sequestration., Pentagon officials certainly hope so., \"We need Congress support to get done so many of the things that were trying to get done, not the least of which is taking sequestration off our backs,\" said Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman., The Republican sweep in Tuesdays election puts Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a strong critic of defense cuts, on track to take over the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee., McCain already has called for stepping up the campaign against Islamic State, doing more to defeat Syrian President Bashar Assad and providing arms to Ukraine to fend off Russian forces, among other actions., That could mean federal funding will flow more freely to defense contractors in aerospace-rich places like Southern California, which suffered waves of layoffs over fears related to Pentagon spending cuts., \"National security was a big issue during the elections; it was out front,\" said Cord Sterling, vice president for legislative affairs at the Aerospace Industries Assn., a trade and lobbying organization in Arlington, Va. \"Theres likely to be an attempt to redraft budgets.\", With U.S. combat troops out of Iraq and being withdrawn from Afghanistan, the Pentagon was under pressure to lower war-related spending in the last round of budget requests for fiscal 2015., The overseas contingency operations request, which still must be voted on by Congress, now is likely to be increased, analysts say. At the time, the Pentagon requested $58.6 billion  about $20 billion less than the 2014 request., But that was before Islamic State fighters seized major cities in Iraq and publicly beheaded Western journalists, sparking a sharp uptick in public concern., Now American bombers, fighter jets and drones flying missions over Iraq and Syria will need maintenance and spare parts. Hundreds of smart bombs dropped on militant strongholds will need to be replaced. Intelligence gathering technology will be required for what the White House has warned will be a drawn-out fight., Already aerospace giants Raytheon Co. and Boeing Co. have won lucrative contracts for high-tech weapons that were used in the battle against Islamic State., \"There is a chance for big change coming out of these elections,\" said Ryan Crotty, budget analyst with the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"Lawmakers seem to be speaking with a more united voice, which is good news for defense.\", Defense contractors also are playing a role in the U.S. effort to combat the Ebola outbreak in West Africa., Some 1,030 U.S. troops are building isolation wards, training healthcare workers, processing laboratory samples and providing other assistance in Liberia, the hardest-hit country, and in neighboring Senegal, where the military has set up a staging area to move supplies., Earlier this week, defense firm Northrop Grumman Corp. announced a contract worth up to $27 million with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to maintain a database for pathogenic viruses such as Ebola., william.hennigan@latimes.com]", "Date": "20141108", "Title": "[Republican control of Congress could mean more military spending ]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-defense-spending-20141108-story.html", "Author": "[W.J.

{"Content": "[[, With the 2016 election cycle gearing up, special interests are eyeing ways to advance the candidates of their choice without leaving any fingerprints. Their preferred vehicle is \"dark money\" donated to organizations  including so-called social welfare groups  that are allowed under the law to conceal the names of their contributors., When the Supreme Court ruled in the Citizens United decision that corporations have a 1st Amendment right to spend money to support or oppose candidates, it balanced that finding with an insistence on the importance of disclosure. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote that transparency about the sources of political spending \"enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages.\", That noble principle is mocked by the practice of paying for election-related activities through tax-exempt organizations known as 501(c)(4) groups, named for the provision in the tax code under which they are authorized. These groups, unlike political action committees and candidates campaigns, are not required to disclose their donors., According to federal law, 501(c)(4) groups are organized \"exclusively\" for the promotion of social welfare. Examples listed in an Internal Revenue Service document include associations that build housing for the poor or provide financial planning. Theres no particular reason why people shouldnt be allowed to make charitable contributions to such social welfare organizations anonymously, and the law reasonably allows them to do so. The problem, however, is that in its regulations, the agency has redefined \"exclusively\" to mean \"primarily\"  meaning that a 501(c)(4) group may engage in significant political activity so long as politics isnt its primary occupation., How significant? Recently, campaign-reform groups criticized IRS Commissioner John Koskinen for suggesting that, under federal law, \"If you spend at this point less than 49% of your money on politics, you can be a (c)(4).\" Thus a giant loophole has been created under which campaign donors can influence political campaigns without their names being disclosed., So what can be done? More than 50 reform groups have proposed that President Obama issue an executive order requiring companies that receive federal contracts to disclose their political spending. Such an order is far from a complete answer to dark money. But it would shed light on political activity by firms with a vested interest in courting favor with candidates for federal office., And while hes at it, Obama should urge the IRS to scrap the 49% rule and enforce the laws requirement that 501(c)(4)s engage in social welfare activities \"exclusively.\" If companies and individuals wanted to engage in politics, they could still reach into their wallets  but they couldnt disguise their identities or their interests., Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion and Facebook]", "Date": "20150412", "Title": "[Loopholes in political spending laws keep voters in the dark]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-dark-money-20150412-story.html", "Author": "[The Times Editorial Board]"}

But in administering the law, the agency has redefined \"exclusively\" to mean \"primarily,\" allowing these groups to spend huge sums on election-related activity so long as a bare majority of their spending goes for other purposes., Unfortunately, more restrictive regulations have been a casualty of the continuing controversy over the IRS treatment of tea party and other conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. A Treasury Department inspector-general concluded that the agency subjected those groups to scrutiny based on \"inappropriate criteria.\" Although a House investigation failed to prove that the White House ordered the targeting of conservative groups, Republicans claimed that President Obamas rhetoric \"influenced how the IRS engaged with these groups.\", Despite the backlash, the IRS  appropriately  moved to develop new regulations for social welfare groups. But preliminary rules proposed a definition of \"election-related activities\" so broad that it included nonpartisan voters guides and candidate debates sponsored by nonpartisan groups. Now regulations are on hold, and Republicans in Congress have proposed legislation to impose a one-year moratorium on rule-making., That would be good news for donors who want to influence elections anonymously, but it would be a disaster for democracy. Rather than despair that nothing can be done until after the election, the IRS should move promptly to adopt new regulations that would restore Congress original intent and make it clear that election advocacy isnt a \"social welfare\" activity that can be funded by nameless donors. If Congress attempts to legislate a moratorium on new rules, Obama should reach for his veto pen., Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion and Facebook]", "Date": "20150805", "Title": "[A legal -- for now -- end-run around Citizens United]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-irs-regulations-social-welfare-organizations-501c4-20150805-story.html", "Author": "[The Times Editorial Board]"}
{"Content": "[[, With the additions of Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson on Monday to the growing list of Republican presidential hopefuls, the GOP diversified its slate of candidates as it tries to promote an image of inclusion to appeal to a broader group of voters., Fiorina, a former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, became the lone woman to enter the GOP primaries, announcing her candidacy in a video on her website. Carson, a pioneering African American neurosurgeon, returned to his native Detroit for an hourlong ceremony  which at times felt like a church service  touting his lack of political experience as a benefit to his candidacy., But neither Fiorina nor Carson, who have only outside chances of winning the nomination, possess the sort of widespread support among party officials and large fundraising bases enjoyed by top-tier hopefuls. They do, however, give Republicans a nod toward inclusiveness as the party tries to broaden its base from a core that is older, whiter and more male than the American population to one that is more reflective of the country., An issue Republicans face headed into 2016  which has dogged the party in past elections  is a perception that the party is not in tune with challenges faced by those who are not white and affluent., But the long-shot nature of Fiorinas and Carsons candidacies shows the party has further to go toward changing that view. Carson has done well in some early polls, but those numbers more likely reflect the admiration he receives among many conservatives than any serious chance of winning the nomination. And Fiorina has been dogged by criticism over the 30,000 layoffs she made while at Hewlett-Packard, an attack that may follow her into the primary., Anyone can throw their hat into the ring; it doesnt mean theyre going to get votes, said Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, the first African American to hold that position. But to see the range of candidates currently in the Republican field makes it clear that our party is not monolithically white and male., Indeed, among the Republicans who poll better than Carson or Fiorina are Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, both of Cuban descent. And Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who is exploring a presidential run, is Indian American., For her part, Fiorina focused not on other Republicans but on Hillary Rodham Clinton, the clear Democratic front-runner., She is of the professional political class. She creates a disconnect, Fiorina said in a call with reporters Monday. People of all political persuasions believe there is a huge gulf between their lives and those in Washington., Like much of the Republican field, Fiorina has also assailed Clinton on foreign policy, criticizing her actions related to the 2012 attack on an American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, and U.S. relations with Russia., Beth Miller, who was a senior advisor to Fiorinas failed 2010 campaign against Sen. Barbara Boxer of California, said that as a woman, Fiorina has a unique ability to take on Clinton without being perceived as condescending or overly aggressive., Carly is a great candidate and will be able to offer distinctions between herself and other candidates, but especially Hillary, Miller said., Fiorina also spoke of her own vision for job growth and creating and sustaining small business, new business and family-owned business., While Fiorina has run for public office, Carson largely remained out of politics until 2013., At a national prayer breakfast that year, Carson, who is retired from his position as director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital, gained plaudits from conservatives for castigating Obamas healthcare law while the president sat nearby., Some of his comments since then, however, such as calling Obamacare the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery, have drawn criticism from more moderate Republicans and Democrats., Im not politically correct, and Im probably never going to be politically correct, because Im not a politician, Carson said in Detroit on Monday, after a gospel choir sang several songs, including Eminems Lose Yourself, in the lead up to his speech. I want to do whats right., Carson described himself as supporting family values and having a deep belief in God, while he defended himself against critics who say he would cut into social welfare programs for the poorest Americans., Steele, who has known Carson from Maryland GOP political circles, said some voters would probably be drawn to the doctors personal story. Carson was raised by a single mother with a third-grade education who worked odd jobs to help provide for her children., In the world of national politics, he is certainly untested, Steele said.

{"Content": "[[, With the economically struggling city of Detroit as his literal and symbolic backdrop, Jeb Bush on Wednesday argued that a progressive and liberal mind-set was standing in the way of recovery for the nation and particularly for Americans low on the income ladder., Bush, in a speech to the Detroit Economic Club, sketched the bare outlines of what will be his pitch if, as expected, he runs for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. His remarks were shy on specifics, however, apart from an animated recitation of how he worked to change Floridas education system during his two terms as governor., Look around this city, he told an audience of civic leaders. In its history, there is a warning to all of us., He blamed decisions by Detroits Democratic leaders for the cratered state of a city that once was among the wealthiest in the nation., I know some in the media think conservatives dont care about the cities, but theyre wrong, he said. We believe that every American in every community has the right to pursue happiness, they have the right to rise. So I say lets go where ideas will matter the most, where the failures of liberal government policies are most obvious. Lets deliver real conservative success, and you know what will happen? Well create a whole lot of new conservatives., Bushs unofficial campaign has focused on his effort to rebrand the Republican Party, and the choice of Detroit seemed a willful effort to distance himself from the 2012 campaign by Michigan native Mitt Romney, who was savaged for his opposition to the bailout of the states automakers early in the recession., Bush did not address his own opposition to the bailout -- though he was greeted by a fusillade of criticisms by Democrats seeking to remind Detroit residents of it. But his first words served as something of a repudiation of Romneys controversial criticisms of downscale Americans who were dependent on government and who believe that they are victims. Bush flatly contradicted those words., Tens of millions of Americans no longer see a clear path to rise above their challenges. Something is holding them back -- not a lack of ambition, not a lack of hope, not because they are lazy and see themselves as victims. Something else, something is an artificial weight on their shoulders, he said., People know this country can be more than it is today, he declared. But they also know this as well: We have a lot of work to do., But like Romney, he also blamed Democrats for creating an environment of dependence on government., Instead of a safety net to cushion our occasional falls, they have built a spider web that traps people in perpetual dependence. The progressive and liberal mind-set believes that for every problem there is a Washington, D.C., solution, he said. But that instinct doesnt solve any problems., In a nearly 25-minute speech and in remarks afterward, Bush declined to specify what fiscal path he would take, other than saying he would judge matters solely on whether an action would contribute to growth. Nor did he, when asked in a question-and-answer session, provide details of his positions on other key issues., Asked what the country needed to do to solve its immigration problems, for example, he asserted that immigration represented a huge opportunity  not a problem and was central to sustaining Americas economy over time., He called for firm federal control of the border and said that President Obama should not go beyond his constitutional powers. But he spent most of his answer dealing with legal immigration, not the politically volatile subject of how to handle the millions of residents in the country illegally., Bush did not mention his own past support for a comprehensive immigration solution and for legal status for those lacking proper papers, except for a glancing reference at those brought to this country illegally as children, many of whom are now under the protection of an Obama policy that Republicans have criticized as unconstitutional., Investors, Dreamers, people that come to our great universities, all these people should be welcomed in our country, he said, and the unwritten contract ought to be: Embrace our values and you can pursue your dreams in this great country., The former governor would be the third person in his family to seek the presidency, after his father and brother, and he spoke at some length about his affection for them and his simultaneous need to run as his own man., In 1994, he noted, he ran for governor emphasizing education and lost. Four years later, he ran again, after visiting 250 Florida schools, and won., At the end of that journey, people knew that I wasnt just the brother of George W. and the son of a loving dad; I was my own person, he said. I earned it by working hard to connect with people on a level that truly mattered. That experience on a national scale has got to be part of a national strategy., He also touched on what will likely be a Democratic effort to cast him as a foreign policy hawk in the vein of his brother, who slumped in popularity after the United States extended involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan during his administration. He criticized Obama by asserting that the Islamic State terrorists had filled a void left in the Middle East by American withdrawal., We have to be engaged, and that doesnt necessarily mean boots on the ground in every occasion, Bush said. He said that Obama cast everyone who doesnt agree with him as warmongers. Thats just not the case., He was succinct when asked about an issue that has confounded some prospective GOP presidential candidates in recent days: whether parents should vaccinate their children to help prevent outbreaks such as the current spread of measles., Parents ought to make sure their children are vaccinated. Do we need to get into any detail on that? he said, to applause from the audience.

{"Content": "[[, With the economy limping but no obvious contenders offering a more compelling fiscal strategy, Japanese voters on Sunday gave Prime Minister Shinzo Abes Liberal Democratic Party a fresh mandate to forge on with his reforms, known as Abenomics., Japans national broadcaster, NHK, predicted late Sunday that the Liberal Democrats and their coalition partner, the New Komeito Party, would together win at least 324 of the 475 seats in the lower house of parliament, a two-thirds majority., Abe called the snap elections last month even though his approval ratings were faltering amid several scandals and news that the country had officially tipped into recession. But turnout was just 52%  the lowest in the postwar era  and political scientists, economists and foreign diplomacy experts say the Abe win didnt necessarily mean the ruling party had stellar support among the public., The Liberal Democrats are the lesser evil, said Yoshihisa Hara, a political scientist and professor emeritus at Tokyo International University. There are seven opposition parties and they are splintered, noted Hara. In contrast, the Liberal Democrats have held together., Voter Miho Kobayashi, 20, a Tokyo office worker, agreed. She voted for the Liberal Democrats, she said, because they seem better than the other parties and appear stable., The most formidable opposition party is the Democratic Party of Japan, but it fell out of public favor two years ago. Then there is the Japan Innovation Party, which aims to decentralize Japans current government structure and give municipalities more power. Others have hopeful names such as the New Renaissance Party, Peoples Life Party and the Party for Future Generations, which counts former Tokyo governor and nationalist Shintaro Ishihara as a member. The Happiness Realization Party, a religious political group, is part of the mix, along with the Japanese Communist Party and Social Democratic Party., Hideo Kumano, executive chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo, said the timing of the election was a result of problems with Abes Cabinet. In October, scandals erupted involving three ministers., First, there was a funding scandal with then-Trade Minister Yuko Obuchi. Next came a campaign fund-use scandal by then-Minister of Justice Midori Matsushima. The uproar prompted both women to quickly resign., These were followed by a third incident. Office staff for the new trade minister, Yoichi Miyazawa, were found to be submitting government expense reports for trips to an S&M sex bar., Noriko Hama, economics professor at the Graduate School of Business at Doshisha University in Kyoto, said the Abe administration probably wanted to have elections before the public could render a more definitive verdict on Abenomics., The prime minister has pledged to revive Japans economy with a mix of measures including monetary easing and efforts to weaken the yen, making exports more competitive. In April, Abe raised the nations consumption tax from 5% to 8% in a bid to help reduce the national debt, but was forced to delay plans for another hike planned next year amid news that Japans gross domestic product dropped at an annualized 7.3% rate in the second quarter and 1.9% in the third quarter., Hama said the Abe administration has an outdated view of the economy and that the depreciation of the yen hasnt helped boost the economy. Japan, she said, has become an import-dependent economy and produces value-added products, so the mechanism that worked in the past isnt going to work as well now., People voted for Abe in hope born out of desperation, said Hama., Keiichiro Kobayashi, economics professor at Keio University in Tokyo, said the cheaper yen has been helping Japanese manufacturers. But the structural reforms Abe has hoped to implement  such as creating national strategic economic zones and introducing healthcare system reforms  havent been progressing as planned, Kobayashi said., One U.S. dollar currently buys about 120 Japanese yen, up 20% since early 2014., That shift has hurt households and small- and medium-sized businesses in the short term and may result in a policy failure unless it lasts for a few years and starts bringing manufacturing jobs  many of which have gone overseas  back to Japan, he said., The Japanese economy may improve in 2015 as effects from the April consumption-tax hike begin to dissipate and global oil price declines trickle down to cheaper prices for consumers, said Kobayashi. This could result in a rebound in Abes approval ratings, Kobayashi suggested., The most recent opinion poll by the local press gave Abe an approval rating of around 42%, with his disapproval rating being the same., Takashi Horie, associate professor of political science at Tokyo Metropolitan University, said a portion of the Japanese public supports Abe because the stock market has been rallying and that has led to many thinking the economy may be doing better., But not much has changed since Abe became prime minister two years ago, said Horie. Actual wages, he noted, have been falling for 16 months straight., One area Abe may be improving in lately is diplomatic relations with China, said Ichiro Korogi, professor of contemporary Chinese Studies at the Kanda University of International Studies in Chiba., The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Beijing in November brought together Chinese President Xi Jinping and Abe for a brief meeting. After a few years of conflict over a disputed group of islands and lingering historical issues from World War II, the terse and tense interchange was nevertheless seen as a small step forward. Both sides agreed on a few measures aimed at reducing the chance of any military confrontation caused by misunderstandings over such issues., With Sundays election win, Abe is likely to try to win two-thirds of the upper house seats in elections in 2016, said Hara. If he were to succeed in getting two-thirds majorities in both chambers, Abe could decide to renew his efforts to modify Japans pacifist constitutional restrictions to allow for a greater range of military activities, said Hara, the scholar., Abe wants to amend Article Nine of the Japanese Constitution, which restricts Japans military capabilities, said Hara. Abe, he added, is taking a page from his grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi (who was Japans prime minister from 1957 to 1960). Abe wants to carry out Kishis wishes to amend Article Nine, said Hara., Some Tokyo voters, including retiree Kazumi Urakami, 85, expressed concerns over Abes military aspirations as well as a new state secrets act that just kicked in; she voted for the Democratic Party. Other voters are skeptical about the governments policy to restart nuclear power reactors in the aftermath of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant meltdown in 2011., The majority though, said they were willing to give Abe more time to prove himself., Id like to see how the economic reforms by Abe will turn out, said Tokyo office worker Kazumi Usuda, 40, who voted for Abes Liberal Democrats., Nagano is a special correspondent.]", "Date": "20141214", "Title": "[Japan's Abe wins mandate in downbeat election]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-japan-abe-wins-downbeat-election-20141214-story.html", "Author": "NULL"}
{"Content": "[[, With the nations political discourse seemingly as polarized as ever here in the early going of the 2016 presidential campaign, a new Gallup poll finds that people who self-describe their attitudes on social issues as liberal or conservative have reached parity at 31% each. Its the first time self-described social conservatives havent outnumbered social liberals since Gallup began asking the question in 1999., What that means as a practical matter is a bit unclear. Gallup says that as part of a years-long trend, more Democrats now self-identify as liberal on social issues, and fewer Republicans consider themselves to be social conservatives. The total percentage of Americans on the left and right on social issues remained stable over time at about 60%, which means the moderate middle stayed the same size., Some of it could reflect a softening of rhetoric more than a change in beliefs. It wasnt that long ago that the right hurled liberal as an insult, much as the left now says social conservative with a sneer. So, a change in self-definition may have less to do with personal beliefs than with self-perception. As in, people who once were nervous identifying themselves as liberal now may not feel so embarrassed, and some social conservatives may no longer feel comfortable claiming that mantle., But its interesting that another recent Gallup poll found that, for the first time, a majority of Americans believe that people are born gay, rather than adopt it as a choice or are formed by environmental factors (30% still cling to that). And yet another survey found a record 60% of Americans support same-sex marriage. If we take changes in attitudes toward gays as a barometer, maybe the leftward shift in self-identification does reflect broader changes in beliefs., Gallup also notes that the conservative-liberal divide on economic issues remains wide, which may suggest that general philosophies arent changing, just attitudes tied to the culture war. Which unfortunately, still drives our political campaigns., From the most recent Gallup report:, Americans growing social liberalism is evident not only in how they describe their views on social issues but also in changes in specific attitudes, such as increased support for same-sex marriage and legalizing marijuana. These longer-term trends may be attributable to changing attitudes among Americans of all ages, but they also may be a result of population changes, with younger, more liberal Americans entering adulthood while older, more conservative adults pass on. Gallup found evidence that population replacement is a factor in explaining changes in overall ideology using an analysis of birth cohorts over time., The 2016 presidential election will thus be contested in a more socially liberal electorate -- and a less economically conservative one -- than was true of prior elections. Economically and socially conservative candidates may still appeal to the Republican Party base in the primaries, but it may be more important now than in the past for the GOP nominee to be a bit less conservative on social issues in order to appeal to the broader general electorate., Of course, its way too soon to try to figure out how that might play out in the 2016 election, particularly since the electoral college landscape trumps broad societal trends and a national vote. As Paul Starr explored in the American Prospect last year, the nation over time has self-sorted into clusters of like-mindedness (not exclusively, but predominately), and the red-blue divide also reflects our pre-Civil War history, a nation dividedamong slave states and free-labor states (with intertwined economies)., The current political map, to be sure, does not divide exactly along North-South lines, Starr wrote. Some rural areas in the North are socially and politically more like the South, while some urban areas in the South are more like the North. The West has its own divisions. But the regional and racial continuities are unmistakable. The South continues to be the principal base of support for a party favoring harsher policies toward labor and the poor and drawing its support almost entirely from whites. The Souths culture and religion pervade the version of conservatism that dominates the Republican Party., An electoral college map of the 2012 results, when President Obama fought off a challenge from Mitt Romney, reflects the split, with the added clarifying point that the Great Plains states as far north as the Canadian border (except for Colorado and New Mexico) joined the Southern states in voting Republican. Scientific American has a slide show of some interesting map variations that try to capture some of the subtlety inherent in the typical red-blue divide., But with the winner-take-all, state-by-state electoral college system*, subtle changes in national attitudes on social issues dont necessarily mean much for a presidential election. But they could affect who wins the party nominations, particularly for the Republicans., Regardless, from my perspective a political shift toward tolerance and inclusiveness is something to be welcomed and nurtured., -----, * Except for Maine and Nebraska, which divvy up their electoral votes by giving two to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each congressional district (Maine has two, Nebraska has three)., Follow Scott Martelle on Twitter @smartelle.]", "Date": "20150522", "Title": "[A look at the nation's leftward shift on social issues]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-liberals-conservatives-gay-rights-presdiential-election-20150522-story.html", "Author": "[Scott Martelle]"}
{"Content": "[[, With the rise of Islamic State extremists and growing instability overseas, national security is taking on greater prominence in the 2016 presidential race, theoretically giving Republicans an edge on an issue they have traditionally dominated., But as GOP presidential hopefuls try to appeal to their conservative base with familiar calls for a muscular military posture and increased Pentagon spending, the party is struggling to articulate a coherent message that strikes a contrast to President Obamas without alienating a war-weary populace or widening internal GOP divisions., Even more problematic, Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton presents an unusually formidable challenger for the ever-expanding list of Republicans: Most of them have thin resumes on national security compared with a former secretary of State already viewed by many in her own party as somewhat hawkish., The increasingly aggressive national security stance of Republican candidates was on full display this week, for example in former Florida Gov. Jeb Bushs misstep over questions about whether he would have invaded Iraq in 2003, and in Florida Sen. Marco Rubios policy speech Wednesday, which was long on promises but short on specific policies., In many ways, Republicans should welcome a discussion on national security, particularly because they are the party that voters frequently have depended upon to confront Americas enemies. At the same time, the U.S. economy, as a campaign issue, has slipped as a top concern among many voters amid an improving job market., Polls show that for Republican voters, national security ranks higher than pocketbook issues., Theres no doubt national security has risen on the most-important-issues list, said Whit Ayres, a Republican strategist who has worked with Rubios campaign. Its very clear that America wants a more muscular foreign policy than it has seen in the Obama years, and thats particularly true of Republican voters., But as Jeb Bush discovered, the issue is not as straightforward as it once was. President George W. Bushs prolonged wars in Iraq and Afghanistan heavily tarnished Republicans reputation on national security and foreign affairs., Despite lingering disapproval over the Iraq war, Jeb Bush said this week that even with the benefit of hindsight, he would have launched the 2003 invasion., Predictably, Democrats pounced, but so did many conservatives., There has to be something wrong with you. You cant think going into Iraq  as a sane human being, was the right thing to do, conservative radio host Laura Ingraham said. Its a sneak peek as to what Jeb is going to face come the general election should he win the nomination., Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor who, like Bush, has yet to officially announce his candidacy for the Republican nomination, piled on. I dont think you can honestly say that if we knew then that there were no [weapons of mass destruction], that the country should have gone to war, he told CNN., A spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, Mo Elleithee, simply said, Hes joking, right?, When asked his position, Rubio said, Not only would I not have been in favor of it, but President Bush would not have been in favor of it., Jeb Bush tried to walk back his remarks, saying he had misunderstood the question. But when offered another chance to answer the question, he seemed to make matters worse, saying he wasnt sure what he would have done in such a hypothetical. On Wednesday in Nevada, he suggested that even asking such a question was a disservice to those killed in the conflict., Bush isnt the only presidential hopeful struggling on national security. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has been trying to downplay his previous image as an isolationist, which had put him at odds with an increasing number of Republican voters as well as the hawkish wing of his party., The divide was on display last month in Congress when Rubio and Paul squared off over defense spending in the annual budget. Rubio led efforts to increase Pentagon spending, but Paul and another presidential contender, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), voted against the bill, saying the military funding should have been offset by cuts elsewhere., Defense hawks won that battle against deficit hawks, perhaps a reflection of rising voter interest in a beefed-up national security stance., Hoping to burnish his military credentials, Paul staged a recent foreign policy address in front of the aircraft carrier Yorktown in South Carolina., Wisconsins Republican Gov. Scott Walker, meanwhile, has tried to increase his international experience with trips to Britain and Israel., Rubio, who claims to have more foreign policy experience than other candidates as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, displayed familiar Republican tough talk during his national security speech., American strength is a means of preventing war, not promoting it, he said at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York., Rubio portrayed himself as influenced by Presidents Kennedy and Reagan to set forth a doctrine for the exercise of American influence in the world, including protecting U.S. economic interests in a globally connected marketplace., I will use American power to oppose any violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace or outer space, he said., This includes the economic disruption caused when one country invades another, as well as the chaos caused by disruptions in choke points, Rubio said, adding that any nation that attempts to block global commerce will know to expect a response from my administration., Rubio called Clinton a leader from yesterday whose tenure as secretary of State was ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst., But attacks against Democrats as too soft may not be enough, analysts say. To convince voters, Republican candidates will need to offer viable alternatives. Although public opinion of Obamas handling of national security hit a low point last year, polls show most Americans agree with his reluctance to commit U.S. military forces abroad and his willingness to engage in diplomacy, such as talks to rein in Irans nuclear program., Even though Americans have heightened national security concerns, Im not sure theyre ready to go back to this George W. Bush approach, said Brian Katulis, a national security analyst at the left-leaning Center for American Progress., A lot of Americans think: Been there, done that, he said. There is this deep chagrin and regret over all that was lost and squandered, especially after the Iraq war  even among those centrist, pragmatic Republicans, no matter what the polling says., For the latest from Congress follow @LisaMascaro., 4:56 p.m.: Updated throughout., This story was first published at 4 a.m.]", "Date": "20150513", "Title": "[As voters fret over national security, GOP candidates seek right message]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-republicans-national-security-20150513-story.html", "Author": "[Lisa Mascaro]"}
{"Content": "[[, With the White House nailing down crucial Democratic support for its nuclear deal with Iran this week, the fight in Congress about the agreement looked to be all over but the shouting., So on Wednesday, the shouting began., A lineup of conservative politicians and media figures, including rival GOP presidential candidates Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz, rallied opponents of the deal on Capitol Hill with intense rhetoric and nuclear winter imagery. Inside the Capitol, Republicans struggled to agree on how to move forward with an all-but-doomed effort to block the multinational agreement. Meanwhile, Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton revealed how she plans to navigate the tricky politics of defending the pact, striking a newly hawkish stance., TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>, If the agreement goes forward as expected, \"the single most important issue in 2016 will be stopping Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon,\" Cruz declared to thousands gathered under the sun on the West Lawn of the Capitol. \"And any commander-in-chief worthy of defending this nation should be prepared to stand up on Jan. 20, 2017, and rip to shreds this catastrophic deal.\", Its far from clear that voters will agree with Cruzs assessment of the role that the agreement, in which Iran agrees to limit its nuclear program and allow independent inspections in exchange for the U.S. and five other world powers lifting crippling economic sanctions, will play in the presidential election., Polling shows the public debate has not yet penetrated beyond pockets of passionate constituencies. A Pew Research poll released Tuesday found that support for the deal has fallen 12 percentage points since it was announced in July, to 21%, while opposition is holding essentially steady at around 45%. The number of people who have no opinion and little awareness of the deal, however, has grown., That group will be the target of both Democrats and Republicans as the presidential campaign kicks into high gear this fall, and Wednesday offered a preview of the persuasion tactics., In a speech at the Brookings Institution in Washington, Clinton sought to assuage the deep concerns of Israels supporters, whose money and votes she needs for her presidential bid, with an accord that she said is the worlds best hope to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb., \"Either we move forward on the path of diplomacy and seize this chance to block Irans path to a nuclear weapon or we turn down a more dangerous path leading to a far less certain and riskier future,\" Clinton said., But Clinton also made clear that \"there is absolutely no reason to trust Iran,\" as she offered a notably hawkish strategy for pressuring Tehran to abide by the agreement, shoring up Israeli security and thwarting the alliances Iran has with organizations the U.S. considers to be terrorist., \"This is not the start of some diplomatic opening,\" Clinton said. \"My starting point will be one of distrust.... We should anticipate that Iran will test the next president. They will want to see how far they can bend the rules. That will not work if I am in the White House.\", Such reassurances would probably have little impact on the conservatives gathered at the rally organized by the Tea Party Patriots, a group that helped arrange the protests against President Obamas healthcare law years earlier. Speakers argued that the deal could result in nuclear destruction, killing millions, and quoted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus assertion that it represented an \"existential threat\" to Israel. Protesters carried signs reading \"What part of death to America, death to Israel, dont you understand?\", \"After World War II, the world made a promise after we saw the slaughter of innocents: never again,\" said TV host and author Glenn Beck. \"Never again is now. In time, Iran will be able to accomplish more than Hitler did.\" Former GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin and former Rep. Michele Bachmann also addressed the group., Trump also cast the deal as a threat to Israel  but he did not go as far in his rhetoric or his promises as Cruz. Trump has not vowed to rip up the deal if elected, but to \"police\" and \"renegotiate\" it., \"Never, ever, ever in my life have I seen any transaction so incompetently negotiated as our deal with Iran. And I mean never,\" he said Wednesday. \"We are led by very, very stupid people.\", If elected, he would negotiate a deal that would free four American prisoners in Iran before he took office, he said, and America will start \"winning\" again., \"We will have so much winning if I get elected that you may get bored with winning,\" he said to cheers. \"Believe me. I agree. Youll never get bored with winning. We never get bored.\", The rally was Trumps first high-profile trip to Capitol Hill since becoming the front-runner for the GOP nomination, and it was little surprise that he chose not to visit with his partys increasingly unpopular congressional leadership, but instead to rally outside the Capitol., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio were repeatedly booed by the crowd. Although 42 senators aligned with Democrats have declared their support for the deal, giving the White House enough votes to keep the Senate from even sending a disapproval resolution to the president, Cruz said the two Republican leaders could block the deal if they wanted., He argued that GOP leadership could claim that the White House had not met the deadline for disclosing the terms of the deal to Congress because \"side deals\" with Iran have not been detailed. Enough House Republicans agreed, in an unexpected setback for Boehner. The House was expected to move ahead with its disapproval resolution on Wednesday, but a key procedural vote was abruptly delayed as lawmakers debated new strategies to stop the deal., Despite the debate, the outcome seemed clear and the White House seemed confident of its success. Spokesman Eric Schultz mocked the House Republicans plan as something informally \"hatched up\" at the last minute., kathleen.hennessey@latimes.com;tomanmiller@latimes.com, Twitter: @khennessey;@tomanmiller, Times staff writers Evan Halper and Lisa Mascaro in Washington and Christi Parsons in Warren, Mich., contributed to this report.]", "Date": "20150909", "Title": "[Republicans rally to denounce Iran deal, despite dwindling chances of stopping it]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-iran-deal-politics-20150910-story.html", "Author": "[Kathleen Hennessey]"}
{"Content": "[[, Within minutes of the Supreme Courts decision declaring a constitutional right for same-sex couples to marry, President Obama joined the celebration, calling one of the gay plaintiffs to congratulate him on live television, then going to the Rose Garden to hail Fridays ruling as a moment when \"slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt.\", Almost simultaneously, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, one of the leading Republicans in the race to succeed Obama, denounced the decision as a \"grave mistake\" and called for a constitutional amendment to reverse it. Another GOP hopeful, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, said the high court had \"crossed from the realm of activism into the arena of oligarchy,\" and called for a constitutional amendment to allow voters to remove Supreme Court justices from office., By contrast, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, also seeking the Republican nomination, stepped softly, saying only that he thought \"the Supreme Court should have allowed the states to make this decision.\" GOP candidate Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said: \"While I disagree with this decision, we live in a republic and must abide by the law.\", The widely different approaches highlighted how gay rights  same-sex marriage, in particular  continue to divide and shape American politics., Republicans running for president face a choice in responding to the courts ruling. They could try to use the strong emotions same-sex marriages evoke as a way to mobilize conservative voters in primaries, but potentially at the cost of undermining their campaigns in next years general election. Or they could seize on the finality of a Supreme Court ruling as a way of avoiding an issue on which their party is out of step with the majority of voters, but at the risk of alienating conservatives who see the court decision as a violation of deeply held religious principles., How they choose to navigate the issue will help determine whether the vast majority of the country quickly accepts the courts ruling, as happened with the decision to wipe out laws against interracial marriage nearly half a century ago, or whether it will remain divisive for years to come., As recently as a decade ago, Republicans were able to use gay rights to drive a wedge between Democrats and swing voters. But the rapid shift in public opinion  one of the swiftest changes on a major issue that pollsters have recorded  has reshaped the political landscape to the detriment of the GOP., Today, as many surveys have shown, a growing majority of Americans favor allowing same-sex couples to legally marry. Currently, about 3 in 5 Americans take that position, up from fewer than half just five years ago., Those same surveys also show that the voters who care most about the issue tend to be those strongly opposed to the change. Among self-described conservative Republicans, a group adamantly against same-sex marriage, 40% said in a poll last month by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center that they view the issue as \"very important.\", As a result, Republicans seeking the presidency find themselves pulled between a desire to appeal to the older, conservative voters who dominate GOP primaries in many states and the views of the larger electorate, particularly younger Americans, who regard marriage equality as an important civil right., Democrats moved quickly to heighten that tension and reinforce their support among backers of gay rights. Hillary Rodham Clinton, for example, issued a statement praising the courts decision and calling for the country to go further and outlaw employment discrimination against gays and lesbians. The Obama administration announced that the White House would be lighted up Friday night with a rainbow display, a symbol of the gay rights movement., Republican reactions, by contrast, displayed a sharp split, not on the merits of the decision, which all the partys leading candidates opposed, but in how to respond to it., Walker, Cruz, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and other candidates on the partys right are all seeking to consolidate support among conservative voters. That gives them a strong incentive to push issues such as same-sex marriage to the forefront, and they moved to do so in the hours after the ruling., While Walker backed amending the Constitution to overturn the courts decision, others pledged support for individuals  business owners, for example  who feel their religious beliefs would be violated if they were to participate in a same-sex wedding. Huckabee warned against \"surrender\" to the courts decree, but did not say what form of resistance he advocated., By contrast, presidential hopefuls including Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who seek support from more moderate Republicans, sought to downplay the issue., \"This is something that should be decided by the people of each state and not imposed upon them by a group of lawyers sitting in black robes at the U.S. Supreme Court,\" Christie said. \"That being said, those five lawyers get to impose it under our system, and so our job is going to be to support the law of the land.\", Dan Schnur, a veteran Republican strategist who now directs the Jesse Unruh Institute of Politics at USC, suggested that \"you can tell a lot about the candidates for president by the way they reacted to todays decision.\", \"Those who think the way to win a general election is by persuading undecided voters are saying, Lets move on. Those who think the way you win a general election is by motivating the base say, This means war,\" Schnur said. \"The Bushes and the Rubios will quietly disagree with the decision and then try to move on. The Walkers and the Jindals will try to use this to light a fire under the Republican base.\", Curt Anderson, the chief strategist for Jindals campaign, said Republicans can benefit by standing up for their principles even if the polls are against them., \"Political parties can always say, Oh well, some of our principles have fallen out of favor, so lets jettison them,\" Anderson said. \"I dont think thats generally a bright idea.\", Voters will stand with a candidate despite disagreement on a specific issue if they see him or her as someone who is not \"mean-spirited,\" Anderson said., But the idea that the U.S. has a latent conservative majority just waiting to be mobilized by the right candidate is not a view widely shared among Republican strategists., \"The Republican Party has lost the popular vote in five of the last six elections not because conservatives havent turned out,\" said Steve Schmidt, who served as senior advisor to John McCains presidential campaign in 2008 and has since become a vocal critic of the partys right wing., \"The notion that there will be a constitutional amendment\" to end same-sex marriage is \"delusional,\" Schmidt said., Young people in particular have come to regard same-sex marriage as the norm. Moving past the issue could give Republicans a chance to focus on education, the economy and other issues that might prove more fruitful, said John Della Volpe, a Harvard pollster and expert on the youth vote., \"Thats helpful to being competitive in a general election,\" he said., Ultimately, said political analyst Stuart Rothenberg, \"Republicans dont want the 2016 election to be a referendum on same-sex marriage.\", \"It may suit [Rick] Santorum and Huckabee and Jindal from a political point of view to rally social conservatives and the evangelical base and make them angry and make them frustrated and try to emerge as the social-conservative alternative,\" Rothenberg said., But, he added, \"to the extent to which it becomes an emotional issue, an angry issue, an issue that makes Republicans look less tolerant, less inclusive, less welcoming  thats a problem.\", Twitter: @DavidLauter, Twitter: @markzbarabak]", "Date": "20150626", "Title": "[A GOP conundrum: How does a 2016 candidate play the same-sex marriage ruling?]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-marriage-politics-20150627-story.html", "Author": "[David Lauter, Mark Z.

{"Content": "[[, Women have long enjoyed a key advantage in Californias strong Democratic political ecosystem: Sheer numbers., Polling taken before last Novembers election underscored the obvious: 56% of Democrats were women, clocking men by 12 percentage points. Evidence of their power can be seen in the forms of Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, who 23 years ago became the nations first all-woman Senate team largely on a surge of support from women voters., But in an alarming turn for the states dominant political party, women are vanishing from its legislative ranks, traditionally the training ground for federal or statewide office., California in 2003 was fifth among states ranked by the percentage of its Legislators who were women, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. But the state now finds itself mired in a surprising 20th place., All of the lost ground has come at the expense of Democratic women. At the high water mark a decade ago, 31 Democratic women served in the Legislature. Now, 19 do. At the same time, Republicans have doubled their strength from six women members a decade ago to 12 now., \"Its obvious to me theres something not exactly right,\" said Mary Hughes, a veteran political strategist. \"There are a lot of factors and they converged to create a backslide.\", The first factor is the pipeline. Studies nationally have found that fewer women than men consider running for political office. Thats generally blamed on the toxic environment that envelops many races these days, from beginning contests at the school board level to the presidential level. There is the tendency of women to require themselves to be perfectly matched to a task before embarking on it, and their desire to accomplish something  an ambition that they may not see as possible in a sharply partisan legislature., \"They look at this business of politics and think: Is it worth my time and energy?\" said Katie Merrill, a Bay Area Democratic consultant who has taken part in multiple gatherings meant to encourage women to run., As Merrill noted, there are other avenues of political exercise besides seeking office. (Hillary Rodham Clintons presidential campaign is relying heavily on women active on her behalf.), \"They can get involved in campaigns, they can raise money,\" she said. \"That may be enough for them.\", Although views differ, mechanical reasons may account for some of the slump in women Democrats. Term limits have forced out some pioneers. And the primary system, in which two candidates move on to the general election regardless of party, has occasionally pitted women against each other and paved the way for a mans election., But if those conditions were the cause, Republican women should be feeling the effects as well  and yet they are gaining ground rather than losing it. Another element may be in play: the potent ambitions that accompanied the \"Year of the Woman\" in 1992, in which Democratic women senators such as Feinstein and Boxer swept in, have eased as women politicians have become more common. (Among Republican women, who did not see their ranks grow in the 1990s, that fierce desire is evident now.), \"Women are establishment candidates now  look at the presidential race, where Hillary Clinton is the establishment candidate,\" Merrill said. \"There isnt that sense that theres an underrepresentation of women in politics, even though there is. There isnt an urgency like there used to be.\", Women voters, particularly Democrats, may look at their two senators, the plethora of women on their city councils and school boards, and see parity. But even in the House delegation, where 19 of 53 California seatsor 36%  are held by women, parity is an illusion., That is part of the problem, according to Hughes, who in 2013 founded a group called Close the Gap CA to press for the election of Democratic women. Sociologists, she said, say members need to account for 30% of an institution before they have a pivotal role  and that is a mark hit by few political entities., \"Yes, women are changing the institutions that they serve in, but there are not yet enough of them to really reshape the culture of those institutions,\" she said, in a way that might serve to attract more women candidates., Groups like Hughes are seeking to alter the calculus by recruiting women candidates, educating them about what they can accomplish, providing them a floor of support and preparing them for the rigors of a campaign., Of 20 seats targeted by her group in 2016, she said that at least 14 have promising candidates, though some remain unannounced., The ongoing presidential campaign features two women candidates  Clinton and Republican Carly Fiorina. The 2016 U.S. Senate race here features two Democratic women  Kamala Harris, the state attorney general, and Rep. Loretta Sanchez of Orange County. But beneath those marquee races, a struggle is ongoing to build numbers that once were far bigger than they are now., \"The Year of the Woman in 1992  we never finished that,\" Merrill said. \"Its ongoing, and its long term.\", cathleen.decker@latimes.com, Twitter: @cathleendecker, For more on politics, go to www.latimes.com/decker.]", "Date": "20150823", "Title": "[Democratic women seek to regain lost ground in Sacramento]", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-pol-california-politics-women-20150823-story.html", "Author": "[Cathleen Decker]"}
{"Content": "[[, World affairs are constants in Jeb Bushs life., He met his wife while a teenager studying in Mexico, majored in Latin American affairs in college and lived in Venezuela as a young businessman. He speaks fluent Spanish., He had a front-row seat to the presidencies of his brother and his father during times of great overseas triumph and tribulation., Bush, 62, spent the bulk of his adult life in south Florida, one of the most multicultural places in the nation. As governor of Florida, he led more than a dozen international missions, and he has visited 29 countries since then., But Bush still feels compelled to embark on a modern-day rite of passage for presidential candidates  an overseas tour to showcase his statesmanship and burnish his foreign policy credentials. This week, he will take a whirlwind spin through the capitals of Germany, Poland and Estonia before officially kicking off his White House bid on June 15., The trip is a nod to the dominant role foreign policy is expected to play in the 2016 presidential campaign  one of Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clintons top credentials is her tenure as the nations top diplomat. Voters, increasingly alarmed by developments overseas such as Islamic States brutality and the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran, are expected to prioritize foreign policy experience as they select the next president., A foreign trip offers candidates upsides: a chance to be seen as a strong, capable leader on the world stage addressing issues vital to the nations interests. But as some of Bushs Republican rivals can attest, any error could be magnified., Bush faces an additional, unique test  differentiating his views from the foreign policies of his father, President George H.W. Bush, and his brother, President George W. Bush. The former governor has yet to articulate an agenda, but he frequently seeks to distinguish himself from the two presidents., \"Just for the record, one more time: I love my brother, I love my dad,\" Bush said during a foreign policy speech in February in Chicago. \"And I admire their service to the nation and the difficult decisions that they had to make. But Im my own man, and my views are shaped by my own thinking and my own experiences.\", Bush noted how much the world had changed since his father formed a coalition to fight the Gulf War in 1991 and his brother invaded Iraq in 2003. Then he emphasized: \"New circumstances require new approaches.\", For a candidate whose biggest campaign stumble to date was his difficulty answering a question about the war his brother started, its a recognition that his familial ties cut both ways., The shadows of the two elder Bushes loom large in the nations the former governor is visiting., In Germany, for example, President George H.W. Bush is remembered fondly for his role in the negotiations for German unification after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, said Kori Schake, who was a senior foreign policy aide in President George W. Bushs administration., But George W. Bushs policies after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, such as the preemptive use of military force, prompted hand-wringing among Germans, she said., \"They thought they knew us,\" Schake said. \"Our reaction after 9/11 scared them.\", Bush will spend much of his five-day trip meeting privately with government, business and civic leaders in Berlin, Warsaw and Tallinn, Estonia, about the economy, transatlantic relations and security. Public events include a Tuesday speech at a major economic conference in Berlin alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves., The former governor is expected to be asked about Russian aggression in Ukraine, and whether the United States has been a strong enough ally in the region. NATO, of which the United States is a member, is being urged to more forcefully confront Russian President Vladimir Putin by permanently stationing troops in Poland and the Baltic nations., He could face questions about the CIA torture report, made public in 2014, that confirmed the existence of a secret interrogation site in Poland during his brothers administration, and President Obamas decision to scale back George W. Bush-era plans to build a missile-defense site in Poland., Policy experts said Bushs challenge would be to showcase his views without explicitly attacking Obama on foreign soil., \"Obviously you want to demonstrate how youll be able to contrast your foreign policy if youre president.... But at the same time, you have to do it delicately,\" said Lanhee Chen, a top advisor to 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. \"Foreign policy and national security are going to be a huge part of this campaign, and theyre going to be a huge part of how Republican candidates contrast themselves with the current administration  and also potentially with other Republican candidates.\", Such overseas journeys have repeatedly proved perilous for American politicians., Romneys foreign trip in the summer before the 2012 election was dominated by missteps. In Britain, he offended many when he questioned Londons readiness to host the Summer Olympics shortly before the Games opening ceremony. In Jerusalem, he suggested that \"culture\" was responsible for economic disparities between Israel and neighboring Palestinian areas., \"I dont think it was a defining moment during the campaign, but at that point of the campaign, you cant afford to lose many news cycles, and we lost a couple,\" said Kevin Madden, a Romney advisor who faulted the campaign for failing to craft an overarching thematic narrative for the trip. In the absence of such messaging, Romneys missteps were exaggerated, he said., This year, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie flubbed a response when asked about mandatory childhood vaccinations while in London; he appeared to side with those who oppose vaccinations. At the same time, reports emerged about lavish trips he took that were funded by wealthy benefactors., Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker in February took flack for dodging questions about his views on foreign policy and creationism at a prominent think tank in London., Bushs life experiences, some argue, inoculate him from such blunders., \"So many of our GOP presidential candidates are using flash cards to try to memorize the different world leaders, and theyre traveling overseas to prove they can remember the name of a leader or a group,\" said Richard Grenell, who served as the U.S. spokesman at the United Nations under President George W. Bush and is not aligned with any candidate. \"This isnt an educational trip for Jeb Bush.\", But others wonder about the wisdom of making such a venture., \"The upside is limited but obvious and that is you get your picture taken with the queen of Siam or wherever youre going,\" said Rich Galen, a veteran GOP operative who worked for former Vice President Dan Quayle and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. \"The downside, as Scott Walker found out, is that if you do one of these foreign trips  especially now  you damn well better know what the hell youre talking about.\", Times staff writer Mark Z.

{"Content": "[[, Yes, this is the campaign season that just wont end. On Saturday, voters in Louisiana will gather, a month after most states voted, for a runoff for a U.S. Senate seat and some House races., But even then, its not over., Election officials in Arizona this week cranked up the machinery for a recount of one particularly close House seat that has Republican challenger Martha McSally 161 votes ahead of Democratic incumbent Ron Barber. The recount in the 2nd Congressional District race was required because the margin was fewer than 200 votes out of nearly 120,000 cast., Barber won the seat in the aftermath of tragedy. He was an aide to Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in January 2011 when she was shot in the head in an assassination attempt. Barber was one of 12 people injured by gunfire that day. After his recovery and Giffords resignation, Barber won the seat in a June 2012 special election., In the 2012 general election, when he narrowly defeated McSally, Barber benefited from a heavily Democratic electorate; this year, he was fighting a Republican surge., Since the election, Barbers lawyers have argued that election errors denied scores of Arizonans the right to cast ballots. McSallys representatives have countered that some of those voters would have been ineligible under state law., Its not the first time Arizona elections have run into overtime.
