{"Content": "[Democratic state legislator Isadore Hall, who won his state Senate seat in a special election just two months ago, said Thursday he would run for Rep. Janice Hahns U.S. House post if she decides to try for Los Angeles County supervisor next year. An advisor to Hahn said Wednesday the San Pedro Democrat was weighing a 2016 run to succeed 4th District Supervisor Don Knabe, who must leave office then due to term limits. Hahn advisor Dave Jacobson said she would make up her mind soon about whether to stay in Congress or run for the board where her late father, the legendary Kenneth Hahn, held a seat for four decades. Janice Hahns possible election bid for one of the most powerful local government boards in the nation already has touched off a scramble by prospective candidates to succeed her in Congress. Los Angeles City Councilman Joe Buscaino, who succeeded Hahn on the council, on Wednesday expressed interest in the congressional seat if she decides to relinquish it for the supervisors race. Hall, of Compton, was unequivocal on Thursday. \"If Congresswoman Hahn decides not to run for reelection and instead runs for county supervisor, I will run for [her] congressional seat -- regardless of who else enters the race,\" Hall said in a statement. \"I will not hesitate and I will enter the race fully focused and determined on winning it,\" he added. Hall, who had been a state assemblyman since 2008, succeeded state Sen. Roderick Wright (D-Inglewood), when Wright left office shortly after a jury convicted him of eight felonies for lying about his residency to qualify for the Senate district seat.
