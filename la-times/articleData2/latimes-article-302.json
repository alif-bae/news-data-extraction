FOX News anchors Chris Wallace, Megyn Kelly and Bret Baier, left to right, moderate the first prime-time 2016 Republican presidential debate in Cleveland on Aug. 6. Thats more chatter than during the State of the Union address earlier this year (5.6 million people made 14 million interactions) and the 24 hours around Donald Trumps campaign announcement in June (3.4 million people made 6.4 million interactions). More than 40,000 people responded via Facebook to Fox News call for candidate questions, and analysts said the debate reinforced the social networks growth and importance in the 2016 election. \"I think youre seeing that Facebook is reasserting itself as the place where dialogue happens, and that also includes politics and entertainment,\" said Jason Cieslak, Pacific Rim president at global branding firm Siegel+Gale. \"It speaks to the maturation of the company that they chose to do something that was extraordinarily mainstream.\", Facebook already has a tremendous amount of brand recognition, and Fox News call for questions allowed it to bring even more interest to the debate, said Rob Gregory, chief revenue officer for digital media company WhoSay, which connects celebrities with brands. But the companys ubiquity, on everything from pizza boxes to the local dry cleaners window, may have made the publicity irrelevant. \"Im just not sure that it really helped to better define the brand or send a brand message about Facebook in any particular way,\" Gregory said. \"Theyre so big now, you would almost expect them to be there.\", Facebooks role in the debate also indicates that candidates think the social network is equally important as traditional broadcast networks, but in a different way, Gregory said. Facebook allows them to reach out to a large number of everyday voters. But, he said, television is still the bully pulpit. \"The power of American television is still greater than anything else,\" Gregory said. For more business news, follow@smasunaga.
