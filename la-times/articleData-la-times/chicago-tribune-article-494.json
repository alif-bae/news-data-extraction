{"Content": "[ The last few weeks have seen momentous decisions in America  especially the Supreme Courts decisions on same-sex marriage and Obamacare. By the hundreds, readers of The Times have offered their opinions. There was approval and there was disagreement in generally thoughtful prose. A number of viewpoints were expressed, rationally. But its also campaign season. And on the stump, with a chance to look presidential, some of the candidates came across as something, well, lacking -- at least to a number of Times readers. --Sara Lessley, Letters to the Editor department, Lorraine Knopf in Santa Monica observed:, After the Supreme Courts decision on same-sex marriage, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas called for a constitutional amendment to allow voters to remove Supreme Court justices from office through periodic judicial retention election. Wouldnt it be ironic if that went through, and the voters removed justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito?, In Encino, Stan Gordon was puzzled:, I am having difficulty following the logic of Mike Huckabee and his ilk. As Huckabee said recently: \"This case wasnt so much about a matter of marriage equality, it was marriage redefinition. And I think people have to say, If youre going to have a new celebration that were not going to discriminate [against], may I ask, are we going to now discriminate against people of conscience, people of faith who may disagree with this ruling?\", So because others choose not to follow the dictates of Huckabees belief system, their difference of theology is an attack on the governors faith and he is being denied his own religious freedom. Huh?, I also find it bizarre that they use the term conservative when they spend so much effort regulating other peoples business. Stephen Hogg in Simi Valley sent a wry prediction:, I read that several of the Republican hopefuls are pledging to defy the Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage. I expect that Mississippi will impose a 72- hour waiting period; Wisconsin will require an ultrasound; and Texas will require all ceremonies be at a hospital. Larry Selwitz in Newport Beach observed:, Following the Supreme Courts ruling on gay marriage, Bobby Jindal, as well as many other conservatives, lost no time in responding that marriage between a man and a woman was established by God and no earthly court can alter that. Somehow, Gov. Jindal failed to recognize the irony that an all-powerful God can change his mind if he so pleases -- as he did last week by decreeing that the Court should rule in favor of gay marriage. Reacting to Donald Trumps recent comments about immigration, John T. Chiu in Newport Beach counseled patience:, The brouhaha over Donald Trumps comments on illegal immigrants from Mexico will do no more or less damage to the GOP than what Leland Yee and some of his errant Democrats in the state Senate have inflicted on the Democratic party. Over the years, many have regarded Trump as nothing more than an attention-getter and rarely taken him seriously. On the other hand, his demand on collecting data on crimes committed by illegal immigrants should not be ignored simply because this would violate Political Correctness. A well-done study on this subject will either confirm or debunk such assertions. Trump should be seen as a modern-day court jester, who does, however, sometimes utter the unpalatable truth. In San Bernardino, Thomas McGovern is waiting :, Trump is offering the GOP presidential candidates an opportunity to demonstrate leadership. At this point, they have all failed. Being president requires a lot of tough decisions. Ducking such an easy call on Trumps racist rant shows that none of them have what it takes. Dan Aaron in Fountain Valley commented:, Donald Trumps recent pronouncements have made it clear that the largest state in the country is Trumps ego. And in Newbury Park, Matt Singerman is watching...:, Why should we be surprised about Trumps recent hateful statements about Latino immigrants? It certainly wasnt his first foray into hate speech. It wasnt that long ago that Trump was an ardent supporter of the \"birthers,\" in demanding that President Obamas produce his birth certificate. Unless the GOP is more forceful in denouncing Trump, he could turn out to be the biggest land mine stepped on by the Republican party since the Watergate break-in.]", "Date": "20150706", "Author": "NULL", "Link": "http://www.latimes.com/opinion/readersreact/la-le-0706-readers-react-20150706-story.html", "Title": "[Don't forget about the candidates; 2016 is coming on fast]"}
