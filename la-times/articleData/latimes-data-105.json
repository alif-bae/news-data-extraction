{"Content": "[As former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa weighs a U.S. Senate bid, the California Latino Legislative Caucus on Tuesday saida Latino candidate in the mix would attract more Democratic voters to the polls for the electionnext year. State Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris is the only major candidate so far running for the Senate seat that will be vacated by Barbara Boxer. Villaraigosa is the most prominent of a handful of Latino politicians considering a run in the 2016 contest. A rush of support for Harris sparkedconsternation among Latino politicians, who have grown increasingly vocal about their concerns that thefast-growing Latino electorate is being ignored by Democratic leaders. The Latino caucus issued a statement touting a voter survey it commissioned and saying a Latino contestant in the Senate race would be a boon for all Democrats. There are many talented Latino leaders who could help energize Latino Democratic voters, said the caucus vice chair, Sen. Ben Hueso (D-San Diego). Villaraigosa is said to be close to a decision about whether to mount a Senate bid. But members of the caucus insistedthey were not pushing for any particular candidate, despite the timing of their statements. One of the goals of the Latino Caucus is to develop avenues that empower the Latino community all across the state of California, the caucus chair, Assemblyman Luis Alejo (D-Salinas), said in statement.
